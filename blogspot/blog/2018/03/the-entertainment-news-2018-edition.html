<style>    .thumbnail .hover {   display:none; } .thumbnail:hover .normal {   display:none; } .thumbnail:hover .hover {   display:inline;  /* CHANGE IF FOR BLOCK ELEMENTS */ } </style>Yah yah yah nag nag nag when will I ever stop yeah it's not over yet. Well, at least, not until I say so. Countdown four weeks to freedom. And yes, I'm not including the fact that I still have to graduate and find a f****** job lol<br /><br />Also, you watched the livestream of the first Anime I'm going to talk about below just now? Man, I hope you've enjoyed refreshing the page every single time one of those premium members among the 300k+ people (wow) walked in haha man that was rough the show wasn't though hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I'm glad she doesn't see me trying to pet that cat" I mean Nishikata YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT lol I think I found the author's recipe for success</div></blockquote>Just in case we forgot how stupid Nishikata is, we also need to remember that Takagi-san stands above all gods and fortune-telling predictions haha. The new episode (11) landed a critical hit on the master teaser so hard they can only do it now, since we know the series is about to end. Hey, and what a build up it was. We started out with Nishikata's "super niche" taste in cats (I mean, what's wrong being a cat lover?), giving it some exposure and close-ups in the Art class, and then transition to fortune-telling about love. Man, it's all working out. For who exactly? I'll leave it to you to figure it out. But what an ending. We know Takagi-san's advances and her fortunes are correct such that she can progress further to the unknowing classmate despite the boy thinking every time that she is trying to tease him. I mean, at the start it is, but I think at this point the show is leaning towards giving an unclear yet significant reply. Well, from Takagi-san maybe. Nishikata is still easy to read apparently lol. Add in Yukari-chan (lol) and her friends who think they are talking about guys (why would they?) (and yep, I nailed it the moment Mina-chan said "I like the ones with long hair" lol), and you actually get a very good overall story going. Now you know why they needed that secondary character support. Yeah, that's pretty much it. On the other hand, I'd like to criticise (as seen above in the quote) on the overuse of Nishikata's stupidity, like seriously. He is not just tsundere, but they put so many easy assumptions on the main guy, even we are starting to read his mind. Remember: Takagi-san is supposed to be the master, not us. If you drop to this level Nishikata you're going to be dumber than <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/104737/Yoshiko_Hanabatake" target="_blank">that other idiot who has been referred to by me as one for 12 episodes straight</a> haha well you're a close second btw congrats haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EreoJfcjq-4/WrcI3sRM_hI/AAAAAAAAl_w/3hsPdPUqYroTU7Jc59rhimUD0iV6zmd5ACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan11_nishikata_compare.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Similarity Index: As high as Nishikata's feelings of Takagi right now lol<br />(Takagi-san is a pretty good artist btw)</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="hover"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X8env5Iny3A/WrcJ6vgNdzI/AAAAAAAAl_4/y0qziv4wlF80E8xM8NyXJZWIhmxyockqACLcBGAs/s1600/takagisan11_petting.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">FOUND IT haha thanks animators</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S. Yukari-chan is THE SADDEST GIRL in the series, I swear. Refer to the offshot Manga series by the same author "Koi ni Koisuru Yukari-chan" and you'll get what I mean lol<br />P.P.S. Haha Takagi-san asking the REAL questions lol the broom drop from Nishikata<br />(Okay last one: I didn't even notice why the camera is making it look like he wants to touch the girl instead of the cat hehe #DamnYouNishikata)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Man, all the coffee. They not scared of dying of caffeine overdose- Oh. *laughs*</div></blockquote>My only comment for this episode can be summarised as "They're going to end this in one episode??", and yeah, it doesn't get any more real besides that. The new episode (11) is a wake up call. Hey, might as well be also for me <span style="font-size: xx-small;">since my project Prof is also a d*ck</span> lol, but hey, the manga author who vetted Kokonotsu's work was not wrong. It was rushed. It was not the best work. He still had time to hone his skills if he really did it. That is, if he hadn't had to run a sweets shop. That, I'd like to blame on the father. Also, the one girl he met on the streets in the middle of snow and on his way back home. Spoilers right here, but it's Hotaru-san. Why and all? Which is why I posed the question right at the start. Is this not canon story already? Or are we about to expect some plot development that may push this show in a different direction? (The latter is unlikely but still) So many questions in my mind, I hope it'll get answered soon. And soon is next week it seems, as we've literally reached a turning point which needs a conclusion. A conclusion, we may have waited for after all these years. It better be good. I hope. Maybe. *laughs*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DAy33eH4NHE/WrcO1or9cbI/AAAAAAAAmAI/oxxey-tk_-o8WdwMCB-S5tDUEXD0KAOzQCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashi_S2_11_work.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Clearly SOMEONE is not doing work.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I'll hug the sh*t out of Hotaru-san at the ending tbh- what I cannot? Actually? No one will know. OHOHOHOHO &lt;= Hotaru's laugh<br /><div><br /></div><div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Sangatsu no Lion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">LOL THE TEACHER &lt;= That's all I've got my face's the same as his</div></blockquote>This will go down as THE HAPPIEST EPISODE we'll ever get for this series, so be glad, everyone. Okay, I didn't say the new episode (42) is not sad in any way, but hey, happy can mean different things, people. After a trip to Kiriyama's high school and having one awesome of a <a href="http://jisho.org/search/nagashisoumen" target="_blank">nagashi soumen</a> "tournament" (lol) (<abbr class="imgpop"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qduo32uCORQ/WrcVsh-kZUI/AAAAAAAAmAY/Ib-ja3c_PNMXB-nrnZacF0uhrXL92WEgQCLcBGAs/s320/Nichijou10_15.jpg" /><a href="http://randomc.net/2011/06/07/nichijou-10/" target="_blank">thanks Anime "Nichijou" for the lackluster yet super memorable introduction</a></abbr>) (man, someday I gotta) Hina-chan decided to aim for that high school after the end of her middle school studies. The problem is not whether the family has enough money to finance her an education in a private school considering they sell high quality snacks at low prices, but whether she can get in in the first place lol. So yeah, Kiriyama decided to help her once again, going to her place to help her out with her schoolwork and revision for entrance exams. Man, Hina-chan you lucky girl. After this, I hoped you guys enjoyed the episode as much as I did, because you're not going to get anything happier than this. Saying that I've been waiting for such an episode after a series of sad events may just be an underestimation. But hey, I'm glad it's always the happy ending. And nearing the end we are, what will the story end on? Or is this it? I guess we'll find out in the next couple of episodes.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wF_DfjKGR7A/WrcXOlI1pPI/AAAAAAAAmAk/pyd7JrDujho1b0_MoQABEum4Ua2A2YjgQCLcBGAs/s320/sangsatsunolion42_math.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Nice chemistry", Sensei!

Here's a hint: It's the one with hairpins lol</div></blockquote>I'd like to call the final episode (12) #TheTruth but yeah, there's no truth. Let me get the gist of the story out of the place so I can do that appreciation post I do every season lol. If I were Hana-chan, and after this much, and I dreamt of that? I'll sit them down and tell them. Mainly because I'll also not have those weird dreams anymore, and also, to relieve a place in my heart. Very important for self-development, by the way. (Yes, I know this is giving place to come back with a sequel if necessary and that's how ALL Anime adaptations end, but still) Okay, everything great about this show. If the postscripts and thumbnails below are not convincing enough then I'll tell you more haha. Firstly, opening theme song. Unlike the regular ending theme song and the special one we hear this episode, this has a special place in defining what the show is, and thanks to production company Aniplex we get to be blessed with such wonderful music. It's as Anime as it can get, people. Secondly, the mood. The pace may be slow, but the mood is great. Never stops to give us an insight to everyone in the group, little stories which can matter so much you know if Eiko and the teacher walk down the alley you know something's gotta happen, and that creep behind the girls who are spying on the two lol. See? This is called "plot depth", everyone. Then, there's the reality check. Thanks to the accounts of Hana-chan and Hiroe-san mainly, the story focuses on delivering the truth to some extent, showing the struggles of being a student and especially, falling behind. Hey, it's no live-changing movie but this is good to make me tear up, so I give that a thumbs up. Lastly, everything else I missed. Not talking about girls' love, not really talking about nudity, and most definitely not talking about how much fun they have together and all the jokes that come together. If the Anime wasn't planned this way I may already have left three episodes in. If you haven't watched it this is good time to. And if you had, I hope you had much laughs (and tears) as I did. Hana-chan is the one who started it all. You can thank her for... all the stuff I'd rather you experience. That, or I can't remember all of them. Hey, that's feature-packed content right there haha<br />[SEASON END TUNA SPECIAL!! lol]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DeQIg9zW0Jg/WrchDFEdZdI/AAAAAAAAmA8/ebrwpjc44NMhxC8wdXCWZDKXPpxa5lk3ACLcBGAs/s320/slowstart12_fish.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I like how this...</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="hover"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-entertainment-news-2017-edition_12.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JZSQgp6jTJ0/Wrchgrz93RI/AAAAAAAAmBE/MDe7jCCj3u0Du-EsQxzec712XVPAN-46wCLcBGAs/s320/blends06_eye.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">... reminds me of this lol Maika [Click!]</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S.

My current obstacle probably is in the weird cast of characters typically present also in a shoujo Manga (don't ask me why), but other than that it may be worth a watch.<br /><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36470/Tada-kun_wa_Koi_wo_Shinai" target="_blank"><b>Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</b></a>: This one is interesting because I don't know of the backstory why you can't love that man.

In terms of what to watch first, for me it's likely the Otaku one and the Tada-kun one. Hmm... romance Anime this season? Sure!

The chapters (besides 118) reminisce on the turning point episode weeks ago on Kokonotsu's career options and his enthusiasm for maintaining the shop due to the useless dad who has been hospitalised since who knows when lol. That convenience store manager pops in from time to time to spy on the shop haha, and Hotaru is still a big question mark. Hey, things are picking up. I don't want to spoil too much, but the thumbnail below is not part of the Anime adaptation, so here you go:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="429" data-original-width="698" height="196" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0kOkixtdWiM/WreNF-iTfyI/AAAAAAAAmBs/fJNnAIjsBEs1sSqppxmbHknmPQqA6aG6wCLcBGAs/s320/118p8.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Once again, this is not "Rail Wars!" or some business competition Anime lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well I guess you heard of UNISON SQUARE GARDEN and RUANN last week, so I'll not bore you any further. This week, I had some time to review just two albums, and I think I got enough to talk about them already. I finally got to hear <b>Ryokushaka's 1st album</b>, and hmm... not as great as I thought. It's hard to give them songs mostly because of the keyboard tunes, I guess. Then again, the melodies in the songs are very inconsistent and are those long ones which I don't like because I think it doesn't fit in the song (exceptions do apply, but no exceptions here), and in general I would like ot hear something stronger. In emotion, mainly. The emotional songs hardly hit me, and the lively ones... I don't know. I can feel the familiarity to J-Pop, but it did not hit me tbh. Same thing with <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new album</b> after three years too, and that's saying something. Then again, I've determined this to be the last release I'm reviewing before leaving them on the edge because I've seriously not gotten used to their style considering the topic songs they have chosen. The give-birth song probably hits more mainly because of the melody, but yeah yui-san it's not much. I may just give a couple of songs though unlike Ryokushaka, and that's probably as much as I'll give them. This one also, the style of music - since it's not decided by yui - will go nowhere close to what I want anymore.<br /><br />On the bright side, <b>we know this year is still going to be good</b> with regular artist like Porno Graffitti (on preview it's okay I guess), Aqua Timez, Chatmonchy, SPECIAL OTHERS (ACOUSTIC)... so we know this year is still going to be good. Sad, huh. That only a couple of artists determine what's good about the year. Well, that's why there's Klassic Note, and I don't intend for that to happen. Yogee New Waves was pretty good with their E.P. though tbh<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of releases, namely that one song that has been in my Watch Later list in YouTube which is <b>Hayami Saori</b>-san and her new single, <b>Ajikan's best albums</b>, and <b>Cocoro Auction's new album</b>?? Hmm, I'll see about that. Meanwhile, I may be too little of a mood to listen to any of them. Well, Ajikan's will be a nostalgia trip so that'll do haha don't forget I got Apple Music<br /><br />Talking about Apple Music, next week will mark the first year I've signed in to the service. And yep, I'll still be doing it. Mainly because the resource is freely available and I still don't have a smartphone with 128GB of space lol. Anyways, it's good that more music is constantly added in to the list too, so things like that Anime "K-ON!" collection will probably keep me around.<br /><br /><br /><br />That's it, as always. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully, HOPEFULLY, I'll be done with my project report also known overseas as "final year thesis". Until next time... stay creative. The moment you go to work (if you haven't already), you'll lose all of it. Really. We don't have that much fuel to work AND play all the time. Remember: we aren't ALL that healthy. Oh that's just me? Okay I better stop here haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
