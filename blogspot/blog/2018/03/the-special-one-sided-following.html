<h2>The Special (One-Sided) Following</h2>
<div class="tr_bq">Hi. Thought I'd share a little something about idolism so here we go. No, you don't get to see this anywhere in social media. It is, once again, one of those weird (short-term) followings I decide to embark on for the sake of a certain someone. And this time, it's because of Natsukawa Shiina, or Nan-chan, as I would like to call her someday lol</div><br /><br /><br />THE BACKGROUND<br />Anyways, the story. Story goes that is it yesterday? Or a couple of days ago, she posted on her blog about strawberries. Before I get into this, let's have a little background. Nan-chan here is infamous for being the most active blogger out of the three TrySail girls considering this is one of the only avenues in the Internet that can freely share their experiences (or promote their content), and this girl, she is on it just a little more than the others. So far, I can pretty much describe her life at this point which consists of her gaming room (lol), her two younger sisters (unlike her "elder" sisters which is TrySail), buying stuff from the supermarket/convenience store and showing off her freshly cut (hair) bangs regularly. No really, I swear I can read Japanese.<br /><br />THE BLOG POST<br />Okay, now why I'm here. I refer you to <a href="https://ameblo.jp/natsukawashiinablog/entry-12356990693.html">the recent blog post</a> that she wrote, and for the sake of discussion which I shall not translate the title (she's a little weird about her life to say the least), I shall summarise the main points of the post. The image shows a bunch of strawberry-flavoured ice cream and in her recent trip to the supermarket she was in the mood to eat the much beloved berry so she started with ice cream apparently as she explains "it's the season that strawberries are tasty" lol. She then continues to describe (I won't bore myself with that) her liking to strawberries as well as ice cream (the cup one, the stick one etc.) and how they taste different from each other. She then - may I bring your attention to this - concludes with the following statement below:<br /><blockquote>イチゴ好きの同志の方も、イチゴ苦手という方も、まずはアイスで2018年のイチゴ始め。<br />いかがでしょうか。</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">"(Regardless of) Comrades who like strawberries, comrades who dislike them, start (the) strawberry (year of) 2018 with ice cream.<br />How about (that)?"</blockquote><br />And so I did:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pof4OU4Xzp8/WppF0HfPsYI/AAAAAAAAljg/42pI0SP8oFIY5JeGEZwsfQkoBVLDxOdsQCKgBGAs/s200/IMG_20180303_142530.jpg" title="LOL why did I follow her blog to post small images" width="150" /></div><br />ありがとう、ナンちゃん！<br />[Thanks, Nan-chan!]<br /><br /><br /><br />(´∀｀)ノ<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. I have eaten strawberries before tbh, despite my hate for anything vegetable and most fruits. Great ones taste sweet as heck, and terrible ones taste as bad as bad apples, literally. This one I had is average, I guess. (Audience: Why not just ice cream then?) Well, that was my decision, and I was told to stay away from cold stuff too, so this will do? *laughs*<br /><br />P.P.S. TIL a serving of strawberries is about 7~8 of them. Looks like I have two more servings to look forward to hehe<hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
