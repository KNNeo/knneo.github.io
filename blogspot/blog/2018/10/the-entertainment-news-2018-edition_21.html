<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #42</h2>
So once again, no more Anime Extra from this week onwards because... it's only Honda-san now which is a half-length show and I'm not going to open a post OR am I going to wait six days to post my review, so it'll be here. At the time it's posted, tomorrow. I know it's confusing, so I'll do it again below, yes?<br /><br />Oh yeah, the weekly post. Well technically I've done three more over the weekend, so be sure to read them all. KN10YEARS is starting this week (I'm not going to promote this thing on Twitter because it's not going to do anything spectacular anyway), and hopefully by December I can finalise my compilation lists and announce it here. Let's get this week's stuff done and over with. (Spoilers: Not for music I don't have enough time or mood to listen to new songs)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"There's nowhere for you to go" I mean, Eiji can go back to Japan just like Ash wanted. *laughs*</div></blockquote>Aw man, no sex?? But seriously, if you didn't intend to change TV channels so bad when you see Ash dancing, I want to because I am most definitely NOT GAY haha. Okay, the new episode (15) brings back Golzine (finally), lets Eiji off the bat from Lee (it's going to be the one guy in their family who in charge now so I'm not going to say his first name or whatever) and reveals that firstly, Ash is not dead. I mean, if that isn't any more obvious to any of you you're as dumb as the local media lol. So yeah, Ash is sent to the Mental Institute (which was established recently, for some reason) (2012?? I thought this story was created 20 years ago!) not to be killed of course, and if it's any surprise to you, to be experimented. By the CIA it would seem, because now that they took charge, and apparently they got rid of Golzine's role in the whole thing. Hmm, good time to do that I guess, but the old man's back and he needs to get a hold of the situation. Thankfully he's still friends with Kippard who now runs the project, so he's not totally off the hook. Ash, on the other hand, is in another predicament, as we find out more about the drug. Scientists have found out weaknesses that will eventually make recipients of the drug stupid (not joking), and to remedy that they have to test new samples on smart people like Ash I guess? Hey, we're already seen like two retards who now talk like robots, so... *laughs* Fortunately, it was just a jab... of anesthesia, and Golzine did sort of spare his life so he could see his "kid" come and take revenge on him? Haha you wish. Likely for salvation, and to remedy the current situation. Because now it's no longer only Ash vs Golzine as we continue to uncover the bigger conspiracy with the government being controlled by other private organisations? You're welcome, capitalism. So yeah, that is that. I don't want to make myself seem more complicated explaining this lol. On the other side, Eiji manages to "escape" after hearing of Ash's "death", and now is in the... care? Of Shing, that Chinese leader who was previously with Shorter. #RIPShorter but hey, this guy here is still kicking and alive. It wouldn't do much for Lee to let Eiji go, but why not? He is not of threat and "easily retrievable" (lol), so that's not going to be a problem. For now, everyone rather deal with how Ash  is making his escape, considering that this lab apparently gives public tours which is great and Max is dumb enough to introduce himself to Golzine about him writing a report on his deeds. Man, this show's got drama and makes it easy to understand haha. Ash's brain though, not that easy to comprehend to be honest. "Prodigy" may be an understatement for this 18-year-old.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOpVf7c4BA0/W8w1AhM10lI/AAAAAAAAq7w/WkRLvE1MeeUKQWsDplQmumLwbLoPN0ktgCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish15_lame.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW that guy in the cell does something funny (no sexy scenes included)</td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NAqg125V2hI/W8w0_8KpmsI/AAAAAAAAq7s/ib8aboWRo1YOhZPByG-2oQcV5CCFpDGjgCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish15_wave.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW that guy in the cell does something funny (no sexy scenes included)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Spoiler: He didn't.)<br />P.P.S. Ash's IQ is over 200? Can we get him to be President of the United States?? The current one is as if he was inserted with B1. *laughs* (Please don't kill me)<br />[OMAKE!!!

This is so wrong in so many ways I can't even</div></blockquote>Little does she know that if you leave the house that maid will ravage the shit out of the room like there's no tomorrow and make it look like normal before you even return haha. This new episode (3) actually details on why it sucks to be attractive in looks. Hey, not an everyday phenomenon even for those who put on makeup (and it's reality for me already), but you know, Misha is a good exception. But seriously, never crossed my mind when I think of why I'm never in the same school as those in international schools. Partly because of social status I believe, but yeah, blending in for most of foreign students will be rough. I mean, I would say otherwise for university but, kids are insensitive. And that can mean a lot of problems. Like for example, how our girl Misha here end up not wanting to go to school because of all the unwanted attention. And so, Tsubame tries to convince her to go to school. It worked of course, dressing up like a student and going with her which she promptly rejects (lol can't you disguise yourself as the teacher?) making her think that she should go to school herself to avoid the nightmare that is the maid lol. And so she did. (We will not talk about what happened to Tsubame when she HAD to monitor the kid in school) And it turns out, it wasn't that bad. I mean, because there's something worse than her not going to school haha. Okay, story goes that she and another girl take care of a couple of hamsters in class (and that's why you don't buy one male one female) who to be honest is best character this episode because not only did she not blame Misha on her absence but also helped her with schoolwork... Okay, back to the hamsters. Because mainly due to the teacher who thought taking care of one hamster cage is easier than two, it quickly became a disaster since the two hamsters were having it off like rabbits. *laughs* So yeah, Misha took it to her hands to resolve the issue and - of course with the help of other classmates - perhaps make things a lot better for the class. And this, is how you make an impression, kids. Don't be an emo kid; be proactive. And that's what Misha should be: a girl who can stand on her own, instead of mourning over her mother's passing. The father is right though: It takes time for her to forget about it before he can try to convince her to lead a normal life, but hey, the maid did kind of do it through negative encouragment so that's good haha. Honestly this show is great. Just... ignore the pecs and her stealth skills in the toilet lol she hid UNDER the stairs wtf<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TANhwfS9AM4/W8w-UvplM3I/AAAAAAAAq8A/wdaFYlTfgA0r26MQfMH7nXYPQjOxyO8IACLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru03_misha.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center; height: 32px; vertical-align: text-top;">MFW I realised I said something contradictory haha<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-84jc2C0GYLY/W8w-Um-ZkCI/AAAAAAAAq8E/nkgs11UYZrcTy4fDuGwN48eY4gi-aVvTwCLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru03_naive.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center; height: 32px; vertical-align: text-top;">MFW I realised I said something contradictory<br />and no one else found out because they're dumb lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

"We're out!" "Then why are you here!" Haha #SoTrue</div></blockquote>To answer your first question, Honda-san? Yes I have seen people in suits come into otaku bookstores you should watch Wotakoi haha oh they are not customers? Okay, the new episode (3) has practically made Honda-san break his shoulders. And again, it's with customers. But first, not customers. They are called salespersons, however they do not sell directly to consumers but to bookstores. And with heavy changes in supply and demand (even if demand is just the one guy who bought 200 copies) this can be either a wonderful meeting or the worst encounters in the day of a bookstore staff ever. From running out of stock or screwed up orders to trying not to accept too much novelty they cannot afford to stuff as decor for the store, there's always something to worry about. Then, there's customer trivia. Because people are often lost when they want to find new stuff to read, it's hard for any of the staff to come up with some good recommendation off their minds. So, they pop open that staff room door and ask the others. And when you thought trivia games were fun, wait till you can come up with something better than these guys the moment that one French guy had pretty much no clue to give you and he wants to buy something for the granddaughter. I mean, Honda-san did pull it off in the end so that's good. That and probabky his shoulders too I would think lol <div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LWCiIzqqVIw/W83HHt98X_I/AAAAAAAAq9w/BO5-wh3IDfUrJLBegKNu-e6mYdcS7RwWwCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan03_trample.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That's me down there when I think how colleagues will treat me if I interrupt them</td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GeJYR1Rnzlk/W83HIN6kjiI/AAAAAAAAq98/Ym9ihB68vkM7sEohGnIpPTdLqMUfViwHACPcBGAYYCw/s320/hondasan03_accept.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Lol didn't even notice the words were the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%81%86%E3%81%91%E3%81%A8%E3%82%8B">same</a> <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%82%E3%82%89%E3%81%86">thing</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

They aren't all that impressive to give off the bat! But yes I did listen to a couple of releases this week. <b>ORESKABAND's new song</b> was okay, and still better than that other band I'd rather not talk about now because I rejected their digital singles two times now (it's Yogee New Waves), so I might just give it. Who knows when these girls are going to come up with something soon, and I'd rather not wait. <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>SIXLOUNGE's new mini-album</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/venus-ep/1436939553?app=music"></iframe></span></div> wasn't impressive to be honest, and even their topic song turns out going in from one ear and out of the other. I did mark one song though so I'll see if I can give that or not. <b>Kuraki Mai's concept album</b> was still in the questionable area as said from last week, so I'll need time to give them. *sigh* No new songs already?<br /><br />Talking about new songs, <b>the theme songs for that maid Anime</b> above are going to be released. Yeah, I have to give one of them. Ugh. I just hope the opening theme isn't a disappointment because there is NO FREAKING WAY I'll give the ending haha<br /><br />In Twitter news, hey didn't notice <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Minase Inori is in Apple Music</b></span><span class="pop"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey guess who showed up on Apple Music this week.
