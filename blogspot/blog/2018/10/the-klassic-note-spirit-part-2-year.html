<h2>The Klassic Note Spirit Part 2 – The Year 2008 and the Culture of Initiation</h2>
<style>    .thumbnail .hover {   display:none; } .thumbnail:hover .normal {   display:none; } .thumbnail:hover .hover {   display:inline;  /* CHANGE IF FOR BLOCK ELEMENTS */ } </style>Welcome back. Previously we talked about how Klassic Note started and mainly where and how all this listening to Japanese music even came about, living in a place without such music culture. In this part, we talk about how my enthusiasm continues to power the amount of songs I listen to and want to listen to, bringing upon more joy as I immerse in their music culture.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">The Klassic Note Spirit Part 2</span><br />"The Year 2008 and the Culture of Initiation"</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">(*The below information is an adaptation of the original excerpt which was posted <a href="http://knwebreports2012.blogspot.com/2013/11/wednesday-night-report-klassic-note.html">here</a> in 2013)</span></div><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I suppose here's where everything really started rolling: The introduction of Anime theme songs and its unique style drew me into this world I know of as "J-Pop". And yes, I - at that time - am enjoying it. It should be the time that I felt the most of (it)…"</blockquote><br /><br />THE DEDICATION TO SEARCHING<br />Many thanks should be given to the artists I dedicate many hours to find out their other songs from their debut till date, which include solo artists like YUI and bands like Aqua Timez and Ikimono-gakari. Many songs at that time came in to make me touched hit me in a different way I felt from Chinese songs which are mostly emotional and mostly tied to love. And it is that difference, I guess is how they attracted me to listen to them. These made me end up with above 100 songs by the end of the year, compared to the handful of songs I listen just a couple of years ago.&nbsp;Let's take for example, Aqua Timez. The unique long string of lyrics I don’t hear anywhere else (normally it’s too long that it became rap) actually are strings of meaningful words with the aid of several fan-subtitled (also called "fansub") groups to let me understand the lyrics, bringing understanding to the scenery and worldview they were presenting. Back then I may not have understood the songs that much, but it does not matter. The melodic tunes are truly what attracted me.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"They (My parents) ask why I like to listen to songs 'that no one understands', but I tell them I'm 'listening to the melodies instead of the lyrics'."</blockquote><br /><br />THE INFLUENCE OF <blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>Additionally, the influence of Anime has not stopped in providing me with fresh new melodies especially from artists that I don’t know of, and that maybe on their road to debut release or just a long-run veteran in the industry. This is so much so to the extent that I actually watch Anime just to listen to the theme songs (two typically in a series, opening and ending) or even just give the song a listen and dumping the show entirely because I like the music more than the Anime itself. Bands like THYME and VELTPUNCH are great examples of such a trend, ignoring shows like "Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto -Natsu no Sora" and "Nabari no Ou" which were probably popular back in 2008.<br /><br />THYME:<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqcUD2eNOzA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"></iframe></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Cool girl isn’t it?

One of the artists responsible for the expansion of Klassic Note and the search is above: a 90s debut alternative rock known as VELTPUNCH. Their music style is so uniquely appealing it makes me have a desire for more like you'd never believe. Along with bands like ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION (Ajikan) and Chatmonchy, they bring the best and special of the genre that is Japanese Rock music. With Ajikan and their own compilation, THE NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION which consists of Japanese rock and English rock artists and their featured tunes with live tours featuring those artists, help bring along the best and amazing styles of Rock music I've heard so far.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Among all the stress, J-Rock truly made me 'high' and 'emo' (emotional) and forget about all the stress in school that time."</blockquote><br /><br />HOW DID INSTRUMENTALS?<br />And it’s not only songs that made me interested, because back then there was instrumental and J-Rock group "SPECIAL OTHERS" who are so special and different from others - hidden in the NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION as mentioned above - who started me on a journey to listening to instrumental music from Japan instead of songs with vocals, even though before that I was just listening to piano instrumentals or even classical music. That didn't have a language unlike singing Japanese, and that I have nothing to judge on besides the beats. And back then I can't believe how good they were and how happy I was, joining the fans in listening to their live video performances; Looking at them already makes you feel the beat and want me to go join in their live someday.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x11ebzl"></iframe><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>That’s all I guess. There’s definitely more from other artists from various other shows I watched, from Anime "Nagasarete Airantou" featuring voice actress and solo artist Horie Yui (you guys should know her as you probably watched a show from this veteran at some point) to Anime "Shakugan no Shana" featuring Anime artist Kawada Mami (artists signed exclusively to Anime music labels) in the theme songs. These artists go a long way to define the unique melodies in Klassic Note that is from J-Pop and J-Rock and many, many more.<br /><br /><br />Next up: <a href="https://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-klassic-note-spirit-part-3-year.html">The Klassic Note Spirit Part 3 – The Year 2009 and the Big Bang</a><br />(The Anime-watching and artist-searching continues to make impact…)<br /><br /><br /><hr />(**All linked references ago were active at time of publishing this post.
