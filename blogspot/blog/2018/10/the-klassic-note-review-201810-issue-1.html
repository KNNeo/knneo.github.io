<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2018.10 Issue 1</h2>
Hi guys. I said it'll be soon, but I took my time because my weekends are precious so here we are lol<br /><br />On the other hand I'm here to review another one of those single-track releases so if you would excuse me I'd like to finish this quick. Thank goodness they are all good, otherwise I'll not do it already haha. This one is from an Anime "BANANA FISH" which I must say is pretty good and popular, so you guys should go check it out. Their theme songs are dope by the way (*Accurate as of first cour)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />King Gnu - Prayer X [Single]<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img height="320" src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/53/75/15/537515bd-0d4d-586e-1b7d-5acb8b94aa8f/jacket_XSXX00447B01A_550.jpg/626x0w.jpg" style="user-select: none;" width="311" /></div>(Interesting artwork, I must say. It'll leave an impression, to say the least)<br /><br />Origin: I know little of this band, to be honest. But if I knew them earlier, I may be interested. Dipping into Alternative music genres, King Gnu is somewhat special in their expression with quite a lot of Rap, some Rock, but none unlike this one. Thanks to Anime "BANANA FISH" I'd like to believe the band set out to make an impression showing the grim mood of the series, and that immediately left an impression. Fast forward a month after its digital release, and a disced copy was released I guess due to its popularity. It sure was unexpected, but since it's Klassic Note I have to give them, and here we are.<br /><br />(1) Prayer X<br />From intro:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Like the tears that flow out and shining for (that) moment, as if that was life</div><div style="text-align: center;">(With) encounters and farewells repeating in the days (we live in), what in the world should (we) believe in?"</div></blockquote>And yes, this is describing a song of conspiracy. A lack of trust, and in general what is the Anime it was represented all about. Dark in theme, but the melody is sound, and it did catch my attention at first listen even at the preview. The overall song was short which was good for making it impressive, so I thank them for that. The lyrics above repeat throughout the song, so if you wondered what it felt like, there you go. They also went a little further to describe the killings and surviving in the dark world in general, but that I shall not dwelve futrher. To know that this was a melody to remember, with a unique pop style and memorable lyrics, this makes of a perfect song to like.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a good single. Of course, I'm giving it credit because it's a single-track release, but this one stands out on its own to be recommended, to be honest. The acoustic track (though short) stands to make you like the song more, and I would say if you liked this style this release is a must-have in order to remember their feat for producing music for Anime. You have my respect, King Gnu; This was impressive for a song.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PDSIqv9fXyY/W8wpkvsnzpI/AAAAAAAAq68/cPYDOPCJqVYC04lwvXh2Ni0_dQviQj5UQCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181021_145105.jpg" width="320" /></div>Because of a certain thing I mentioned in the review earlier, you might have guessed this might be a haphazard production. In their news feed there wasn't an expected disced release which was why I gave the digital single when it was out in August. But come one month later was this, and if not for the Anime's Twitter account promoting this, I wouldn't have known. But hey, I'll do it. It's for Klassic Note anyways. But, I didn't expect a glorious release package. And I wasn't wrong.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NOgUQPw56BM/W8wp5Z0oQ6I/AAAAAAAAq7I/LltiI1Hs1oE0H4-JhVEAm77_KzZQirhvwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181021_145207.jpg" width="320" /></div>As you can see inside, those light blue bars are either done by an intern to make sure we can see the lyrics or they just are rushing for release. I can see the lyrics though, but man did they not bother to make it look good. From custom font to making it look like the red font around it would be easy solutions but I do not want to further comment. This must be by far the most disappointing single release ever in Klassic Note. Okay, Earphone's slip case for a single may be below that, but this one is close second. Also, it used wrapping instead of plastic packagaing so I had to put on one of my own so it can look good standing on its own. Ugh. *laughs*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QEGe69Izxeo/W8wrc8mdgcI/AAAAAAAAq7Y/AHWoe1RT0UALkFaHuyyq9qrJftX9FTnAwCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181021_150135.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Klassic Note Review 2018 so far.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then.
