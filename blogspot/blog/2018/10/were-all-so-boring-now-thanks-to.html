<p dir="ltr"><b>We're all so boring now thanks to globalisation.</b> Thanks, Internet.</p><p dir="ltr">Hey, don't kill me there, modern society. Allow me to explain. You guys know of the good times. The times we felt like the world was barely just the nation and not much more. The times where there was nothing else for entertainment or even conversation than life in here itself. Today, thanks to the Internet, we can have an array of interests, and what makes us desire more is what will distance us from each other. And make us not be able to converse with our colleagues because just one word will give us as many Google search answers as there are the amount of them in the category, for example video games.</p><p dir="ltr">I miss the nineties. I lived it before, by the way, just the end of it though. Even then, it was great times.</p><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
