<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #20</h2>
<style>    </style>Hi. I can confidently say (since Tuesday haha) that I'm happy again. Well, not until I have to see the results. Haha why do I have to make jokes on myself<br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal">See? I'm in such a mood that I'm playing with so much CSS now lol notice how short this post is? I'm trying an incentive-based blog post where if you click on each paragraph from now on you'll get the next haha yeah it's going to be like that now<br /><br /></span><span class="hover">See? I'm in such a mood that I'm playing with so much CSS now&nbsp;lol notice how short this post is?&nbsp;I'm trying an incentive-based blog post&nbsp;where if you click on each paragraph from now on you'll get the next haha yeah it's going to be like that now<br /><br />Nah just joking it's just for this week I'm not that free to do so much inline code I don't intend to create a template of and also it's adding a lot of extra text haha okay now that you know the secret go ahead and continue reading I may monetize this if this method works lol<br /></span><br /><span class="hover"><br /></span><span class="hover">Oh well I can't make it work I have too many stacking CSS divs lol let's move on</span></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote>Okay this new episode (6) is nothing short of lame, but at least the upside is its self-awareness lol. A girl stands by a railroad crossing (as per the plot) and an old man pokes his face on a nearby patch of grass beside a shrine under the crossing. (Yes Japanese build shrines anywhere where there is presence of God) He was too embarrassed to come out because apparently he got drunk the night before, fell into the area and is without pants. So yeah, self aware. So at this point of daylight he has only this girl to ask for help (I mean, the first person he can ask) but yeah, it's kind of tough. Despite all the help she got from the girl who probably has anything but some level of clothing for him to hide his crotch so he can go home, he still thanks her with an orange he accidentally got after his predicament. And... I can't talk any further because it's a word pun none of us will understand. And it's not even funny lol. Anyways, I just like how aware is the old man about how embarrassed he will be without his bottoms (I mean, look at other Anime for a comparison) and he technically does not stick out as a pervert even though he is in a situation that will make him sound like one lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-008Yi7E7vy0/WwExpHtJ8-I/AAAAAAAAm5M/yp2CRrJWrqA07mi0nVms5o0yFa-UXG6mQCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan06_shock.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I don't need to do a reaction video for this episode I just screengrab lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Not going to do the word pun explanation because I think it's lame and I don't really understand it myself anyway haha<br /><br /><span class="hover"></span><span class="hover"></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="hover"><span style="font-size: large;">Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="hover">Nyanko Big didn't come home at all? He probably was at the salon dating that female cat lmao</span></div></blockquote>So wait, what? Is that a yes or a no, Yamashita?? Haha in the new episode (7) it's another character focus episode, and no it's not Nyanko Big we got over that already and I'm totally correct that it has got to do with that cat he got interested in, but it's an episode about Yui-chan. Remember? That Tada-kun's sister which we wished we all had? (Okay, personally I'd much prefer <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/156094/Yui_Tada">the voice actress</a> behind it hehe) Yeah, it's her turn to <strike>be played by production</strike> have a chance to experience love for herself. And what more better way to do this then through her favourite medium, books? Well, specifically, through her favourite detective series... I don't know the name, but yeah, featuring that woman that the Twitter account had to <a href="https://twitter.com/tadakoi_anime/status/995083684775522304">promote the cast on</a> lol. (Ooo she's <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/22849/Masaki_Kurosaki">Ichigo's mother</a>) Anyways, the episode talks physically about the missing of Nyanko Big who desperately is trying to win over the cat whose owner is from the salon, but spiritually it's about Yui-chan trying to get over her love for Yamashita, that junior of Tada-kun who behaves like a dog okay that's not the point. The point is... infatuation, I suppose. But again, what is wrong with that? Then again, at this point both share similar points like it's only surface level in romance so yeah, you can technically still stand outside the house every day until she goes out with you haha yeah I'm talking about the cat. But yeah, in a similar way, Yui-chan can still...? Hmm I'll leave that for you guys to figure out. Then again, they haven't really made much progression on the Tada x Teresa stuff, so yeah, no plot progression I suppose. Another thing; I also felt the episode got a bit lost (like how they without Charles are searching for the cat lol) on trying to connect this with everyone's understanding of romance. The cat's story is fine, but also putting Yui-chan into the situation... maybe because there isn't much context between Yamashita and Yui that makes it feel less substantial compared to the others who technically have been together experiencing things and stuff come on Pin-senpai is already going out with his gravure idol- uh, I mean, that class chairwoman already for some reason. Still, the ending kind of ties the story together for Nyanko Big, and for Charles particularly as we finally got a glimpse of what seems to be his time with Teresa in the past. Hmm... things need to get more interesting quick I'm getting impatient haha<br /><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDDbE8bFrwQ/WwE6RkHyVBI/AAAAAAAAm5Y/buk4zAOQRjwrC2chJ8Gvky0KT3ArUV-zACLcBGAs/s320/tadakun07_detective.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">EXPECTATION</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wmsH96mFxGc/WwE6SwKI6WI/AAAAAAAAm5c/G515FOEN0VU1jIAGVWKOsp9RY_SKr5r9wCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun07_pose.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">REALITY<br />(lol Yui-chan you so cute)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. Once again taking some time to remind you kids not to punch your grandparents in the gut because we have to respect elders, yes? *looks at Yui* Also, it's THE THIRD TIME you mention of that quote already I've gotten bored of it already you NERD haha<br />P.P.S. Also, another thing that substantiates my doubt on storytelling this episode: Remember the slideshow you watched when Yui emphasised how important the cat was when it went missing? Yeah, lack of previous context. If previous context were heavier this wouldn't even be necessary. As expected of original Anime haha oh well<br />(Yui-chan can be my feather teaser anytime haha what?? Here's a GIF btw)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A4dLyvcslGs/WwE7STBuGZI/AAAAAAAAm5o/pzGpsqk1z74q1b6eZwttkdwmujRT_si5ACLcBGAs/s1600/tadakun07_catnip.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Meow" xD</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Yep, I most definitely went back to hear Nifuji impersonate Momose once more lmao</div></blockquote>I swear once you know the reason why Narumi-chan is sad about you'll change perspectives immediately because I did lol. Okay the new episode (6) is again separated into two segments, so let's talk about them. Firstly, everything that is the text above. Momose Narumi-chan is sad for some reason because she's acting normal?? Haha okay that because it's that in the manga she reads... (MAJOR SPOILERS) her favourite character died. Yeah. That's it. *laughs* Okay moving on~ (No seriously I didn't cry because someone died... okay technically I don't watch many shows with people dying so...) (Audience: Not even action shows?) (I mean, do people die in BLEACH? Okay yeah there's the old man but still it's not something to be sad about) Second half of the episode talks about Christmas and... it's kind of working out for Koyanagi and Kabakura because the guy just gets busy at the time of year and the girl... she's prepared for cosplaying (at winter Comiket which happens right after Christmas, if you are wondering) so all is well? I mean, of course it's not. Dating man, it's not about getting that limited edition Anime figure (okay maybe it is) it's about the two having a good time together. So yeah, the guy gentlemanly finishes his work so he can have one lovely dinner with his girlfriend. Good job, bro. On the other hand, we get to hear kids stories of Santa Claus and how Nao doesn't seem to have gotten laid yet. I mean, not like we know of lol. Anyways, wonderful episode actually compared to the past few tbh, and sorry if the stories aren't as interesting as you thought it will be. I mean, my house don't even care about Christmas, mind you.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a68VCJQCoWI/WwFECoOhPvI/AAAAAAAAm50/Wg2coK-MLAw27lJ-tsZtOKN_MXzVeIEEQCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi07_kabakura.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The kind of happiness I want to be in seriously I'm so jealous of Kabakura</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-194FuFLvTrQ/WwFEJqaqXeI/AAAAAAAAm54/Cutpg5nvrG0-8DFeEKwzkRzrApebhp0agCLcBGAs/s320/wotakoi07_lift.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#anime_irl</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. To clarify that word pun on the coffee scene, "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/taihen">taihen</a>" just means hard in this context working outside the cafe in the snow but Narumi is phrasing it as realistic (read as "<a href="https://jisho.org/word/%E8%BF%AB%E7%9C%9F">hakushin</a>") (okay maybe I'm just dumb because I can't break it down or she's just trying to make a joke here) because of how sadly Nao as a worker as to stare at couples considering he doesn't have a partner lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Nagasarete Airantou</span></div></blockquote>Eh... do we know those aliens?? Man, I cannot remember stuff. The new chapter (160) gives us the answer to the long pondered question of who is the actual Lord of the South before Suzu-chan's sensei and that is... a bunch of aliens! I mean, why not, right? Funny they can get out of the island but these people can't lol. Anyways, it's not about that. A bigger thing is that this was actually due to an accident, I assume. Then again, aliens have been inhabiting this island? Since when? I have a feeling I've seen this part before but I don't recall. But then again, it's probably just to round the story up. So yeah, an alien saved the Lord at the right time in the past, and left his mantle there accidentally even though he clearly stated it was also to send a message to protect the forest. (I mean, seriously? You don't even live here) Oh well, mystery solved, ladies and gentlemen. Now I can sleep tight knowing that I just enjoyed a bunch of ecchi-related teases on Misaki and Suzu-chan haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="413" data-original-width="483" height="273" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZwjElnAy9fQ/WwGDxchetwI/AAAAAAAAm6I/gCEvUd7HtqsoH9nnaN7cPeRSDTjw0Ny2ACLcBGAs/s320/160-126.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#foreshadowing haha no it's just an alien lol</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>Well... for this new chapter (127) it's just literally the last part of the last episode of season 2 of the Anime, but just done in the park instead of in the shop. Yeah. That's it. I'm done. Well, in the Anime they did not explain many things, so from next chapter hopefully all will be explained. Or unless a season 3 Anime comes first lol no it won't they can't find enough sponsors for this<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="430" data-original-width="654" height="210" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2xI-dfBnF5o/WwGFcG0rbZI/AAAAAAAAm6U/ozLIdJB2I3IS1-ENdlwD6J3pKkw55OJFACLcBGAs/s320/127-d6.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"I want to have sex with you" haha you wish *laughs*</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Koufuku Graffiti</span></div></blockquote>The "new" chapter (10) talks about the sports fest. Well, we don't even need to guess but Kirin's the sporty one while Ryou... let's just say she's still alive after this event lol. (I mean, I don't even want to talk about Shiina haha) But yeah, since food is the topic for this story, of course they had to do bentos. The school will make sure catering is NOT available for the event haha. So yeah, Kirin got to do a lunch box for Ryou. Was it great? I mean, the face says it all. Man, now I want to have some of it myself. Oh yeah, I should be having supper now haha YAY FREEDOM OF HUNGER haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="314" data-original-width="430" height="233" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iaMgA4eqQAY/WwGH24aRZNI/AAAAAAAAm6g/TBb_oZpIsB4Y7qeObHNBgH5NFdmmzfbWwCLcBGAs/s320/10-8.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If I have to show you the next frame I'll have to mature rating this blog haha</td></tr></tbody></table><hr />(I am seriously considering just thumbnails if there isn't much to talk about because you know, one chapter)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week was hectic in Klassic Note mostly because of the alleviation (lol) but also because mostly because amongst all this I'm also reviewing that <b>SPECIAL OTHERS ACOUSTIC new album</b> which was... well first things first there's two self cover pieces so be sure to listen to them because I know of them and the rest.... I didn't give a lot I guess because I totally miss their former style I just hope this is not going to be the norm I know they're getting old but I love them drums so please keep that on instead haha. Okay, now with the long sentences away, I would like to say expect <b>two single reviews</b> next week but firstly it's only one (the other is I forgot to get for my shelf) and then the delivery got delayed because I'm dumb enough to use a referral service for some reason haha so we shall see how that goes next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, we finally welcome a couple of anticipated releases for Anime. <b>Ooishi Masayoshi's new single</b> for Anime "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai" will come out next week and man has it been a wait. I just hope the rest of the song isn't disappointing I want to put this as top 20 if possible. Also coming out is <b>Minase Inori's 2nd album</b> but going by the previews I've heard so far I may not be giving many. But then again I'm refraining from listening to more previews so I can get some full song impressions so... maybe?<br /><br />In recent Twitter news, I didn't know <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES and SECONDWALL are releasing full albums</b> at the start of next month so that's good news. Both have a good impression on Klassic Note and I can't wait to give more. <b>Amamiya Sora is releasing her 2nd album</b> in July, <b>Kuso Iinkai is finally releasing a new single</b> after their album which is like a year ago, and <b>Minase Inori sang a commercial song</b> about a lemon soda drink and as usual <a href="https://youtu.be/Xo2dIv0dkOY">the music video</a> stands out WAY more than the song for some reason haha idolism everyone<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done. In between playing games (Ugh screw you DOAXVV event) and experimenting with CSS (when I don't even know how) I'm tired after a long day outside the house. Well, it was visiting my aunt's new house since the death of half her family (well there's still her daughter) (and they live in an codomunium now ie. private apartment) but still there's complication I don't want to bother you about. Maybe you guys should get worried if I will spam more posts over the next few weeks because finally I have time for <b>#KN10YEARS</b> and I swear if I'm not going to publicise the heck out of it at least I will finish it. Same thing as 5th year though and in case no one knows what happened I'll just announce some compilation releases, talk about the past 5 years, and the future of Klassic Note. As of now... really bleak lol. Anyways cya guys then my enthusiasm for this is going to wear off lol. Until next time... may I bless myself more energy and time to do this AND play the games I want all day haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
