<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #16</h2>
*sigh*<br /><br />I think I'm doomed. My final year project/thesis/whatever you call that project which ends your university/college final year. Oh well, I blame myself for submitting to peer pressure in choosing a professor and project early. I think I would have gotten an easier life if I were to be chosen somehow. My luck on extremely important events has been rather good anyways.<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />I think I'll blame myself on this, Prof. It's not your fault for saying that I'm dealing with "trash" and "didn't have anything to show off". You don't like experimentation-based projects, I guess.<br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />Okay, I'm done. Remove ALL that negative feelings away, for we got some Anime to watch! <span style="font-size: xx-small;">(Actually was totally wanting to watch this on Friday immediately after the last of Anime to air this week but I also had to meet for a demo on Friday, you know)</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote>If you've only heard the word "eroi" for the whole video, you're not alone. The new episode (2) talks about women. Sorry, ladies. But yeah, it's a classmate thing again. But this time, it's one of the guys against one of the hottest female classmates in class. Well, if you're staring at her the wrong way no one will blame you I guess, but yeah, I guess the overemphasis of this is kind of irritating haha. Nonetheless, it's entertaining as heck, and yeah they do make your wish come true (in Anime) by giving some form of interaction where... Majima-san? (Sorry only heard the one word lol) Yeah, she does up your tie. Well that's kind of cliche of a plot, but hey, he got laid. Well, about the amount of time the train passes only though, as he stays stunned by her beauty. But hey, a little background will make sense but no follow-ups will likely make this anti-climactic, because this is likely what we'll get. No seriously, this it it. Now go fap in a corner if you need to lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-W6Qg0Md3SdI/WtvsFhL1Y0I/AAAAAAAAmjQ/0svCvyJBz_gu6Iqdc3h-busEF_QRVD24gCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan02_shock.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I don't ****** as dramatically as this kid does lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. WHAT IS WITH THE VOICE OF THE GIRL??? No really, REALLY weird. It was as if I was hearing from a mature voice somehow... Oh it's the girl who sang the theme song. Oh.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">If I can have a younger sister in life, it'd better be Yui-chan, yes? Come on she has a bright pink schoolbag... <span title="*giggles*">ðŸ¤­</span></div></blockquote>And hey Yui-chan isn't the only thing that shines so much it's brighter than everyone else. Right, Alec-san? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> The new episode (3) is literally a whole episode from the cat's perspective (thanks production!!) (also, voiced by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/146/Akio_Ootsuka" target="_blank">this guy</a> as I found out because I find familiarity in&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/148469/Zouroku_Kashimura" target="_blank">his</a> <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/1088/Jirou_Souzousuke_Shunsui_Kyouraku" target="_blank">voice</a>), and boy did it bring up a different view. Well, at least, where the topic of love is concerned. I mean, it fell in love lol. Okay, the plot. It shows another lovely day of Tada-kun's life with Teresa-chan, and after a morning coffee the guys so on a photo shoot to try to nail that competition prize, I guess. Sounds short, but many things happened which focus on the details on what happened but in the perspective of the cat. Interactions may be right or wrong (the old man nailed it though), but all in all very entertaining to watch as it explains the many reasons for the cat's reactions for the first couple of episodes, from hating Ijuin to how it got fat lol. Also, we got quite a flashback as to how Teresa-chan... got disciplines to behave herself and not act abruptly because she is- Well you know haha. (Also, I don't care about Ijuin's backstory haha) All in all, another wonderful episode to watch, and I shouldn't spoil too much on this, but yeah since "Tada-kun won't fall in love" you would expect the affection to come from somewhere, yes? Looking at you, Teresa-chan hehe (oh also spoilers below so if you haven't watched) oh also Alec-san very interesting girl as we have found out (remember the secondary character development thing?)<br />[NYANKO BIG MONTAGE!! Haha what do you think will be in the thumbnail(s)?]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dfpvo8S5Da4/Wtv0y48_riI/AAAAAAAAmj4/KUxhewXjfW4E_WGrJzMZxrCKUhr2Ch1rwCLcBGAs/s320/tadakun03_nyanko1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your mom thought you love her terrible cooking lol</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHc7i9HxHYc/Wtv0zA522bI/AAAAAAAAmj8/2pce_3plcM0SgqMJy6A9ZnmqcuM7AeyaACLcBGAs/s320/tadakun03_nyanko4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When your best friend knows you going out to buy porn lol</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. I thought it'll be a good joke that Teresa-chan will switch hands just to avoid an indirect kiss from a coffee cup oh this isn't Wotakoi?? Oops haha but hey the cat knows what's up<br />P.P.S. "If a man and a woman stare at each other for..." And I'm like "BRING THAT COUNTER UP" and it didn't happen. Hey, it's only episode 3, guys. Gotta have a little more patience lol "If a woman stares at her cup for more than 8 seconds..." <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />(Okay last one: "It's not that sweet" followed by Tada-kun's voice reminded me of a certain Anime episode titled "Life is not that easy" - winners who know where this episode comes from will get a prize of knowing why. <a href="https://doax-venusvacation.jp/" target="_blank">the freemium game in DMM</a> (don't say yes to the mature content warning and you'll still find this) because they've been putting ads on their new character Tamaki (voiced by the lovely, lovely Oonishi Saori) (yeah, and the character's sadistic too hehe) but I've not gotten my hands (literally) on her though. It's hard to even play the game considering I'm reading a bunch of Japanese text and got an inventory of swimsuits and accessories enough to stuff my sling bag lol. (Ah then again it's swimsuits, so... lol broke my joke) Well, I'm going back to look at swinging babes, if you'll excuse me. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I'm still not that pleased on the 3D graphics of today though because clearly there's still a certain level of conflict in graphics when they swing their hair, put their hands on the table with a cloth for example, and so on. Don't ask me why, I just think it's still unnatural. Half the reason why I'm not into these games yet. Well, I won't say that now though gotta go back and swing those tit-<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
