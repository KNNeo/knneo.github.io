<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #44</h2>
Well I'm tired after sleeping for an afternoon so let's finish this quick, yes? (Audience: What?) Yeah, and if you can't sleep and want to read more of my spelling mistakes thank goodness I did not forget the two new posts for The Klassic Note Spirit this week. I really need to finish the last few ones up before my posting catches up with my effort to complete the series lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">BANANA FISH</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It hurts to not be told the truth" Hey, you're not wrong Eiji. How many people in this world will know?</div></blockquote>Sounds like fair trade when you say "I'll kill your enemies and you'll kill mine", isn't it, Lee? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, the new episode (17) did not feature Ash's confrontation with Lee - oh no, not yet - but brings us a new guy to do a nostalgia talk. But before that, things. Following last week's escape from the hellhole, Ash manages to reunite with Eiji and the gang, and that's good news, to say the least. The two have a good time (read the postscript for details lol), and continue to find out what the true identity of Banana Fish is. Meanwhile, that Lee (the one who will only be alive once all this is done) took himself to strike a deal with Golzine. So, a trade serial murder of sorts, I would say. Golzine helps to get rid of his family not including him because then what's the point (haha), and he offers everything he knows of the situation to him, including how to get Ash back. And that, if you needed more hints, is to actually freak the sh*t out of his primal instincts which he has been trained for. To complete the equation, Golzine got back his old friend Blanca, who also, if you need more hints, probably taught Ash the ways of killing. Hey, sounds familiar? You know, every genius killer needs a mentor, so I guess this man is it. He stalked the shit out of Ash, went from retired and rejected off Golzine's offer to accepting the challenge, killed the crap out of the man who Ash is trying to interrogate posing as a prostitute (it's a long story lol) from a building like, halfway across the cityscape... Guys, we have a new contender. Golzine may be old, but this Blanca guy is quite above the crazy level compared to Ash and the old man, and that probably has got him worried. Can't wait till their eyes meet and someone has to die lol I wonder who maybe Eiji? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xBiKS0mSjR0/W95jEg588EI/AAAAAAAArN0/CXwP04vyrTggj59dFbFsz7W9XSD7iOJiACLcBGAs/s320/bananafish17_hug.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This series in a nutshell</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fhCBey8i4iU/W95jEybCpBI/AAAAAAAArN4/_Ioyc5oDISAgJmCxrqYdMn6SBcvMJoIWQCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish17_stare.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This series in a nutshell</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. The worst thing this series has given us is (the insinuation of) gay sex. There, I said it. You guys know I'm straight, right? "Not gay"?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />P.P.S. Applauding Ash's intelligence for figuring out so far what Banana Fish is made out of as he pointed out the chemicals likely to be in the drug, while Lee tells us the facts really makes Ash real close to finding out the truth. All but never knowing it, which is pretty impressive for someone his age. Also, Lee was smart to assassinate all people blocking Golzine's path by keeping his plan to "only kill where Ash approaches them" and that is as clean as it is smart how long did they think of this, the author? lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Uchi no Maid ga Uzasugiru!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"What does it mean to be cute?" Oh Misha-chan you will never know you f**king brat-</div></blockquote>Okay NOW I believe the maid will be of some use because if under threat we can send this ex-servicewoman to the rescue haha you poor girl. Wow it's only just halfway through this series and this episode (5) is already introducing us to another irritating person haha. Well, Misha-chan is cute so naturally they have to talk about this, but yeah, the girls in class (who think they are cute) are getting jealous of the Russian chick lol. Specifically, Morikawa. I mean, it's nothing wrong, but hey, it's irritating to try to be cute and there's the one person who can do it effortlessly? (Sorry to all girls in the entertainment industry haha) I mean, she does not have that experience, and so Morikawa decides to challenge Misha. To what? To... getting an outfit on the streets within an hour which will make them cuter? I have a feeling I've seen this before lol. It just ended up being a storytelling of Tsubame to Morikawa about war haha. That, and Tsubame just got her first discipline lmao. Well, give the kid some money would you, parents? Then again, she may have spent too much just to stand out on the streets. She kind of did though but not compared to that pure blonde hair hehe (#NotLolicon). And then, there's the sports festival. Besides drinking too much iced coffee (lol why), the kids get to fight for... I don't know what, but hey, it's a school thing. That, and many things happened that ended up involving Tsubame as the replacement for Morikawa who was supposed to be the OP (overpowered) one in the class, now became too OP because this is elementary school and there's an adult on the field lol (Totally reminds me of that <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji" target="_blank">one kid with the butler</a> reminding him to not stand out too). Finally, Tsubame and Misha got together for the three-legged race, and honestly? Misha seems to be enjoying it. Not as close as the mother because I don't think she is as ripped as the maid lol. Yet another wonderful episode to remember by just forgetting about the fact that this show is going to be voiced by a lot of cute girls (I'm only in for the maid here lol not for the pecs though) so it's nothing but high-pitched voices which I hate to be honest but this show has the laughs so I'm still liking it I swear JUST GET THE PECS OFF MY EYES lol<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dkP-g-iHTKw/W95sKrJe9QI/AAAAAAAArOQ/XMzb2MrKBzU0pg6UxUEMQdMRNsaTKK0VQCLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru05_eyecatch1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Haha they updated the mid-episode (better known as eyecatch) image<br />(Can we have this for the rest of the series? lol)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jsu5JHVBNyk/W95sKsBoidI/AAAAAAAArOM/Wohm206_O3AtUejHEYr7QND7brhyT0aaACLcBGAs/s320/uzasugiru05_showdown.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Personally?

Lol the one old man asking schoolgirls on meowstagram (lmao) to show low angle YOU SICK FUCK haha thank goodness he got caught but not the maid though I'm sorry Misha-chan she's still legally on the border<br />P.P.S. Misha should be like "You want to be friends so we can be cute together?" and they probably will be picked up as an idol group? Hey, just suggesting if you need more Anime sequel ideas<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v8RzULkYZLs/W95u5PLuS4I/AAAAAAAArOg/oUgRMgCOo4oZpJWO6MDlHp6tqthKwjALQCLcBGAs/s1600/uzasugiru05_angry.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Just thought this should be a GIF haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br />[Update 2018.11.06: Kuraki Mai told me to "Do It" so here I am haha *yawn* it has been a long day]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Gaikotsu Shoten'in Honda-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Just avoiding Honda-san's answer, I would say publishing comics on black &amp; white also allow some form of imagination. Think of fiction books with only a couple of images, for example. Although I would argue it's a little too little I have to guess the colour of Rukia's Bankai?? Oh it's white lol</div></blockquote>On this super real and erotic episode (5) of this bookstore staff series we have more queries that kill lol, famous people killing bookstores because they Tweet (yes as in Twitter), and a killer phone call which almost brought Honda-san to the nearest police station haha. Okay, one at a time, shall we? Firstly, which one is worse? Dealing with someone who literally wants to buy a book for everyone in his village (lol not a China iPhone news reference) (well I can't find the article liao maybe it's fake news?) or dealing with another passionate foreigner? Hey, didn't know you had to deal with this many foreigners as a Japanese, so I'm going with the latter. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I must say, these are truly better than any other complain king that is a local, but with their enthusiasm also comes with their questions like "why are things like this in Japan" that probably a professional who is not Honda-san should answer but hey, he's just a bookstore staff. You can't expect a perfect answer. (Nice one, by the way) Next, is apparently the best publicity the bookstore can have but is also itself a double-edged sword, which is from a manga author. You know, social media is all the hype now, but I didn't know that one retweet of a bookstore (especially by a famous author) online will draw so many people to go buy them. Well, considering they are signed too this will cause some inconvience for the staff, I'm sure. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> No, it's not worth it it's double the work for the same pay, man. I can work less harder haha. Lastly, Honda-san receives the deadliest phone call he can have: someone threatening him because of a bookstore experience by chancing upon the #EroGate as I would like to call it. It is true that many may have chanced upon something at the bookstore accidentally which is kind of overboard and you know, with puberty naturally you'll start to like that stuff which will ruin your life, and I guess you come back to reprimand the staff for accidentally showing you stuff? It happens, man. Blaming people and stuff. Thankfully, Honda-san handled it like a&nbsp; pro (see I told you he's a pro <span title="*wink*">😉</span>) and make the customer feel like he's not cheated *<a href="https://9gag.com/gag/aZ3o2K6/when-you-thought-asobi-asobase-is-a-moe-anime-by-looking-on-its-manga-cover" target="_blank">looks at Asobi Asobase</a>* just by looking at the pure cover and seeing what is inside. Hey, you tell me, Asoken. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JmARv9o-pcU/W-BpI5DUgYI/AAAAAAAArQs/pYpXJN5foaMlWs7iI9yamhSk6enKkZDjwCLcBGAs/s320/hondasan05_hug.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Things I want any girl to do to me lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OIyKzMnysJI/W-BpI5DFAxI/AAAAAAAArQw/B-XKoZtEhb4h6grvPgpg8DmKXBZUoS_zACLcBGAs/s320/hondasan05_selfie.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Things I want any girl to do to me lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Well, <strike>Apple Music don't release Anime songs on time</strike> Anime music labels don't happen to stream their songs online too, so... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's then talk about what I listened to this week. <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>TWEEDEES' new album</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/delicious/1438103655?app=music"></iframe></span></div> is... nothing great. To be honest, it might be their most disappointing album yet. Second was probably their best here, first was shabby, and this one... I didn't even give the topic song. I may only give one song only which on first impression barely passes, mind you, so I don't know how bad I shall describe the release in general tbh. <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Numakura Manami's new single</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/desires-single/1439049075?app=music"></iframe></span></div> was probably better than the previous mentioned, but then again I only managed to give the topic song because it has her vibes and the music video saw her dancing for the first time in her solo music career haha. Anyways, not giving the B-sides, and I did watch the music video in full in case you thought the one on YouTube was in full, and... she's great. As a person. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Lastly, thank goodness to the parent company Lantis for releasing the one music video from <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>TECHNOBOYS' new single</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/isbn-inner-sound-books-narrative-book-end-happy-end-single/1439396424?app=music"></iframe></span></div> (I'm not going to put the full name here) (And I'm not doing the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/81659/Lucy_Yamagami">Servant x Service shortline for names</a>) for Anime "Gaikotsu Shoten'in Honda-san" which should have came out this week but... well, I haven't got to it yet. So <div class="popup"><span class="normal">the music video for the ending theme </span><span class="pop"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ujZz7nFkS0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></div> will be a good start. Let's see if I can even give the opening theme haha<br /><br />On best album releases, <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Chatmonchy's best album</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/best-monchy-1-listening/1439392972?app=music"></iframe></span></div> for the final time will likely not make it to my shelf mainly because I still have to give it three songs before it passes and... I only gave chance to two. Too bad, my girls. <div class="popup"><span class="normal"><b>Kalafina's best album</b></span><span class="pop"><iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *;" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/jp/album/kalafina-all-time-best-2008-2018/1438705800?app=music"></iframe></span></div> suffered from the same fate too, but mainly due to the overplaying of similar style with a whole lot of uninspirational melodies. What happened to you, Kajiura-sensei, seriously. Anyways, probably will give one of them because I brainwashed myself on the album over the weekend so hopefully that will help as a last spurt to their end. Yeah, it's ending. <div class="popup"><span class="normal">Hikaru-san's leaving too already </span><span class="pop"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And...
