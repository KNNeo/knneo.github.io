Okay I've got to wake up early tomorrow (don't ask but it's related to Army lol) so I have to finish this as soon as possible. Damn, I typed too much in one day should've done this yesterday but you know a friend asked me out to play GTA Online so I couldn't refuse and now I have to rush through all of this I started on Sunday afternoon btw okay let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"So Mitsuyoshi, did you tell her what you want to say?" A-HA! I KNEW IT lol</div></blockquote>DAMMIT RACHEL should be everyone else's reaction because she just exhibited the character of a bossy old woman (a.k.a. an auntie from where I live) but hey, thanks to her we'll get a good conclusion. The final episode (13) gives us a happy ending (not written by that detective novel author) (Wait, it was Rachel??) on this wonderful love story we all anticipated till the end. In the end... yeah I would say they have delivered. I will talk about what lacks therein but let's focus on what they got right. Firstly, the turning point. Thanks to Ijuin, Mitsuyoshi got talked the f**k out of his original intent for coming all the way to meet Teresa. I mean, just to say hi? Why bother curbing your greatest fears? So yeah, I'll be harsher than Ijuin by literally throwing the letter into the water but nature did it instead to not make his friend look like an a**hole even though I am one haha best not be friends with me. Mitsuyoshi proves his point by picking it up in the most original way possible, and attends the final event (lol) which was a banquet offered by Rachel in the form of an invitation letter. You know, palace-level love confession like we've always wanted - which brings us to our next point. Secondly then, is the confession. Even though both sides sort of said the love was at first sight in case you didn't get the feel after all the dialogues, which is what both mentioned to show that they just like each other and being together, whether it's photography that made it better (damn you don't know how much adjustments you can use a camera on to make someone look gorgeous) or Rainbow Shogun (lol) or the North Star story or all of them, but we do know is the love is real. It did stem up from the various activities which was intended as training for royalty but turned out to be the best romance experience ever. That, the Anime production and scriptwriter got it right. And lastly, conclusion. I didn't expect it, to say the least. It'll of course be life is back to normal, Pin-senpai has to graduate, Tada-kun takes over the club (I mean, find me another competent club leader) (No, a MALE leader lmao) and so on but... on Larsenburg (I swear I'm spelling this for the last time) it's a totally different story. The engagement was called off (I totally expect the marriage to still happen), Charles hangs out with Alec now (Alexandra "the red-haired liar" Magritte) and... Teresa comes back for her true love?? What? Then, what happens to the castle? Is it just done? One minus one royalty descendant equals zero, you know. Well... I guess they won't go so far as to explain the kind of end-show stuff (I mean, Anime "Tsuki ga Kirei" didn't either), but I don't know. It feels a bit weird, certainly. But as Rachel said at the end, if it all comes to a good ending, then yes this is one, and I'll take it. The journey down the line of episodes was fantastic, covering good amount of content and varying between characters and telling everyone's (true) love stories all around. What was lackluster maybe is the extent in doing so, from rants to confessions to why they let Teresa cry two days consecutively etc. All these can be provided with a little more context (they can only reference the night sky during the photo shoot bootcamp during their confessions) and it'll relate real quick (at least in the dramasphere) if some words or actions can be extreme. I don't feel it much but... I feel like it can be much better. But hey, I'll still say this is good. It gave us a good ending, wonderful stories and jokes, a lovely foreign girl... what more can you ask? Someone make me a sequel so I can give the title "Tada-kun Falls In Love" without the "never", yes? SOMEONE DO IT haha<br />[Again, sorry for being so critical I've watched Anime 10 years already I gotta have expectations]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UnFFMq7CUQs/WziFv4-3DVI/AAAAAAAAoGQ/mGOvjx9DkKsblffa6ubcgCbkGVNcSWT5gCLcBGAs/s320/tadakoi13_teresa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I'll end this series with two of the most wonderful characters here.<br />Firstly, Teresa-chan!<br />(She so cute, I wish <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/44317/Manaka_Iwami">Iwami-san</a> was this cute too hehe)</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="hover"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iEySJhJ7BVw/WziFxKpe42I/AAAAAAAAoGU/dwu2s3bAdQ0zO2_Gt_WzqWc4jV1qQKvCwCLcBGAs/s320/tadakoi13_alec.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I'll end this series with two of the most wonderful characters here.<br />Also, Alec-san!<br />("Gotta see what's happening" lol don't you do it you-)</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S. #nocontext but it's hard being a handsome and good gentleman like Charles tbh also #imagegoals<br />P.P.S. I guess it wasn't too much of a hint considering it appeared in the end, but yeah, Rachel was the author of the detective novel Alec and Yui-chan have been reading, apparently. As I said, we have no idea how far relations go between her and the grandfather, but suffice it to say all the love (the mystery to say the least) comes from her. Breaking the 4th wall there, production. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Fumikiri Jikan</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Zero?" "Don't make me say it again" Damn it hurts me as much as it hurts her haha</div></blockquote>Okay, the final episode of the series (12) or season if this ever comes back, comes back (literally) to the main two girls from episode 1. In case you need a quick recap, the two girls were schoolmates, and the junior love confessed to her senior. Yeah. Sure it's weird, and the senior did clarify in this episode after all, so as it all happens, "all's well is well", I guess. I mean, don't ask me too I have zero love experience lol the jokes in this show are great. To summarise this series, I like the jokes so DON'T TELL ME HOW THE EPISODES ARE ONLY THREE MINUTES LONG AND THEY STILL WANT TO RELEASE BLU-RAY WHICH TOTALS TO LIKE FORTY MINUTES CONTENT sorry the train's running by I gotta speak louder lmao<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTxd-odLFw0/WziIu06o0zI/AAAAAAAAoGg/Yw6mQxF17wATfdBT540nORhyeNd9YTZRgCLcBGAs/s320/fumikirijikan12_couple.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My face when I'm cross-dressed perfectly and I want to f**k a schoolgirl</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. #AnimeSelfAwareness when you call people names and know those names are terrible lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Layton Mystery Tanteisha: Katri no Nazotoki File</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">When people doubt my years of experience (as a human being) I'll make sure people see my eyebrow twitching by bringing a magnifying glass for them or record a gif lol</div></blockquote>Wow the dog sounds as condescending as my mom haha okay let's talk about this show. Hmm... how should I put it... it's interesting? THREE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT FOR THIS SHOW!! Firstly, how I came about watching this. Thanks to of course, main girl and voice actress and also ending theme singer Hanazawa Kana do I know about this... rather intriguing mystery drama series I thought I'll never watch. And at this point, I must say I am interested. Secondly, what this is about. It's your typical mystery drama series but starring a kid (no this is not Detective Conan) or specifically the father's detective agency which I assume leaves the daughter in with the assistant since he's out all the time. And as I quote myself "if anyone ever is dumb enough to not schedule an appointment but instead come in through the front door" will be met by the most intelligent kid in Europe in the 19th century haha I mean, look at her. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> *eyebrow twitching* Of course looks are deceiving, as the little girl easily proves to us how much detail she sees above others and deducing mysteries before... probably any kid watching this who is younger than me can comprehend considering I can't do it this fast too. Lastly, let's talk specifics about the episode. The first episode (1) talks about Simon, this poor rich guy who has his family disappear time after time thanks to a crooked painting on a house sold by some suspicious real estate agent and a dog which automatically cleans up messes as it sees them. There, saved you the time to watch the show. Although I would encourage you to watch though rather childish this show may present itself, is not as compared to Anime "PriPri Chii-chan" I watched last year, I promise. There's suspense, some seconds for you to figure out given the hints throughout the investigation, and some emotion in the backstories... I say this covers all the grounds of a good Anime. If you want deeper mysteries or even those extreme dark ones, don't come here. But if not, you're welcome to step into Datyon's Detective Agency for a personal consultation with&nbsp;Katrielle Layton. Just make sure the father's not here and your case is valid don't start to trick this girl she's smarter than most of us lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ytMcC_kPmsU/WziTkCZSzZI/AAAAAAAAoGs/2ygWuVjZmLwXKVFQX2y4CWqYZ_24sC27ACLcBGAs/s320/layton01_idea.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Spoiler alert but, you're going to see this every episode from now on lmao</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I'm like "if everyone in your house disappeared how come you're still around" lol #YoureTheKidnapper<br />P.P.S. It's a lie kids you don't get such a big house even if you worked hard Layton-chan is right he's just a rich kid who got inheritance haha just joking kids<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://randomc.net/2018/06/29/summer-preview-2018/" target="_blank">Summer Anime 2018 Preview</a></span></div></blockquote>(Remember to come back after clicking on the link please)<br />Opinions on the new season of Anime:<br /><ul><li>BANANA FISH (airs 5th July): Not interested in plot (it's like L.A.Noire but with heavier context in war so... no)</li><li>Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro (airs 6th July): It's <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/22329/Naomi_Oozora" target="_blank">Naomi-chan</a>'s next big role (unless you watched her <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/20457/Inari_Konkon_Koi_Iroha" target="_blank">2014 romance Anime</a>) as a main character and the story is totally a joke, and Random Curiosity wrote as fun to watch since it describes the life of something you'll never do which is going to school without getting distracted lmao</li><li>Hataraku Saibou (airs 7th July): I may just watch 1st episode to see how heavy in technical knowledge it gets (as long as they describe things I'm fine, but explain further then please make it short), the plot seems interesting anyways (lol cancer bacteria), there's Kana-chan in a main role again... we'll see haha</li><li>Asobi Asobase (airs 8th July): It's Aho Girl stupid but with all kinds of games I assume, I may not get used to the animation so I'll have a test of 1st episode to see if I can forgive it, but otherwise you've got a cast of very new female voice actresses, so I'll remember this based on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYDZAvNJQkM" target="_blank">first impression of the promotional video</a> because it made me crack lmao</li><li>Jashin-chan Dropkick (airs 9th July): Random Curiosity relates the show to Anime like "Binbougami ga!" and "Gabriel Dropout" (which I did not watch the latter), the promotional content did not reveal much of the plot, but the animation looks good and it's just one of those I-can't-get-back-to-my-world-so-let-me-stay-in-your-human-house-for-now stories, so... I'll give a chance based on my mood and considering Gabriel Dropout got so much attention over the past few years (I'm saying based on Reddit experience haha)</li></ul>And I swear I most definitely DID NOT choose these shows to talk about which air in chronological in order lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Kuroshitsuji</span></div></blockquote>The new chapter (141) sort of concludes on the duo Ciel reality by... explaining how (dammit what did I use to refer to him) (oh yes) other Ciel came back to life, from the moment Undertaker saved him, and practically brought him around to all of Ciel Ciel's adventures. Hey, don't say your brother's not with you lol. On the other hand, Undertaker has made two statements which will haunt us for this chapter. Firstly, he leaves us to our imagination to his relation with the Phantomhive family, something we will not get an answer from even the past few chapters. Because you see, it means a lot if he is an ancestor perhaps, someone who is concerned about Phantomhives living because he saw the future at some point (I mean, he was a shinigami he probably knew something), or even worse, that's the father. Okay, the last is unlikely, but yeah, the extent can go real far depending on that answer, which was not given. Second, Undertaker took specific words (and actions, mostly hugging) into account when showing Ciel Ciel how wonderfully reconstructed other Ciel is, neglecting the fact that resurrection is never possible to be completed, other Ciel is technically dead even to the eyes of shinigami (which will explain why no shinigami appeared at that place years ago because he's technically dead maybe), and the other shinigami are here. Remember? When the shinigami are here someone's got to be dead. Although one would argue that it's them trying to apprehend the wanted criminal I would say that considering the difficulty in doing that there can easily be a second objective. Hey, all in a day's work of a shinigami, man. Now to see who next will be involved. I mean, even Sebastian didn't figure all of this out for some reason. THE BOY WAS UNDER THE GRAVE!! HE DIDN'T DEMON SMELL THAT OUT?? IS HE TECHNICALLY ALIVE?? AFTER ALL THE EXPERIMENTS??? You tell me haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="350" data-original-width="334" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YrqoZdrhtyM/WzhGPA-fynI/AAAAAAAAoGA/Fs3ns8On_hcDyDVBBY84CVZKtDsDucyFQCLcBGAs/s320/14118.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="305" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Spoiler-free image of the beloved (ex-)laughing shinigami</td></tr></tbody></table>Note: The term "shinigami" refers to Death Gods, or just Grim Reapers in English context<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>æ˜ ç”»</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MOVIE</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Seitokai Yakuindomo The Movie</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><strike>I should not be</strike>&nbsp;Should I be f**king glad that the principal takes no care to the comments of these sick individuals? lol</div></blockquote>Eh... I did watch a couple more OVAs I missed in the past couple of months it's out, and now I have the time to watch them all, so let's talk about the movie instead haha. The OVAs did provide some context before understanding what the heck is with this movie though, because I swear no newbie will understand this movie if they just suddenly want to watch this in the cinemas (lol) and this is just two OVA episodes followed by 10 minutes of original content so... yeah that's it. What, you want me to mention more? Sure. If you followed the antics of this series before, it's on surface talking about an all girls' school becoming co-ed, and the troubles of the student council having to deal with the many things (sexually implied or not) in the school itself. As of the OVAs in season two which were released after every successive volume of the manga (by the way the movie was packaged on the special edition of Volume 16 and the titles were labelled as season 2 episodes 20 and 21) the show descended into pretty much just series of jokes where straight people have to retort and everything else that is rated mature or otherwise is more shown in action than in speech lol. Yeah, that's really it. Because this show itself also has a lot of points to talk about, I can't possibly talk about all of them, so I'll simplify everything into three main categories: What is required for your understanding to watch this movie/latest episode of OVA, what was new in this movie whether its you watching the Anime only or totally original content, and what was behind all this production we can see in difference to the past works. [1] If you want to watch this from scratch please start from the beginning otherwise Uomi-neesan will make no sense to you, but otherwise if you have at least watched the second season of the Anime the best recommendation is to watch the OVAs first in order first because there is still some level of plot progression necessary to understand some context including Uomi's frequent visits to Tsuda's place. Also, the latest OVAs also reveal their newest character in the series Mori-san, which is served as a straight person and right-hand man to Uomi in Eiryou High School, so the interrogation (?) in the movie will make more sense. [2] The movie presents several plot progression lines which will be interesting to talk about other than the normal student council stuff. Firstly, the principal of the school has appeared! He looks like some junkie when he was 16 but that's not the point as he did ask Tsuda about any girl he... adores, I assume? We can also assume the principal (as a man) has heard of the... sexual tendencies of the staff and students in school to not care so much during their interview as seen in the movie. The new plot line personally written by author Ujie Tozen for the movie which is supposedly Tsuda is transferring school as he is invited by Uomi to Eiryou High. Spoiler alert: he didn't, but hey you can imagine the craziness happening school-wide to this incident. Hey, he's 9th most popular student in the school after all lol. [3] Production-wise the movie itself has taken it to crazy lengths including the demo of 5.1 surround sound simulating theatre experience (if you use stereo speakers like me you'll notice in the quiz segments Tsuda and Suzu sound muffled since they are... excuse the engineering stuff for a moment, recorded as if they are situated behind the recording device which is what you hear in the cinema or room setting that stereo speakers or even headphones cannot replicate) at the start of the movie, more crisp and true-to-life animations so to <strike>justify their animation budget</strike> give the best possible visual experience and show off the content in the show hopefully without mosaics haha, and cranking their hentai levels up to the maximum possible since age-gating is no longer an issue because we're in movie theaters lol. All in all, it gave me as much laughs as it did with all the OVAs and shows before that, and I wish for the sake of the Anime to come up with a new season because they've re-using the theme songs for years already, seriously. Hopefully we'll get a revival of the animation soon not in the form of OVAs, for I'd like to watch a lot more of these jokes to remind how sick of a pervert I am haha also I'm lazy in catching up with the manga and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32797/Shino_Amakusa" target="_blank">Yocchan</a> and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/32798/Aria_Shichijou" target="_blank">Satomi-chan</a> sound erotic too hehe<br /><div class="thumbnail"><span class="normal"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="576" data-original-width="1024" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zEnz5v_1CRc/WzjKqVBEmwI/AAAAAAAAoG4/0ayqbqfmFm8BzutwYgqmH8pFhyLwj3P8QCLcBGAs/s320/seitokaimovie_2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Is there any female student particularly in your mind?"<br />Tsuda: "It's Hata-san."</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="hover"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="576" data-original-width="1024" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V4tc1LQXjgY/WzjKqi8QGDI/AAAAAAAAoG8/h6F8SPvfRpMmjPWNG11SwoUV3nRfCX87wCLcBGAs/s320/seitokaimovie_3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Is there any female student particularly in your mind?"<br />Tsuda: "It's Hata-san."</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S.

I also took a listen to <b>Minase Inori and Touyama Nao's live performances</b> and... I gave naobou a song I didn't give back then because according to me last year "I don't want to portray her too much of a cute idol image" or something like that but yeah I didn't have the mood to give her those anyways, so... now's a good time I guess. I also gave <b>Komagata Yuri's debut single</b> more listens so welcome, one of the two B-sides. I also gave a listen to <b>SHISHAMO's new album</b> to no conclusion: turns out I just can't bear to give them any melodies because I know they aren't good. *sigh* Next time, girls. For more information be sure to follow my Twitter account, yes?<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of albums I'm interested in following the recent discoveries at the start of this segment, including an indie artist named <b>Non Stop Rabbit</b> backed up by huge production of familiar artists and <b>Sunrise In My Attache Case</b>&nbsp;since it's been some time since I gave a listen to them and the new music video isn't that bad. The interesting stuff are releasing the week after, so be patient, yes?<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">For the last time I heard of Sunrise In My Attache Case, this is a pretty good motivating song tbh<br /><br />Their new mini-album releases next week! <a href="https://t.co/iAYZLVTsB7">https://t.co/iAYZLVTsB7</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1012157691072933888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2018</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> <br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done. I really need to do some stuff (including shower) so I can... stay awake for a day of briefings tomorrow haha. That's all I can say though, it's technically classified information lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I'll still be in the thick of it so I guess my game consumption time will be greatly reduced from tomorrow onwards *sigh* see ya<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
