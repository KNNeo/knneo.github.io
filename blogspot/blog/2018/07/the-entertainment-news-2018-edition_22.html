Hey... This week, I was a liar. I lied to everyone around me that I was job-hunting. So you see this is why you should write a blog you can write things like this so you don't feel so bad about myself I should start sending my resume soon haha<br /><br />Okay let's start we need to buff up (my resume too, but) my entertainment every week for this season so I can appropriately de-stress <strike>in case I</strike>&nbsp;I can't bear to say that I still want to be alive lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Asobi Asobase</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Do it at home" DAMN SHE NAILED IT ON THE LOT OF THEM</div></blockquote>Goddamn Hanako is a national treasure haha she teaches us the real life stuff, ladies. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> The new episode (2) of the series (in which I haven't even given the theme songs yet) still gives us as many endings as you can imagine, which seriously makes me flare up like the ending song and possibly... be giving my next death metal song since Anime "K-ON!" in 2010. No I swear, this show is weird. Now that I'm no longer a student and I can't do that put-your-stuff-at-your-back (literally) stunt anymore, let's talk about the episode. (As you can see I'm trying to put as many jokes in my review so you guys will go watch it) Three main topics are raised today introducing to us more secondary characters that we can handle. Firstly, the new student council president. Don't ask how she got elected (KILL ME BABY I'll never vote for that four-eyed bi- *cues male voice* -tch no matter what), but suffice it to say now she has to be in the position to approve stupid clubs like these. Hey, she got herself covered when she said she'll play with anyone to get - in contrary to what anyone desires - whatever she wants, to say the least. Next, is basically female audience bait. But heck, do girls watch this? I see it as a disaster if you're like, in middle school and you watch this show lol. On the other hand, as Hanako mentioned in total jealousy, you don't need makeup to be famous, but as Olivia said, it's practice. Yeah I get it but *looks at quote* haha you get it already. Then again, someone must be doing a terrible job of makeup to make it looks like a school bully incident haha. Lastly, is <strike>Honoka</strike> Hanako's revenge to her soft tennis club. Surrounded by popular girls who want popular guys and a coach who wants her back desperately, you can guess that the non-title match between the two clubs (I wouldn't call the latter a club) will go. If you didn't laugh at Kasumi breaking the custom <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hagoita" target="_blank">hagoita</a> you need to grow a nerve. And as I continue to stretch on my laughing nerves this show will get me somewhere. I can feel it. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> And I think it will too for you guys. Well, if you can take gags in the first place. This one is not for amateurs. *plays death metal music*<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu9geFl4HNA/W0yOkuTWFvI/AAAAAAAAoiA/N5Rbb1B6XUYUoLAuT-_S5_Jcrpsu1653gCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase02_olivia.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I've heard of "one ear in, one ear out" but not with the same mouth lmao</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JHvd5lHcd_w/W0yOkj-KV5I/AAAAAAAAoiE/ojgFIImBV1QUTHw4HmDm8peDQeMsHTBAgCLcBGAs/s320/asobiasobase02_eyecatch2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I seriously want the drawings to be good. <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fc-kmIQl5l8/W1SSgH0-6jI/AAAAAAAAosM/FpakFZbjNfoRBFXuEm1TxZYWL4kcZD7MgCLcBGAs/s1600/0716b.png" target="_blank">I seriously do.</a></td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. YOU GUYS THINK I CAN LEAVE THIS REVIEW WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE SUPER RIPPED FEMALE(?) TEACHER WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW MAKEUP??? I'm pretty sure someone will know the reference here but I'm popular so I don't know tehe<br />P.P.S. Like seriously, must they give those fugly faces when the girls are supposed to be at their best? I mean, Hanako looks better in the screwed up makeup then the normal animation of her for some reason lol<br />[Let's see... looking at the credits (and MAL) I know Olivia is voiced by the one who did for Joe-kun if you remember "PriPri Chii-chan" and Kasumi is voiced by the one who... get this: she voiced Akane-chan in "Tsuki ga Kirei" OMG]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Banana Fish</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">I mean, if you're into little boys and you listen to Eiji OF COURSE you have to protect Ash hehe</div></blockquote>Wow. I seriously don't know whether to continue with this series or not, but I would have to say I should. The new episode (3) continues on Ash's adventures as he is admitted into prison, but of course, he's not going to have a good time there. But this episode is also pivotal not because of the... homosexual references, but of the truth. We have finally been given some clue, or as far as there is, about what Banana Fish is. It's likely an organisation. Person unlikely, since it got so many rumours and people who knew about it killed. And its latest truth-seeker had to sacrifice his life for it, as seen in episode 1. The drug, is apparently part of the likely drug trafficking system running in the underground, which would explain how this has never been seen by many, even the... not to legal doctors. Sadly, this investigation which has been handed over to the innocent boy Eiji, may end right here as Arthur - instead of the prison boys who have been dispatched by Dino and should have tortured the main guy to get information out of him - has gotten in the tracks. What will happen next? Man, this show makes cliffhangers so good, it made the kissing scene look like a joke. And I still believe it is. Although I would most likely want to assume that this is the reason why it probably did not get an Anime adaptation 20 years ago, this show still delivers great quality in terms of plot portrayal and everything else in between. Maybe now is a good time to think of how to give the theme songs.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jF-8VfijuZg/W1Rt6MpdaII/AAAAAAAAorA/4eGWy5unW5QzISOa82JUdg80abcxDq4xwCLcBGAs/s320/bananafish03_eiji.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I mean, if you can get past this part, there's a good mystery behind this show.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Chio-chan no Tsuugakuro</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Have a drink every time they say Bloody Butterfly" lol (oh you guys don't know drinking games?)</div></blockquote>And... that's why they put the boob physics into the show IT'S FOR KABADDI??? Lmao and welcome to the new episode (3) where we talk about bike gangs, kabaddi and physical tests that Chio-chan tries so hard to be on the border? Man, this show has everything haha. And by the way, Chio-chan is WAAAAAY too cool to be on this show lol. Okay, the episode. Firstly, the boring stuff. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> The bike gang leader as we know of now as Andou, is seen again in the park as Chio-chan is on her way (to school of course) and... she decides to make sure people don't speak of her "name" again haha. So yeah, they do up a decent "show" to make sure the members do not question their leader again. But man, that was quite a show. I like how the one guy is not scared of a high school girl but totally freak out when Andou tells him he'll get killed lol. Okay, now for the fun stuff haha. Didn't know I was actually that invested into giving yuri until this particular episode (and you thought the kissing thing in the Anime before this was weird) but yeah we're introduced to another new character Kushitori, and it all started from a joke. Yeah. Hey, you wished your journey to school was this funny. Okay, besides laughing my hardest in this series and this seasons of Anime with Manana-chan (Omigawa-san can we get more of your laughs please?) As female voice actors are my fetish as what fellow female schoolmates is to Kushitori-senpai, as expected she cannot resist when you play with her Kabaddi Club against the rules (I'll leave you guys to figure out what my fetish is in this scene hehe). You learn these in video games? Man, I gotta play games more. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, it was a total joy to laugh at, and man this show just keeps getting better with those sexual references. Stellar cast, I must say (<span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> fetishism), and I think Chio-chan and Manana-chan will have to sign up for secondary clubs to practice their yoga lmao. Just to end this, I like how we have no idea Kushitori-senpai is a freak until they draw close up animations on her face haha this show is fantastic<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_k4pGFTJso/W1R3LR9MtkI/AAAAAAAAorM/trQmssn6Z_soiwSJyZ5mMya9QU_2SswWgCLcBGAs/s320/chiochan03_hug.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Here's your only hint for the statement "Kushitori-senpai likes girls" haha</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SWnbUodlPl8/W1R3LT0g4HI/AAAAAAAAorQ/vmEPdJgPG7EfiQLyiwYNSTnKF23OyvWBACLcBGAs/s320/chiochan03_hosokawa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You know you wouldn't be this happy when you get touched lol<br />(No I cannot show that stuff this is a family website)</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div></div>P.S. "I'll need to get rid of her next" lol NO MANANA-CHAN NO haha<br />P.P.S. It's like when you joke about kabaddi until someone is there to teach you about it... that's my university life in a nutshell haha I should stop making fun about my major<br />[REACTION MONTAGE!!!

Heck, it sucks to even be a basic form of the human bodylol</div></blockquote>"We got bored of the main girl, so we changed focus characters" haha no that's likely not the intent buy as you can see they can't always let Kana-chan take all the limelight lol. The new episode (3) still is not enough to convince me to continue with this show, to say the least. (But the opening theme song is burnt in my brain liao so...) Let's talk about what is keeping me away from this show and giving me the creeps. Firstly, the emotional stories behind it. As you have watched it, the one naive T cell, after much introduction, suffers from an unusual character? I mean, this sure is weird in this show, and most likely not any level of depiction of how the human body works (no really, no one has proven that your body cells are pussies), but if this is how they get the kids in (with the kids as platelets too) then I'm not giving it. Next, is how straightforward silly is. I know I don't mind these kinds of shows, but every episode of seeing an enemy and clearing it every time (well, until a virus mutation happens in this case) is getting kind of repetitive, because you know how eventually wins. Thirdly, introductions. I won't say it's the subs I'm watching this show with is getting in the way (it's to improve readability as the narrator reads it all out) but suffice it to say that every time a cell needs to be introduced it kind of breaks the momentum of the show significantly, and that kind of pisses me off. I mean, you know action shows don't do too much introduction- Oh they do? No wonder I'm not watching most of them haha. Lastly, the jokes. Sorry but, I'm entertained, not having a laugh. Unlike the previous show in review above (lol) this one is not cut out for jokes. I guess I'll only get the puns and everything else... let's just say it's more lame than funny. So yeah, I may not be giving this show after all. "Food poisoning"?? No, not interested. You guys can have a laugh if you enjoyed it though; I'd rather take care of my body than watch it.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C8MwkwJR6aM/W1R--eg5RrI/AAAAAAAAorg/bi9Lh2JZ2nQgCsd0xVDFkWZMRI9-NELGACLcBGAs/s320/hatarakusaibou03_sorry.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW this show is popular but I didn't enjoy it lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. And thanks for Kana-chan's heavy absence in this episode so I can make this pivotal decision of NOT watching it haha no really Kana-chan isn't everything<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">A Channel</span></div></blockquote>I'm just going to talk about the end cards of the 8th Volume (known as "A-channel communications") of the comic real quick since it's not much content. It typically touches on experiences the readers have encountered in real life and the author kudoda bb-sensei, will draw them out. Hey, #manga_irl, everybody. So yeah, it covers from accidents to sleeping in bathtubs to pampering your pet cat to horror stories to Nagi-chan's dad... wait I thought this was not for canon? Haha anyways it was a quick and funny read. Man, A Channel is still interesting as a slice-of-life story. And I'm still wondering why I haven't watched that OVA episode which is on hold for like, two months already. (Oops, but yeah even if I watched it I might not do a review here)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="317" data-original-width="245" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PvNNA4QjHCQ/W1SPSdnQYGI/AAAAAAAAosA/2xdRQbBAO7YKQ_5ht_gIwcx4L-7WWC1ewCLcBGAs/s200/115.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="154" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I mean, if you were the father you'll like your daughter hehe</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><strike>This week is a dull week</strike> I mean, every week is a dull week if I'm going to judge like this haha. Okay, let's talk about the <strike>stuff</strike> music I've listened to this week which are good. Let's get <b>[Alexandros] new single</b> out of the day because (1) I'm not watching the real live action movie of BLEACH and (2) man that was a terrible single. Yeah, you guys heard this here first. No seriously, it sucked. Especially compared to my impression of them in 2016. Then again, their performance this year isn't spectacular, so let's move on. <b>Kuso Iinkai's new single</b> isn't that interesting too as the topic song failed to catch my attention so I'm diverting my mood to the B-sides and hopefully I'll give one of them I'm into one of them at the moment so that's good news. <b>FINLAND's 2nd full album</b>, as mentioned last week, was... not as bad as I thought. It's like a better version of SHISHAMO (sorry, girls) but then again I can't really love that high-pitched vocalist you're no Hashimoto Eriko (from Chatmonchy) dear girl. Nonetheless I'll give a couple more songs while I'm at it their melodies are decent anyway. Lastly, <b>Natsukawa Shiina's 3rd single</b> is NOT going up on my shelf anytime soon since I can reject her B-side. The topic song though... I feel for her screams, and I did mention I like that cry which is present on her previous single but this has taken it to a thousand, so...<br /><br />Well next week's going to be boring at Klassic Note (unless I exclude those releases I'm lazy to write on my Excel document now) so <b>I may go back to a couple of releases for the month</b> I say I want to give chance again, like miwa's best album and Niitsu Yui's "debut album". Also, I've only given one (and that's with a female vocalist too so that's going to affect results this year) of the many indie artists I've listened to last month, so I may go back and dig around again. Wish me luck.<br /><br />This week in my Twitterverse (it's a term, apparently) <b>Sambomaster's new single</b> has revealed itself on the Internet in a short music video on YouTube and digital release two weeks before official release, <b>LuckLife's new music video</b> (the song) is real disappointing, Y<b>oru no Honki Dance's new music video</b> (the song) is amazing as usual, and I might want to give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mFrhS3ywEE" target="_blank">these guys</a> a chance. We'll see about that next week. Oh, and if you live in the USA chances this <a href="https://polsy.org.uk/stuff/ytrestrict.cgi?ytid=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8mFrhS3ywEE" target="_blank">VEVO music video is blocked in your region</a>. I learnt it through my quick coding session this week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I guess this is it for this week. Cya guys next week, where... I hope I won't be employed yet I'm quite enjoying this freedom haha. Also, the new GTA Online update is coming soon, so I gotta prepare for that. (Audience: I thought you don't play GTA anymore) (Well, not when you have <strike>friends</strike> a friend to play with) (Man, I wish I could play with Aki-chan she plays it) Until next time, guys. I hope you're gainfully employed and getting good money for doing... I should consider a government job instead private companies are too much for me lol<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
