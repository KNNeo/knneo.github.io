<h2>The Entertainment News 2018 Edition Issue #3</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Yeah you BET I was watching <a href="http://ch.nicovideo.jp/nanitsuku" target="_blank">Nanitsuku</a> before I came here to finish this post for the week hehe<br /><br />As some has mentioned in the comments, I would love to see someone with (some) experience in cooking and also a voice actress do cooking. Like, switch around every episode, you know? I suggest Ten-chan, and some said that too. Haha people want Rie-chan to sing Kimagure Romantic while cooking (see Anime below on Takagi-san, I'm referring to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/album/id1328124152" target="_blank">ending theme</a>)<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san</span></div></blockquote>Man, Nishikata is stupid haha. The new episode (2) kind of shows some form of mystery and of course, some form of affection, from Takagi's actions. Why? Let's talk about it. Mystery because sometimes we have no idea how she reads his mind, but then again most of the time it's kind of obvious, once you watch this show long enough lol. Affection-wise, it's plenty to show. If you're really interested in someone, you'd actually spend more time with him or her, and that is what Takagi-san is doing anyway, so yeah, Nishikata is dumb haha. Not to insult this boy further, the scenes this episode are real. Real as in real easy to avoid being pranked. If I were in his shoes (I need to make this into a series here) straightforwardness is the easiest answer, and of course, not to fight with a girl. I mean, I'm not feminist or anything, because Nishikata is a blockhead and a sore loser, he always falls in every "trap" Takagi seemingly sets up for him, even though most of the time it's not true. Firstly, calligraphy. What Nishikata thought of first was actually, the best answer. But telling her to scram may not be as easy as it seems, even though this is a good start. And everything else is just dessert to Takagi hehe. As I said, he doesn't know. Heck, even we don't know, so what else is new? Then, there's English lesson. As mentioned last week, if he paid attention like Takagi would whilst making conversation then nothing is a trap. Takagi was just smart enough to make sure you'd misunderstand the page number for Math lesson? Damn this boy is dumb haha. Lastly, it's not that obvious, but because there isn't a good hint, I would - in his shoes - give up on the question. That will also leave her in a pinch as she tries to not explain her situation because there isn't any. There. Problems solved. Middle school math is tougher than this, Nishikata; wise up some day would you? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GaoBDykeKo4/Wl3EYZaoauI/AAAAAAAAkaU/f8U1Tw6xP60HsMGZdcv8CGBcaYK2RS3bACLcBGAs/s320/takagisan02_period.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Nope, I'm definitely not thinking naughty when I took this thumbnail haha<br />(No seriously, period blood is gross omg girls please don't kill me)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I like how I'm reminded about the secondary characters because apparently the spin-off series is also included as source reference (see start of opening theme animation, there are two titles) and they tell a different story. Well, mostly simple comedy, but I like that touch. At least it gives a feel for how the show feels overall and how feel like this show's length could've been cut in half. (Damn, why did I keep mentioning half-length episodes? lol)<br />P.P.S. Ah, I thought of a title for my new mini-series for this show. "Karakai Kaihi", which also means 'banter evasion'. Thanks, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.jp.globalgear.kaihi" target="_blank">random mobile game I've played before</a>. Stay tuned next week as this master - no, god-like genius here strives to evade all the plays Takagi throws at Nishikata haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new episode (2) talks about the very familiar episode which I recall from reading the manga (and I swear I've mentioned it before here last year), so I'll talk about the differences in style of doing this now compared to the Anime. Firstly, the story is about a typhoon day, where it's too dangerous to go back home for the Endou siblings (and Hotaru probably), so they had a sleepover. Simple enough, and this also took only a couple of chapters in the manga, but I'm glad on how far they made it good. Because secondly in animation, they may have cut off quite a few parts to cut short the length of the episode in compensation of completeness but it's done well. For example (spoilers if you didn't read the manga) Tou-kun was seen at home alone, and of course, should be the last person to arrive at the shop. Hotaru was supposed to be seen on the streets and talking about the exhilaration from being outside, but that is not in too. Also, they're most definitely not going to show what happened to Yo-san when he went to his neighbour's place instead of going back home. All in all, I think it's fine, because they did make it consistent enough (Sayashi monologue at the end) to make sure it sounds correct. Adaptation, people. It all makes sense. Still, never get sick of Hotaru fanservice, so despite me covering my eyes when I can see her bra, make sure to keep them coming haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CnQt4lP_b3M/WmP01IlKzsI/AAAAAAAAke0/JnYI6jlcYg49Wg8kihzS2jonlwr3DlBdQCLcBGAs/s320/dagashikashiS2_02_button.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Man if I can <strike>have sex&nbsp;with</strike>&nbsp;get one dollar from Hotaru-san every time she hits that button lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Sangatsu no Lion</span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Kiriyama should be like "Thank goodness I'm not as insane as this guy" lol I mean really snap out of it already you can't be like that robot haha</div></blockquote>The new episode (36) finally, FINALLY brings us Kiriyama x Souya Meijin, and not like I'm hyped for it, but I can't help anyway, so let's talk about it. Ignoring how boring that other tournament with two half-dead old men lol, Kiriyama gets to play a commemorative match with the master himself. Well, of course the chairman must pump things up to make this big news for the shougi world (so he could get all sorts of attention for the shougi committee here), but then again it's taking a toll for the people involved. Kiriyama is just freaking out at that big, beautiful poster and Souya... I guess he's still alive? He looks pretty dead though, as mentioned in the episode, and it feels like a demon, or a zombie to me, as he stays his position as the master of shougi. I guess that's the real life problem? Well, not like I know of it, but he just seems to not have a mind of his own. Probably rehearsed or given words to say, he just answers the media as if it was totally correct. And that, I feel bad for him. I mean, hospitality means bracing the large hotel like you deserved it (a little bit lesser than the Chairman, of course), thinking though the standard questions of an interview at that time (Kiriyama did nothing on that and just stoned in the bath) and just put up that formal image. Guess what? The two did none of them. Yes, not even Souya. But hey, we're not here for formalitites; we're here for a match. And walking in with a change of clothes (go find out why yourself if you haven't watched it), they start the match. Oh heck, next week's going to be <strike>interesting</strike> nothing but shougi battle tactics. Ugh. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_bcNbwrtMmA/WmP80yb1oNI/AAAAAAAAkfE/CG6nRG168hEoUkMZrfZJa9xDZnf80vJVACLcBGAs/s320/sangatsunolion36_whistle.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me when people ask me about the progress on my final year project lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Still thinking whether I even want to give the ending theme song here. RUANN doesn't really give a good song for the Anime tbh<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Slow Start</span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">HAREM?? I KNEW IT THIS SHOW- Oh? It's only female? Oh well. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Now you wonder how Tama-chan knows of harem and "art appreciation" I should use "music appreciation" for Klassic Note then lol</div></blockquote>No seriously, we're getting too many of this. Boobs, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, the new episode (3). It talks about something I didn't expect will come in this strong and quickly - emotions. I came in to this show hoping to see more jokes than cries, but I think that's what's good about doing an adaptation of a 4-koma manga (go find out that yourself) because despite all the timely jokes you can still get some feels here and there every once in a while, and I like it. And it's most definitely because the girls are cute because I wish I could see a more balanced cast (I mean, Eiko and girls lol) with a better plot (<span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> Glasslip) then I may not consider this as being good. But it is. It's got everything, and it still ties in nicely with the origin story for Hana-chan, and that's what will make it good. That reinforcement. Just like studying. But hey, what do you expect from someone living at not her real home to do when alone? I mean, I probably will still watch YouTube all day lol Hana-chan has perseverance at least haha not in running she doesn't. Anyways, another wonderful episode, and I like how it's trying to give us the relaxed yet somewhat rollercoaster feeling, despite keeping it being in a very small range. Now I can truthfully say I've not regretted picking up this series. I'm just here for the story and the jokes btw hehe<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mD7hICc2vBI/WmQE3XKAyFI/AAAAAAAAkfU/zKXNoJzoe_YWdkAdW1SdUE3g3Vh2Mh89wCLcBGAs/s320/slowstart03_harem.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">THERE IS YURI IN THIS??? lol Eiko please don't</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Eiko is like "I bought something for your aunt" and I immediately thought of boob cream lol does that even exist?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />P.P.S. "What do you do in your free time?" I mean, it's some maiden's secret or something, isn't it? (lol what were YOU thinking haha SOMEONE GIVE ME SOME HANA-CHAN HENTAI!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> though I have a feeling there's more Eiko hentai than Hana-chan lol)<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">O-MA-KE- Oh you know haha</blockquote><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o4h715o-nKk/WmQHnN_JnAI/AAAAAAAAkfg/YE12Sva5wZouCYdXFsiw3XOCGHitT06kwCLcBGAs/s1600/slowstart03_harem.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is going to replace my Facebook pokes haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote>I'll skip this for now because I'm trying to clear a little something I would like to refer to as "Mafia III". More about it next week maybe if I can finish it, ignoring all schoolwork lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week was a good week to welcome out first set of releases, and more as I start to open up to giving songs. NICO Touches The Walls released an EP last year (not the one that I missed before that) in December and I took a listen and liked it, actually. I guess it's not quite what I liked, but I can take it so that's good news. Okay, this week's releases. I haven't gotten my hands on yanaginagi's new album so that will have to wait. Fortunately Kotobuki Minako's new album arrived on time, and I guess I gave quite a few of them since I'm fine with them anyway. Still, I still miss Minako Rock, no matter what happens. Remember the legend that was her first album? *sigh* Anyways. I also took a listen to mol-74 new mini-album, and I guess I can give a song or two, but to be honest I'm not a fan of the vocals which will prove to be a problem as I struggle to give melodies while trying to tolerate that high pitched voice. Then again I gave the one song last year and it's also like that. I guess the melody's more important? Oh well.<br /><br />There aren't anything next week so I'll be scouting for new songs, as usual. Well, if I have the mood to anyway. More on my life update on the last paragraph that no one will read lol<br /><br /><br /><br />That's it for now. I want to finish that game by today (I WANT TO REBUILD SAMMY'S BAR!!) (Ugh I don't think I can finish it) so I'll be done for now. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I'll be doing my project (lol) and/or my timetable will be a satisfying three-day school week. Until then.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
