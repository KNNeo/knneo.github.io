<p dir="ltr"><b>So long as we can give it on face value, it doesn't matter how much we have given.</b></p><p dir="ltr">This can be applied to almost everything in life that you like or are okay with, but I thought of this in context for idols. For example, it's hard to reject the one image of him or her and say it's terrible when you know who he or she looks like. Seriously, image editing may be killing our reality for beauty. So literally, I'm talking about "face" value.</p><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
