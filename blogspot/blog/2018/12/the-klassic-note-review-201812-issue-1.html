<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2018.12 Issue 1</h2>
This is what happens when you try to make room for the huge number of posts you're going to do disced reviews on and now it's all digital releases and thanks to Klassic Note you can only review those that I gave the full tracklist. Hey, never wished to be a paid music reviewer though, but if I ever get to...<br /><br />Okay, the wait is over!! The last review of the year is... Mocho? And it's a single from last year? Am I crazy or what? You bet I am. Dissatisfaction brought me this far, to be honest. Less talk, more review, guys let's get to it!<br /><br />This should've been given last year, by the way. *insert Mocho emoticon here*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Asakura Momo - Tokubetsu Ichiban!! [Single]<br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="cboxPhoto" src="https://img.hmv.co.jp/image/jacket/400/77/5/6/229.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200"/></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="cboxPhoto" src="https://img.hmv.co.jp/image/jacket/400/77/5/6/231.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200"/></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="cboxPhoto" src="https://img.hmv.co.jp/image/jacket/400/77/5/6/232.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="200"/></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(With all those balloons and an Anime credit, you know this girl has something on her hehe)<br /><br />Origin: For those who aren't familiar with this girl, let me introduce. She is Asakura Momo, member of TrySail, is a voice actress of some Anime you may know of, and a total klutz. That last one, I take it very seriously. As for her music career as with every other MusicRay's artist who passed that audition, she also got her own, and thus far has been focused on displaying her cuteness to all. For me, it has been a long time coming. At least, in Klassic Note, this single has been in the eserved space for like almost a year. Why? We shall talk about it. How? Now this is mostly because of the disappointment of not seeing this single in full as recurring tracks (producers tend to recycle their topic songs from singles and put them in albums so they can also write less songs, and also to form a wholesome package) which makes me wonder why that one song has been left out. This will be our conversation for this review, but let's talk about what makes her great too.<br /><br /><br />(1) Tokubetsu Ichiban!!<br />Lively, bubbly, energetic, and a total kids' favourite I hope, this song's got everything you want out of a pop idol. Ever since hearing this theme song and watching the Anime "PriPri Chii-chan" (in the Anime Edition it's that yellow thing) I have always liked this song, and the full song did not disappoint, which made me even happier to give this song without hesitation. A simple melody, catchy mood and feel, and easy to give song structure. This one goes right up the Klassic Note alley. The overall feel of it though? Maybe not so much. As much as this song has all the ticks, it also feels kind of haphazard where the music producers just dump a bunch of depth into a song to buff it up, probably to cover the novice singer's talent so that I won't be the perfectionist as I am. But hey, for this I won't complain. The music video is also a charmer as she plays with more of those balloons which make me really happy for some reason, and I'm sure it'll make you happy too. Those antics of hers never get me bored.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">As stupid as this looks, this is pretty great! (●･▽･●)<br /><br />Must be a "first" for Asakura Momo, in many "special" ways. Happy birthday, Mocho. <a href="https://t.co/85u4wfrfMK">pic.twitter.com/85u4wfrfMK</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/878826742701473792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> Rating: 4 stars (Above Anime Average)<br /><br />(2) Hakoniwa Borderline [Box Garden Borderline]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Inside the box garden, gazing at the sky singing (a) song as (I'm) alone</div><div style="text-align: center;">(I'm) sure, (I'm) sure, it'll get through"</div></blockquote>Now this is where we explain its existence in the shelf. Maybe it's just me, but June 2017 me from last year wasn't kind. And maybe I was thrown off by her first single which was a technically a cover single and this came by, and I decided to not give it, and if I ever did it'll be from the album. Well, at least, that was what I thought. Fast forward a year and her album released in October 2018, and this song isn't up there. Weird, I say, as the only thing I would give this song was actually on its unique take with a fantasical feel and a mellow mood complimenting Asakura Momo's singing. Literally out of spite, I seek out this single to review it again, and wow did I regret not giving it last year. Likely what would deter anyone from this song maybe its aggression in providing you with this feel along with sometimes high-pitched singing, and that abrupt of a bridge in the song structure, but other than that, I can't even find fault. As usual, you need to have the mood to give such a beautiful song.<br />Rating: 4 Stars (Beautifully Average)<br /><br /><br />Conclusion: This is a wonderful single. I couldn't ask much. Maybe I asked too much of it last year due to stricter requirements, but I've toned down. I've realised how much of a lovely single this has turned out to be out of all her releases thus far. I recommend you give her a chance even if you aren't interested in Anime music as I'm sure the B-side will surprise you. If you know of her, I recommend you give it a listen if you want to jump right into her... music. She is lovely too, but lovely music makes of a lovely artist. And I'll take both.<br /><br />(o･∇･o)<br /><br />- Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br /><br />(Wow, I was real aggressive in the single, yes? I hope Mocho doesn't mind I'm just speaking my mind it's the end of the year anyways haha)<br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N1wwEJQQM30/XA5xZAJtgWI/AAAAAAAAsWY/0T9wrM5Mt4gYs0L4NO1QIuapAjChV_NfACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181210_210308.jpg" width="320" /></div>Well first things first: I got a better phone camera to prepare for next year, yes? I just hope it's not five releases like this year. Man, this is really pathetic, eh? I mean, last year's got TWICE the reviews, people. TWICE!! (Okay, stop the Korean promotions here haha)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-euN5NVmHLtQ/XA5xcnAF21I/AAAAAAAAsWg/TRxN6wC4Y58P6V_vmARru2924yaFD5rEACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181210_211630.jpg" width="320" /></div>Okay, the release. If you have seen these stuff before, you shouldn't be surprised to see her in every corner of the package, from the in-sleeve, the booklet and the case itself. And of course, since I did not pre-order or order early after release to any extent, I'm not getting any bonuses. Sorry, Mocho. I hesitated. Which is also good news, because that means I didn't resort into going to an auction site and buying it at a reduced price because I love wasting money lol. (No really, the shipping on those auction sites are literally daylight robbery) (Mocho, you aren't worth this much) (I'm talking about music here too by the way) So yeah, I missed out of this much. It's okat. Music takes time to get into you. And this one, maybe a little too long. My self consolation is not going to help haha<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-u52OjHsPlvU/XA5xgeIWu_I/AAAAAAAAsWk/G3g2izRfPC4bPhAGK9OIE3D29f9ucgYPACLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20181210_210427.jpg" width="320" /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />This is all then. I'll update on Honda-san if I can remember watching it. Otherwise you'll be glad to know my worklife is going to get a whole lot more busy, and I'm out of the country for the weekend in like, at least 5 years I believe. *laughs* Hope I don't get another virus I can only take that much antibiotics haha cya guys later<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
