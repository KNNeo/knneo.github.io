Oh I haven't typed the intro? Who needs it? Okay, I better tease you on it then. It's not NSFW.<br /><br />See? Some already turned away. They didn't see the "not" word. Then again, everyone would have already turned away because I'm boring and my reviews probably are too. <span title="*sob*">😢</span><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>ACCA 13th District </b>(so that it sounds iconic): Hey, another week, another ACCA. Damn I shouldn't say that, but there is development, even if it's not that significant.<br />This new episode (2) talks more about the potential rebellion within the organisation, and the big five have also heard of it. Jean apparently is the (un)likely accomplice/mastermind of whatever sort, but besides that we don't know. They have requested an undercover spy to check on him on their behalf, and guess what? It's his friend who he's known for decades. Oh well, who better else? Anyways, from my perspective I believe it is unlikely, but then again who knows? There's potential for a sabotage, there may still be people to help him (like that woman superior he keeps bumping into at the same bread shop) along the way, so why not? Also, the sister is cute. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And I'm not some rookie who cannot pass the ACCA test. I'm not even there anyway.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j5jAnxVD844/WH9aHVWSvfI/AAAAAAAAdFY/BL6xLGCDoWoj9-2df1-jAmnxo1AYNRcVgCLcB/s320/acca02_lunch.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">More shocks at their best (in animation quality lol).<br />The agriculture there reminds me heavily of Nagasarete Airantou haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Kuzu no Honkai:</b> Well well, look what we've got yet again.<br />This episode (2) talks about (yes, one more to go lol) Hanabi-chan mostly, and how she sees romance. Apparently not so much, and somehow described by her classmates who want to consult her on romance, she has a very similar situation as someone else. But instead of hopelessly loving someone who she has stuck with for a long time (unrequited, of course) she chose someone else and in some sense "betray" her feelings against someone she really love. Hey, I may not be a professional here, but I'm at Hanabi's perspective and like "I'm the one who chose the Senpai path!" kind of thought right there. Nonetheless, things get real complicated considering two other people in the... I don't know what shape you want to call it. There's a childhood friend of Mugi who thinks can get in the way of the "real" couple lol and there's the other who is into girls. Nothing wrong with that, but if you watch the cliffhanger at the back her crush is on her girl friend Hanabi. Girlfriend by next week probably lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9rr1wIvkZpE/WIRSUbp1uwI/AAAAAAAAd2c/LopIbLwnLMU96bq3T1ZSlMnVneNvLWK0QCLcB/s320/Kuzu%2Bno%2BHonkai%2B-%2B02%2B-%2BLarge%2B31.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The girl who asked Hanabi for advice.<br />Which would you choose? Honestly, I'll take the right, as a man haha</td></tr></tbody></table>Damn, I really wonder I'll even continue watching this show. As mentioned in <a href="http://randomc.net/2017/01/21/kuzu-no-honkai-02/comment-page-1/#comment-2253923" target="_blank">Random Curiosity</a> before I came here, I really hate the idea I'm looking away from the show. This doesn't even happen in the other two shows I watch this season. Sorry noitamina, may not be cut out this season after all.<br />P.S. Been looking at other references of this *fantastic* show in terms of the just on air <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/L4Fw6Z20IRY" target="_blank">drama series</a>&nbsp; (nothing but making out, <a href="https://srfez.com/XFA683M8X8" target="_blank">if you get to watch it</a>) and the original manga itself. I talked about the latter before, but I went on a few chapters after the first one. The story gets arrranged around a bit, but it's no difference considering the Anime actually quite faithfully followed all the makeout scenes anyway. Well, sucks to be me then, for I may just drop this by next week.<br />P.P.S. The theme songs though... I'll take some 96neko (pronounced Kuroneko) and Sayuri-chan, thank you.<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>Hey, another episode of this show! Damn, makes my own depression far by comparison, really. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />This new episode (14) talks about, you guessed it, his loss. Before he could get eaten up by the lion ahead (I see what I did there), he already lost to someone else before that. Nikaidou is unlikely behind all this, but seeing how Shimada can potentially help him in Kiriyama's future in shougi, we have a chance to see that depressed boy walk his own path. Then again, his depression of being along really kicks in enough to make his body retaliate, the teacher advised him about the workshop the opponent he defeated has opened, and we might see some improvement by then. Yeah, you're right, I'm being REALLY positive about this. After half an episode of sadness, we finally see some light, and I'd like to talk more about it. That's all. It's not like I'm a pessimist or anything like that haha<br />P.S. Two images this week, so show the exaggeration of one expression. Really, Kiriyama can piss anyone off. Besides another depressed person lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_DCRmfYwRnM/WIRbqqHiy_I/AAAAAAAAd2s/PGhNFMjUg1UOw-w8Qg79gpixP4YsRQVpwCLcB/s1600/sangatsunolion14_angry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_DCRmfYwRnM/WIRbqqHiy_I/AAAAAAAAd2s/PGhNFMjUg1UOw-w8Qg79gpixP4YsRQVpwCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion14_angry.jpg" width="320" /></a></td><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JtHkyZQ3GmI/WIRbrRlwh_I/AAAAAAAAd2w/_7QfDiVeQ2EOIr3YcOvLCr8NJqLCj_4ugCLcB/s1600/sangatsunolion14_pissed.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JtHkyZQ3GmI/WIRbrRlwh_I/AAAAAAAAd2w/_7QfDiVeQ2EOIr3YcOvLCr8NJqLCj_4ugCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion14_pissed.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Kuroshitsuji: </b>And yes, we're close to yet another conclusion. You know I like a solved mystery.<br />This latest chapter (125) really talks a lot about the plot, after Sebastian allowed the news stand to just publish the photo out front. Also, if you want me to draw parallel differences to modern medicine today, please read up on blood types and blood transfusion. So, firstly, things we already knew that the Scotland Yard will take years to find out otherwise. There is an obvious lack of supply of a specific type of blood, and if you did learn some <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-types" target="_blank">blood types</a>&nbsp;you'd know the least amount of blood that exists in the world currently is now the AB blood type, which is likely also the Sirius type as mentioned in Bravat's terms. And if you need more without reading it up yourself, it's because blood type talk about proficiency and deficiency of specific types of chemicals inside one's blood, and AB just happens to be the one that has both missing (A and B), with O being the most common and most usable blood type. This has got to do with blood transfusion as mentioned by Ciel too as blood transfer has a rejection rate, and with a similar type of blood transfused the rejection rate will decrease. This chapter brings us to who finally needs such a blood supply, namely rich guests who are better off dead anyway, and Bravat has yet to reveal a special guest who needs it most, apparently. (Of course, he/she is likely Sirius blood type) Next chapter will likely be the conclusion I guess, and I can't wait to see that bloke fortune teller and his downfall.<br />P.S. Ah, did not notice people are selling off those stupid star accessories at the pawn shop lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a8io_z0QYAU/WISYyyd1z9I/AAAAAAAAd3E/O6GLymwgSssVNSl0c4zJkw9MeInGxgZWgCLcB/s320/kuroshitsuji124_03.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="297" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Pretty much sums up last chapter lol<br />I'll leave the story-telling details to Ciel, yes?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hmm, not much this week too. But next week... well, also not much too, haha. But there's the holidays, so maybe I'll get some music research going. Or I just open up Apple Music for an hour or two haha<br /><br />Let's just talk about two singles this week then. <b>Takagaki Ayahi's new single</b> reminds me of a (I'm Singaporean btw) National Day Parade theme song about a decade ago lol, and <b>SID's new single</b> for the Kuroshitsuji movie was okay. Talking about the movie which airs in Japan this weekend, I wish I get to watch it already. <a href="https://twitter.com/kuroshitsuji2/status/822277492408889344" target="_blank">The</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/joujinakata123/status/821607472637026305" target="_blank">many</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/kuroshitsuji2/status/822353413706944512" target="_blank">spoilers</a>&nbsp;on their Twitter account are seriously irritating. Haha I'm sorry if you've hit any of them.<br /><br /><br />Cya guys then. I've had enough of this boring week. Next week is definitely going to be exciting as I'm FINALLY going to start on my internship project, and only for half the week haha. Second half of course is the Chinese New Year celebrations which I will no doubt be... I don't know. I'm not in the mood for anything right now, actually. Until next time everyone.
