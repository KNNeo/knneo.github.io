<p dir="ltr">I wonder if anyone would think that <b>overseas experience may be a conversational topic to be avoided</b> because it's never a concensus?</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, maybe it's just me. But thinking just logically, there are people who cannot afford an overseas trip, and digging on it with others kind of gives a segregation from the start. On my personal opinion, there are people like me who do not desire to leave for further exploration. And there's these guys. What do you think that makes me feel? Yeah, that exchange guy is just good lol</p><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
