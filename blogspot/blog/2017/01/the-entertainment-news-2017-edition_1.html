<div style="text-align: center;">***Happy New Year <span style="font-size: xx-small;">(insert fireworks animation here)</span>, everyone! Welcome to 2017!***</div><br />(Man this must look worse on mobile haha)<br />I'm not particularly excited considering I spent last night doing up the Top 20 songs for Klassic Note 2016, and spent the whole of today at a relative's house, you would say I'm rather exhausted already. Promises are still in check though, and with one more week left of my life (lol) because I'll finally be a working adult soon, I hope to finish some things before that starts.<br /><br />Also, no resolutions this year. Just like lat year. Because I can't hold on to them. No sarcasm from social media as comments please. I've seen enough of them already.<br /><br />Also also, no format changes even though it's a new year. I have no mood for this kind of thing lol. I mean, if it were change I'll do it whenever I like, okay? Now let's get started. This is too long of an intro to start an issue of this already.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> Just to not get your hopes too high, and yes I did not miss an episode yet, here's that summary that they've been talking about on Twitter.<br />This special episode (11.5) which, in honesty I didn't watch everything because I know it's this type of thing, is just a good summary of what is going on with Rei's surprisingly hard yet fulfilling life. Hey, I'll take a switch of lives with him. If... I'm good at shougi and I'm not a wuss. (Audience: Woah...) Yeah, anyways, this is just a teaser of what is to come, and personally for me, I'm really forward-looking when it comes to this show (didn't intend to live life twice lol) so I want to see how far the production has taken this show. Hopefully not more chess matches, please.<br />P.S. No images because technically I didn't watch the show. And just watching 20 seconds of that next episode preview doesn't count.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>One Week Friends: </b>Yes, there apparently is a concluding chapter. It (39) talks about their graduation and how things will go after they go their separate ways. Yes, everyone. From Saki-chan, to the classmates, to the main two guys and Fujimiya-san, of course. It's been a heck of a ride, but I wished this was in the Anime.<br />P.S. No images for this because the quality is low haha<br /><br /><b>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san: </b>Damn I wish for the guys to finish this already. The last volume of the series is here, and starting with a chapter (78) very befitting of the season. End of the year. Someone made a Christmas confession to a girl. That girl said yes. That doesn't mean they're going out yet, but they have been going to somewhere. Seeing their foreigner friend out is one thing, but then...? Honestly saying, if Yuuto doesn't do it himself, Kotone will never do anything. And that's important to note. Then again he's doubtful of his actions, so this could take a while. We're not dealing with a tsundere like his friend is haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="162" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fkbnTgAz5oI/WGNn0mYN1FI/AAAAAAAAcdY/kPTmzoq2UAI1goY3E4BYo2fCSvULPPpKQCLcB/s320/kashiwagisan78_love.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yeah technically speaking they are not.<br />Damn all the facial expressions in this story haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />SHOW<br /><b>White Rabbit Project:</b> You guys may not know, but this is also not the return of MythBusters. The build team who left initially are back, it's not all experiments, there's a lot of history telling and fact-checking, it's a Netflix original (WTF if Netflix lol) and so on. In summary, it's them again, making science interesting and fun to just listen to. And watch, because they did do some big feats. Their released first season consist of mind control, a hot air balloon made form propane tanks , a makeshift hoverboard, and more. Hope that's enough to entice you because I don't want to spoil everything. I liked it though, and I think it has potential to carry on. Can't wait for the next season.<br /><br />And yes, I finished watching the whole thing. 10 episodes worth. Which is about 10 hours. Totally worth your time, I would say.<br /><br /><br />And yes, no <b>Klassic Note</b> this week. Mostly due to the <b>results being out</b>! You can find the last year's one (hehe) <a href="http://klassicnoteawards.webs.com/2016" target="_blank"><b>over here</b></a>. Also, I'll be doing up the Evaluation (if you've been waiting for that) tomorrow because... you know.<br /><br />So I end here. A little too short because new Anime haven't appeared, and it's the first day which means I'm still stuck with last year songs, but I'll be catching up. As promised above, I'll do up another post, and hopefully more when I can schedule myself to type out a whole lot of text which only I'll be interested to see in preparation for me listening to Japanese songs for 10 years. Hey, it's commemorative in my opinion. Also, a life landmark, if you would say. So yeah. Also, I hope to finish APoL Chapter 16 to set that pace so I can continue with the arc if possible. Damn, I'm real lazy. Then again, I'm also stuck, so... hope the new year can give me some inspiration, yes? Cya guys next week then, I need to sleep more haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
