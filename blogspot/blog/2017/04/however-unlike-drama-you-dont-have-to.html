<p dir="ltr"><b>However, unlike drama, you don't have to do things that people tell you to do but you don't want to.</b> Welcome to the 21st century, everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Haha, and I don't refer to your shit job or school or whatever you've been doing up till now. I mean in the context of doing the same things together. Listening to the same music (I mean, J-Pop was inexistent when I was in school), watch the same shows, play the same dumb game... You know, entertainment in general. You'll know if you're not the ones forcing others to join what you're playing back then.</p><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
