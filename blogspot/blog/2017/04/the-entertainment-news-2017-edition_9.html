<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #15</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Sunday's going to be Entertainment Day instead of Family Day for me here where I live now my family wants to hang out with me on Saturdays lol<br /><br />But really, I need more time to watch shows and listen to new songs. Somehow weekends are never enough time for me to rest. Especially the new show hype this week. I'm getting tired typing this already haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>(in chronological viewing order because titans suck haha)<br /><b>Eromanga-sensei:</b> Imagine if he didn't sign up for premium so he can watch the livestream in high quality so he could see that note in the video? Yeah this show wouldn't have started haha<br />Hey! It's been a long wait! Well, for me it's about two months since I saw the announcement of Tsukasa-sensei's (the one who wrote this, and Oreimo) new work becoming an Anime, but maybe for many it's even longer. Then again, this show. This show shows promise, for starters. Needless to say if you're bored of the production genre then I can't help haha. But then again we have a collaboration, literally, between the main guy as a light novel author and his stepsister as an illustrator. Hey, it may not be coincidental in every day life, but that sets up quite some premise for this story. Also, the first episode talks a lot about what the back story is all about, because Sagiri was in the family before the mother passed away and through obligation Masamune (really reminds me of a show last season I DIDN'T WATCH lol) has to take care of her because she doesn't want to get out of her room. Out of coincidence too did she decide to livestream in her name and let to find out her real identity as an illustrator. All this is awesome luck and all, but then I think the characters are done well. There's the understanding brother who like to talk weird stuff once in a while and the sister who literally is another tsundere (there's no denying this I swear) but add on her soft-speaking voice and her enthusiasm as a teenager, it's no wonder this story became a hit. I would most definitely stay to watch it down, but if you didn't watch Oreimo (which you should btw) and didn't know the ending I wish this show doesn't end up there. No really, there's family on the line, so use that already.<br />And just so I don't put too much of postscripts for this (sorry for that later) another point to take note here is comedy. Logic triumphs over the jokes that are presented in this show, and I'm impressed. Sagiri-chan (that's what I'm calling her from now haha) for example is a treasure trove full of jokes.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7N2nlylpKT4/WOmo2p2YvuI/AAAAAAAAfHw/2NsMdMM0OrMcsNHyT-hgl5QHn3yyxudpgCEw/s1600/eromangasensei01_sagiri.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7N2nlylpKT4/WOmo2p2YvuI/AAAAAAAAfHw/2NsMdMM0OrMcsNHyT-hgl5QHn3yyxudpgCEw/s320/eromangasensei01_sagiri.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"I thought I would've lost if I leave the room!"<br />But really, come out of the room already lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Totally watching this after I heard a familiar voice that is Komatsu Mikako. Yeah, if you noticed and I'm here to save you the trouble of research, she was Masamune's manager. Hey, I'll take anything. She sounds great!<br />(Okay I noticed I put WAAAAY too many postscripts so here's a summary haha)<br />~ God that girl takes pictures of herself to draw the illustrations I'm glad I'm alive haha<br />~ What are the chances the brother's an author, Sagiri-chan? Definitely higher than you and your pen name lol<br />~ "I don't know anyone by that name" Then change your damn pen name already lol #toomuchtsukkomi<br />~ MVP Masamune-kun because he did all the reactions in view of seeking the truth. Solid comedy right there I laughed a lot<br />~ I had to pause to read the Niyaniya (parody of Niconico which is a thing) stream comments becuase they think Masamune is a schoolgirl and Eromanga-sensei is an old man lol<br />(<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/04/08/eromanga-sensei-01/comment-page-1/#comment-2264297" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>)<br /><br /><b>Alice to Zouroku:</b> Okay just to not throw you off, this is NOT what you think. On the other hand, this story has so much promise... the original work (manga) isn't finished yet. So... yeah. But still.<br />I don't normally watch shows which talk about family like Usagi Drop and stuff (no really, I don't), but this one is one of those that I may end up watching. On the other hand, I have serious doubts about this show because it features a strong premise of magic or supernatural power which will be devastating if not handled properly, in a story perspective. Firstly, the story. We have the main girl who escapes from a research facility (they literally said it out and not leave it to your guessing man) in hopes of taking a deal with some kind person who can help her destroy her place she previously called home? I know it sounds stupid and probably many magic girl stories probably covered such a premise already, but let me elaborate. In this first episode hour special (less than that if you don't watch ads lol) the show covers quite a lot of premise (and reveals so much differently than the manga which I'll talk about later) to give you a good idea of the show. Then again, this show is about modern society, and the old man and his flowers probably are the only thing that will make you feel at home because, I don't like the surveillance cameras type of thing. On other things, the animation is rather cute (no really the old man is cute haha) for all the characters involved, and everything is done quite nicely in terms of pace, not making the show as boring as I might have hoped. On the other hand, I took the liberty of browsing through the first chapter of the manga and it's telling me a lot less things that I would expect from this story. The chase scene is greatly exaggerated for some reason in the Anime, and the twin sisters popped up right in front of Zouroku's car instead of sending him a ball to his face haha. All in all, I think this show maybe worth watching, IF this show is all about the slice-of-life we've witnessed for the last part of the episode. Because I can tell you, I'll hate it if I watch Episode 10 and it's literally a fight scene where the old man's life is in danger or whatever. But then again, at this point I can't even tell you whether I'll take this show or not. I mean, I like it. Just... I'm doubtful.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OW5JnpUlHEk/WOnMbXm430I/AAAAAAAAfH8/CdRta6_a0EsfcxMYUMpQJ_LNYXU0XI-SgCLcB/s320/alicezouroku01_head.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No really she really has little to no manners as a "princess"</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. The girl really knows no manners. Very evidently seen in subtle actions of her to things like not placing her shoes properly when she steps in. I kind of like the girl, if the old man doesn't have a granddaughter we don't know about yet.<br />P.P.S. Let's talk a little more about the action part as I feel I've not talked about it much. In the meeting of the guy in the black suit to a table of guys in black suits (lol), he mentioned about two things. The creator of "Alice's Dream" (probably called Alice I suppose) who created a utopia long time ago who was probably captured by the facility, and the... manifestations (I feel the urge to use the word "minions" lol) that are around and creating stuff easier than us blinking our eyes. So yeah, this supernatural power thing is fascinating and all, but if you're here for this then you may be disappointed. Well, at least after the first episode I assume. It's most definitely not your next action show.<br />P.P.P.S. The ending theme... I'm not that impressed. Although Kotoringo-sensei is probably a name I'm familiar with, so I might try to give the song at some point. We shall see. Also, I'm here because of the opening theme because I've heard ORESAMA and they are perfect for Anime considering their first debut single is the opening theme which I'll get to hear next week. (I don't know them, but remember the ACCA opening theme?)<br /><br /><b>Tsuki ga Kirei: </b>Come on Akane-chan, go squeeze that thing a few more times and you two will be together. On the other hand, give me that so I can stop cringing on this show's plot development lol<br />But no really, this show has promise. I like myself some unrequited romance story once in a while, and this somehow fits quite perfectly. A little different from the romance shows from past seasons because this show doesn't have weird stuff (thanks, Orange Anime), this actually talks about just... life. And I'll take that over anything else, honestly. I'd definitely like to see how this goes, seeing how it is now. Talking about now, let's talk about plot. Akane is your usual middle schooler girl who suddenly notices another guy in her new class at her last year, and so is Kotarou. They probably didn't believe in their super coincidental acquaintances all over the place (because if I had two I'll talk to the girl already) (probably lol), and that may have just brought them closer. It's always Akane taking the initiative in most stuff for this first episode (telling him not to tell others about the restaurant thing, the missing of LINE ID stuff etc.), but I can see why. On the other hand, this show is trying to bring out something, which I may not have felt. Which will bring me to my very first point of this show being potentially very, VERY cringy, enough for me to feel excited about watching this show for the next three months haha. On other things, the animation for walking characters feels a little weird (it's like everyone was in a stop motion video haha), the mood of the audio probably feels a little quiet even though I'm totally fine with it, and the theme songs... let's say they're great in setting the mood for the show, and I'll probably be putting Touyama Nao's debut single on my shelf? Other than that, I'll look forward to the ending. I want to explode with excitement on this show three months down from now haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cpqXwadUg-k/WOnVz7U9kHI/AAAAAAAAfIM/nuPaaVa8VoMTok77ue3m26yztdRK4bezgCLcB/s320/tsukigakieri01_squeezie.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If squeeze three times can talk to a guy, then squeeze more and you'll be getting laid haha<br />Damn, I need to get myself one of these then lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Kotarou should grow a d*ck. I said it. *laughs* Well, in context, I meant he can take that magazine with bikini babes (I know, he thinks it looks like Akane haha) (actually I think it looks like the teacher! OMG), start talking to others already (elaborating on my point above) so he could get laid at some point, and... I'll leave you to imagine many more scenes which I already have cringes for. Remember a boy and a girl in the storeroom? Ah, such is youth... Then again why haven't I been doing that??? That luck of a coincidence I cannot beat; it's called drama haha<br />("Oh I've got dust on my back? Thanks for patting my back! *rubs display panel on chest* Oh I've got it in front too" lololol)<br />P.P.S. If this show doesn't remind you about Sangatsu no Phantasia and the album cover you've seen recently I don't know what will. Then again why didn't Mia-chan sing the theme songs for this? Because it's not the season? haha<br />(I'm going to cringe SOOOO MUCH until Episode 12 I'll get cramps *laughs hard*)<br />(<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/04/07/tsuki-ga-kirei-01/comment-page-1/#comment-2264293" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>)<br /><br /><br />(With this many great shows above it's no wonder I don't want to see people ripped apart lol)<br /><br /><b>Attack on Titan S2:</b> Okay I must not lie, but I did enjoy this episode. I am genuinely touched.<br />In this new episode (27) I told myself so long as I don't see another person got killed I'll be happy. And I'm not disappointed. This feature episode of Sasha, that lady who likes to eat a lot until her father hated her guts (or lack thereof), actually gets to go back to her village to find out what happened on the Titan assault. Turns out everyone is fine because they left, but Sasha managed to save a kid even though her mother now (which was excluded from my assumption at the start haha) is probably beyond saving. Her dad and I are no doubt touched by her bravery and her way to prove her worth as a soldier. But hey, all's well ends well. On the other hand, someone else's village is screwed. Like very screwed. I mean, if a Titan is literally on top of your house you'd be worried.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b4KMaNKDoC4/WOniN4h86oI/AAAAAAAAfIc/IQRLtMDsYgABfWBnC1brGEXTD-vKW0wwgCLcB/s320/attackontitan27_sasha.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is the part where I start saying "she's cool!", really.<br />Also, the music got cued and my eyes start to water at that point too.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Yes I deliberately skipped talking about Eren, the priest and everyone else because Sasha man. She without her gear is fighting braver than all of these wimps. Including that priest. Then again next episode will be a cliffhanger to major spoiler (hopefully) about the truth, so I'll be watching out for that.<br />P.P.S. Okay I may just end up giving the ending theme song. I seriously, SERIOUSLY cannot take the likes of Revo's music.<br /><br />(So <b>in summary</b> I'm holding on to Alice to Zouroku and giving the others. Three episode rule applies too this show I'm not giving... yet.)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>Where got time where you got the Anime section lol. But seriously, there aren't any. That are in line with official translated release, so I'll wait.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>(As a good reminder only this week's reviewed releases will have a tooltip on long press will show album art! Yeah try it out now as you read!)<br />Okay, let's start with what I've missed thus far. Yeah, it's a rough start for April, not long after I paid my yearly subscription for Apple Music. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/80/b3/07/80b30735-d23a-89a1-f4af-6df6cb32d757/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Kuso Iinkai's new album</abbr></b> was nowhere to be found, which is rather disappointing because I anticipated it a lot and now I'm still waiting to listen to it. I'm also not listening to <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/33/df/75/33df7561-2f05-3e8a-6016-fc4c988307f3/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Minase Inori's new album</abbr></b> this week because... well the intro of this post is half the reason already, so I shouldn't elaborate. Now we can talk about what I DID listen. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music82/v4/13/ff/a4/13ffa495-9172-aa28-9682-e7fa41622a64/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Chatmonchy's new single</abbr></b> is pretty okay, really okay until you compare that to the real disappointment that is <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/56/6b/77/566b772b-7c3a-f3af-1df7-ede29bbfe1d6/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Kalafina's new single</abbr></b>. Damn, I'm missing out already. I also took a listen to <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/73/27/15/732715c6-fee8-d93a-a010-176a37d777cf/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Natsukawa Shiina's first single</abbr></b>... and I only ended up giving her B-sides because Nan-chan sounds totally great on those instead.&nbsp;I'm also giving <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/af/24/ba/af24ba96-fe9c-7b72-bc07-2d82fedf9dad/source/170x170bb.jpg" />LILI LIMIT's new song</abbr></b> and I've also listened to <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/15/6e/a9/156ea90c-36f0-0dd4-b7ce-b618fd8a0de1/source/170x170bb.jpg" />SPYAIR's new single</abbr></b> which I totally missed last week for some reason, but don't worry, I got you guys on that haha. To add on, I gave a couple more songs from <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/f9/70/71/f97071e5-5c9b-c099-089e-fc9e8c12d4c2/source/170x170bb.jpg" />amazarashi's best album</abbr></b> including the new song which I think is sub-par compared to many I've given including his earlier songs, but hey, whatever comes in to Klassic Note, man. Yeah, that was a lot of songs to give this week, and I'm not done yet.<br /><br />Next week is going to be quite quiet so that's good because as mentioned above I'm waiting to review a couple of albums. On the other hand, next week is also the week where all the Anime theme songs will get announced and previewed at some point (ClariS and TrySail have surfaced their new songs already), so I'll be on the lookout on that. Be sure to check out my Twitter for details. No really, everything I liked with a link is either an image you'll like or a video you can watch. Including <b>TrySail's new music video</b>.<br /><br />On other news, (I'm referring to my Twitter likes now) S<b>ambomaster's new single is going to be released next week</b> (oops I forgot) following their new album next month, <b>Yoru no Honki Dance has released their new music video</b> for their new single due end of the month, and if you ever get to watch <b>ClariS new music video</b>... don't say I didn't tell you: you get to see them in person. *shock* Without a tall person to compare to I have a feeling they're either real tall or really short lol (also thanks to someone on YouTube Clara is the one with the pink shade; features include her hair accessories)<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Yep, it's them all right. But which one was Clara again?<br /><br />ClariS new music video features themselves.<br />No more 2D, no more CG.

I'm tired already and I need to start thinking of my work schedule for next week. (Yeah I'm that bored I need to occupy myself so I don't burn out) Cya guys then, and until next time... I feel tired already. Thinking about work. Two more months. I got to go through this. Sometimes I feel like my work is really devalued. Or less appreciated. Because it isn't that important. I feel like I'm doing up work for something that is totally optional in a project. Yeah. I'm screwed. This is not motivation at all. *sigh* Bye.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
