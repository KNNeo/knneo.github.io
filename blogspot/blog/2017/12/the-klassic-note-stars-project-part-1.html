<h2>The Klassic Note "Searching Stars Project" Part 1</h2>
I know it's just me finding out what most (if not, all) the artists are doing now so I can find new songs haha, but yeah that's pretty much it.<br /><br />In here, as part of the #KN10YEARS series (I'm not going to use that tag officially to any extent btw) I shall explore all the artists I've at least given a song to and find out what got me started, and what they have been doing now, as well as a couple of little snippets I can share up till this point. First things first - it's all text, so if this bores you, so search for the artist images if you want lol. Anyways, it'll be done in four parts (hopefully, if not more) and I'll try to cover as many as I can, of course, excluding the artists whom I've given in 2017. The list shall follow the one from Hall of Fame (if you don't know that's a thing yet go to the <a href="http://klassicnote.strikingly.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>), and shall be done in the following 5W1H format: [unless stated otherwise, in square brackets]<br /><ul><li><b>Who</b> are they [for the sake of convenience I shall include Japanese names]</li><li><b>What</b> was their best impression thus far/back then</li><li><b>When</b> I started</li><li><b>Where</b> did it get lost, if I did [Does not apply to active artists]</li><li><b>Why</b> I will still care [Don't care may apply to inactive artists or one-hit wonders]</li><li><b>How</b> are they doing now: The good, the bad, and whatever applies to them today</li></ul><br />[*Information accurate as of 2017.12.09]<br />Let's get started then!<br /><br /><br />UVERworld<br /><ul><li>Back then in 2007 they were just a rock band as far as I can remember</li><li>The only one song that was on my list, "D-tecnolife" as part of Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song. That song left an impression.</li><li>They were in from 2007 thanks to "BLEACH" which was part of the first list of songs in Klassic Note</li><li>Stopped because it's just a one-hit wonder, and back then I did not put much emphasis on them since there were many artists around from the start</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They're doing pretty good, if you have been following them. I probably don't care now because they have changed style. Drastically. I mean, they're called "fusion band" now? What the heck is that??</li></ul>Rie fu<br /><ul><li>Singer, songwriter, both, inspiring artist for the least common J-Pop</li><li>Hmm... best of her was probably back when her series of singles leading up to her album "URBAN ROMANTIC" in 2009. Still the highest reviewed album in the 10 years I've followed her</li><li>Started from 2007, thanks to Anime "BLEACH" on her first ending theme song</li><li>[Active Artist]</li><li>I care because I like her own style of music, mostly. She also sings English songs which makes her relevant to be an English singer too in Klassic Note</li><li>She's toured Asia and UK for the past few years (still my biggest regret to not see her live, for free), and is staying in UK to release songs in English and J-Pop once in a while, so yeah, she's pretty much alive</li></ul>Younha [ユンナ]<br /><ul><li>(South) Korean born singer, songwriter maybe, at this point actress I don't know</li><li>Japanese songs were her best? Yeah, of course her best was from Anime "BLEACH" when she sings the ending theme; Her period of activity from 2008-2010 is a close second</li><li>Started from 2007 thanks to "BLEACH"</li><li>Stopped because she is now active in K-Pop industry which means her coming back is unlikely. I've been proven wrong before though.</li><li>I care because of her great singing voice, if anyone wants to agree with me, which shows how much she is still active, at least as a singer</li><li>She's active in K-Pop since... 2011-2012? Yeah, and did show intention for her return to J-Pop releasing a mini-album in 2014, but not ever since</li></ul>HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR<br /><ul><li>Rock band, focusing on punk rock most of the time</li><li>This one is tough, but my best impression was a B-side song back in 2008 called "Hanafubuki", which is coincidentally their disbandment single (more on that later)</li><li>From 2007, thanks to Anime "BLEACH" once again</li><li>Stopped due to disbandment (more below)</li><li>I'll care because I missed their music style, and want to hear more before they can be always in my list. Sadly, that didn't last long.</li><li>They disbanded in 2008 following a new formation with a replaced vocalist, but that didn't last long too. Fully disbanded in 2010 after their final single</li></ul>Horie Yui [堀江由衣]<br /><ul><li>Anime artist, voice actress, idol (one of the longest-living at this point)</li><li>This one maybe hard, but anything that has her singing romance songs is always a joy to listen, from Anime "Toradora!" to "Golden Time"</li><li>Started from 2007, from Anime "Love Hina" if I didn't remember wrongly, and more significantly in 2008 from Anime "Toradora!" with an ending and opening theme song</li><li>I've not gotten that far to forget about her yet</li><li>Yes, just her cute voice and how well she fits into singing. As always, voice actors make good singers. Just, only for Anime songs.</li><li>She's doing pretty good; she released her anniversary live release in 2017, but her latest single was back in 2015 though, so (as a singer) she's still fairly active?&nbsp;</li></ul>YUI<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter on the streets, picked up by major label and instantly became a J-Pop sensation in the past decade</li><li>This is really hard tbh, so all of her songs</li><li>Started from 2007, again, from Anime "BLEACH" with ending theme "LIFE" and then opening theme "Rolling star"</li><li>She stopped, not me</li><li>Her unique voice coupled with her own pop music style over the years did capture my attention consistently</li><li>She's not doing great tbh because she stopped her solo career in 2012 (it's a dark story so go find out yourself) and came back in 2014 with self-established band "FLOWER FLOWER" and has been semi-active since</li></ul>Aqua Timez<br /><ul><li>Pop-rock band, distinctive in singing songs with own unique style and sophisticated, lengthy lyrics</li><li>Their early days are literally the best which covered up till 2012 for me as I explore their songs from when they started</li><li>Started from 2007, following Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song and more notably for Anime "BLEACH Movie" theme song</li><li>Can't stop, won't stop</li><li>Because they are real good. They symbolize a style which I identify in Klassic Note, and will always change and continue to impress</li><li>They've not done much since their newest album in 2016, but still impressive as I continue to grab songs from their new song lists</li></ul><div>Takacha [タカチャ]</div><div><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, focusing on pop and rap music</li><li>His theme song from Anime "BLEACH" was good</li><li>From 2007, Anime "BLEACH"</li><li>I guess I kind of stopped since 2011 when I gave his mini-album topic song "Omae wa Ore no Taiyou"</li><li>His style is good, I guess, but it doesn't really stay inside me, so I didn't give more. Also, he's not that active of an artist</li><li>He's still releasing new songs as far as I can see on his Twitter, but focusing on backstage and DJ production, so... maybe not?</li></ul></div>Kishidan [氣志團]<br /><ul><li>Rock band, but if you think they look like one you should notice they are</li><li>Their only one song which had a deep-rooted impression way before Klassic Note started should not be mentioned of (lol)</li><li>From 2007, with their (way too) popular song "One Night Carnival"</li><li>It was kind of a hit and miss, and honestly I don't enjoy any form of rapping from them</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They are still active, in case you wonder, going on lives and actively performing. Releasing songs? Not so much. Their last single was dated 2015 though.</li></ul>Koda Kumi [倖田來未]<br /><ul><li>Singer for generic pop songs, also popular in the past decade</li><li>Impression was only left on the first song I remembered giving in Klassic Note</li><li>From 2007, with song "Koi no Tsubomi"</li><li>I didn't stop as to say not interested, as I mentioned all the time I do not like to support very popular artists, and the song was just the one</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She's still active in the industry despite starting at the start of the new millennium; She released at least two albums and two singles in 2017, so that's really active</li></ul>Hoshimura Mai [星村麻衣]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter for pop songs, sometimes solo pianist</li><li>Impression from the only song I have ever given from her, also Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song</li><li>From 2007, along with the first batch of "BLEACH" theme songs I gave</li><li>She didn't really fascinate me with her compositions or music style per se, and hearing generic pop won't get her on the list seeing the competition (refer to Ikimonogakari)</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She has changed music labels and settled on one which supports her music composition (ie. not major label) since 2010. Her image has changed too, and she released a new single in 2017 and is her second since her best album (since 2010) released in 2014</li></ul>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION<br /><ul><li>Rock band, focusing on alternative rock even though present day I feel otherwise</li><li>This is going to be hard considering they have many great hits, but specifically from 2008-2010 are their best in my opinion</li><li>From 2007, along with their first song from Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song "After Dark"</li><li>I'm just waiting for new songs right here, not that re-release of that 2nd album... (see below)</li><li>I care because of their unique rock music style, even though now I would say otherwise mainly because of the transitions swaying a lot more compared to artists I know of like Aqua Timez. Vocalist and composer Masafumi Gotoh solo career in 2014 has helped change the band's feel and style, and not really for the better</li><li>They are doing well recently, but for this year they only released one single, following last year's re-release of one of their singles "Re:Re" and their original 2nd album back in 2004 "Sol-fa"</li></ul>BEAT CRUSADERS<br /><ul><li>Rock band focusing some om punk rock, but mostly generic rock</li><li>Impression from the only song given which is also Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song</li><li>From 2007, along with first batch of "BLEACH" theme songs</li><li>I just don't feel with their rock style, seeing their image (search their profile images online) and me not feeling much for their other songs</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They have officially disbanded by the end of 2010 with a final album</li></ul>Chatmonchy [チャットモンチー]<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock band turned two-piece, playing generic and alternative rock</li><li>This is hard as usual since I've heard them for many years, but their releases from 2009-2010 are the best I suppose</li><li>From 2007, with first song given in Anime "BLEACH" ending theme, setting underwhelming first impressions</li><li>They stopped, not me (refer below)</li><li>I care because they are one of those that I can identify with in music style, along with lyrics that are emotional</li><li>As of 2017 they have announced their disbandment after releasing a final album in 2018. They have been fairly unstable since the drummer left in 2011, leaving them to themselves in 2012, joining with other partner bands from 2013-2015, and returning back to two-piece band since late 2016. It has been rough, but still fairly active as long as Klassic Note is concerned</li></ul>HOME MADE Kazoku [HOME MADE 家族]<br /><ul><li>Rap band focusing on rap songs and pop songs</li><li>It's a long runner here already, and to be honest they haven't been spectacular, but I particularly enjoyed their releases from 2009-2011</li><li>From 2007, with first batch of Anime "BLEACH" theme songs</li><li>They stopped later than I thought, to say the least</li><li>I care because it's one of the few (second to Lil'B, will mention below) artists which I appreciate their rapping in music. Most of the others I just avoid or ignore</li><li>As of 2016 they have disbanded and have moved on their own paths. No solo activity yet as of now as they focus (in their 40s) on music-related activities and back-end production as far as I know and seeing from their Twitter account which is still constantly updated</li></ul>Ikimonogakari [いきものがかり]<br /><ul><li>Pop band with two male composers and a female vocalist</li><li>They are already honorary members of Klassic Note already like some others, so don't ask. They release like, an album a year on their active years too, so it'll be heard to choose.</li><li>From 2007, with first song from Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "HANABI"</li><li>Quiet doesn't mean stopped, okay?</li><li>I care because they are underrated outside of the country, to say the least. Their lack of exposure to overseas performance coupled with their compositions to pop music keeps me hooked</li><li>As of 2016 they released their anniversary best album which I have reviewed before (be sure to check that out), and have been quiet in 2017. I hope it's not bad news. They are slated to release a vinyl compilation of all their albums in early 2018 though.</li></ul>JUNE<br /><ul><li>(South) Korean-based pop singer, dabbles in music composition</li><li>His only song in Klassic Note which is also Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song</li><li>From 2007, with only song "Baby It's You" in Klassic Note</li><li>I stopped, because it's only the one song. Besides, not a big fan of soul-based songs back then in 2007-2008</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>As of now (according to his official website) he's a song producer and writer for many groups in Japan and (South) Korea especially, starting from joining as a vocalist in group "WAZZ UP" in 2011, going to military conscription in 2015 as hiatus and came back in 2017 to continue to write new songs</li></ul>ORANGE RANGE<br /><ul><li>Pop-rap group focusing on hype-up songs and rap mostly</li><li>Their only song which is also first theme song to Anime "BLEACH" was my first and best impression thus far</li><li>From 2007, with the one song I gave "Asterisk"</li><li>Didn't delve much further since I didn't like their style much, and rap is out of my league especially when you notice there are groups like HOME MADE Kazoku</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>As of 2017 they have released new songs, are active in yearly live performances. Started on their own run label 2010 (it's common these days tbh) and has since then been actively producing and writing their own tunes, 2017 was their 15th anniversary and they are slated to go on tour after their new release in two years in November</li></ul>ORESKABAND [オレスカバンド]<br /><ul><li>Six-piece jazz band focusing on rock and jazz songs</li><li>Their best impression has got to be (in no order of bias) their first song I gave which came with the Anime tie-in (of which you should be familiar, will mention below) and their two mini-albums from 2008-2009 which showed off their style of music as basis</li><li>From 2007, with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Tsumasaki"</li><li>Can't stop, won't stop</li><li>I care because they are a rarity. Hardly you'll walk into the streets to see their popularity soar especially in overseas as they travel the world to find out they have large audiences in the West. Their initial focus on rock music also attracted me to their style of music, though their balance to include brass instruments is also vital to their identity</li><li>As of this year they released their first 7-inch EP "Groovin' Work Stylee" after their new album in end of 2016 "Slogan". This was after their leaving of the major label around 2014, and changing of one of the members in 2016 following departure due to pregnancy reasons</li></ul>Skoop On Somebody<br /><ul><li>Soul and R&amp;B duo also writing pop songs and soul music</li><li>Their only impression was from Anime "BLEACH"</li><li>From 2007, with "BLEACH" theme song "happypeople"</li><li>I didn't continue on their journey because they are highly inactive even back then, and even so their melodies didn't hit me as much</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>They have been steadily releasing new songs since their departure from major label with a new album in 2017, which also marks the group's 20th anniversary</li></ul>SunSet Swish<br /><ul><li>Three-piece J-Pop band focusing on pop songs</li><li>Their best impression is likely their first song in Klassic Note thanks to Anime tie-in once again</li><li>From 2007, with Anime "BLEACH" theme song "My Pace"</li><li>It was kind of on and off before their disbandment and hiatus (refer below), and even so I didn't find no reason to give them another chance as I place more songs on my list</li><li>I care because they represent a different voice in J-Pop industry, and it's hard to find a male group which sounds this good on their own, writing their own songs</li><li>They have announced disbandment in 2011 which then bounced back in 2015 when they suddenly announced a return in late 2015 with a digital single, but have since gone quiet in releases and focusing on performing lives</li></ul>Tsuji Ayano [つじ あやの]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, producer, ukulele player, among many other stuff she does</li><li>Her only impression for her own performance was from Movie "The Cat Returns" theme song</li><li>From 2007, with "The Cat Returns" theme song "Kaze ni Naru"</li><li>Her vocals may be the biggest turn-off for following her releases, despite her excelling in composition and production behind the scenes for other artists throughout the years</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She has since left major label and focused on solo activities and writing for other artists. Her solo dated album was in 2010 and her last single was dated 2008</li></ul>(Can we skip the next few artists? No?)<br /><br />=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!=======<br />Hirose Koumi [広瀬香美]<br /><ul><li>Anime artist for early days Anime in the 90s, also composer and producer</li><li>[One Hit Wonder, so impressions, first song and how long it lasted applies]</li><li>She concluded (I did not mention disbandment) her solo career with a best album in 2012 shortly after running her own live streams and singing new songs for the then 2011 earthquake in the name of charity. She has been actively writing songs for artists ever since.</li></ul>Kimura Yumi [木村弓]<br /><ul><li>Solo artist famous for Anime works, productions, and her skillful performance of the lyre</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She works with Miyazaki on Studio Ghibli films (which is the only song I gave), and is fairly active in writing songs and music and performance with her lyre on music stages</li></ul>GUMI<br /><ul><li>Solo artist, singer-songwriter and very active Anime producer and writer</li><li>[One Hit Wonder, and is also hers (see below)]</li><li>She has only used this artist name in Anime "Cardcaptor Sakura", and has used her producer name "meg rock" ever since, and is an active player in the Anime music industry as I've seen that name pop up many times. Under this name she has released a couple of Anime releases until 2011, and has been focused in music production since</li></ul>Hayashibara Megumi[林原めぐみ]<br /><ul><li>Voice actress, Anime singer, sometimes lyricist</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She has been very active in the Anime music industry it seems, and as of 2017 she released a single and an album. Impressive for someone who started in the 90s and is still fairly active today. Remember the only one who was in this list like her is Horie Yui.</li></ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br /><br /><br />KELUN<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock band focusing on generic rock</li><li>Their best impression was in 2008 where their single with Anime tie-in and album left a good impression</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "BLEACH" opening theme song "CHU-BURA"</li><li>I didn't stop, they did it first</li><li>I actually care because at that point I want more.&nbsp;</li><li>They ended their activities in late 2009 after their first full album in 2008 (yeah), and has since gone quiet</li></ul>KOTOKO<br /><ul><li>Anime singer, sometimes Anime song lyricist and to a less extent composer and producer</li><li>Her best impression was from 2008 in her singing of Anime "Shakugan no Shana" theme songs</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "Shakugan no Shana" opening theme song "being"</li><li>I kind of didn't follow through since she was less than active recently, and before that I'm not a crazy fan of beat-based pop tunes</li><li>I care because I like her unique singing voice, and coupled with the right songs it'll make her great (eg. Anime "Shakugan no Shana" theme songs she has done once per season)</li><li>She has been focusing on lyric writing for some time already, but as a solo artist she is fairly active in collaboration and releasing songs under her own name once in a while. In 2017 I gave a song she sang at Anisama live event titled "unfinished" and released back in 2012</li></ul>Kawada Mami [川田まみ]<br /><ul><li>Anime singer-songwriter, sometimes Anime lyricist and composer, maybe producer</li><li>Her best impression wasn't really on her first, but in 2008 another theme song from Anime "Shakugan no Shana" hit my heart with an emotional song titled "Akai Namida"</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "Shakugan no Shana" opening theme song "Hishoku no Sora"</li><li>She stopped earlier than I thought she should</li><li>I care because I liked her singing voice, even though like KOTOKO she suffers from the same problem of producing Anime songs, so those beats will not get to me as I don't prefer them. Though through the years, she has sung more variety of songs compared to the former</li><li>She has announced a stop to her solo singing activities with a final album in 2016 and has since and even before, write songs and lyrics for dozens of Anime artists, not and including for KOTOKO, among many others. She is slated to be one of the future prospective Anime producers in the industry too</li></ul>Lil’B aka MIE&amp;AILA<br /><ul><li>Pop and rap music duo, famous for Anime tie-ins</li><li>Their best impression overall is in romance songs sung outside of Anime theme songs typically, with most prominent in 2008 "Kimi ni Uttata Love Song"</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Orange"</li><li>They stopped, and I'll tell you why later</li><li>I care because I missed them. A lot. I'm not even joking. Their unique position in the music industry makes them most palatable for my tastes in Klassic Note and despite less than high impressions, they make of something to remember for the long run</li><li>They have announced hiatus following rapper AILA pursue for higher education (ie. university) and has since been a solo thing featuring singer MIE running her own performances. She released an album in 2013 under the group name and has thus gone quiet in releases. MIE is still active as a singer in live performances though, seeing her Twitter account</li></ul>Sakamoto Maaya [坂本真綾]<br /><ul><li>Anime singer, voice actress</li><li>Her best impression should be her first song I gave too which is from Anime "Cardcaptor Sakura"</li><li>From 2008, with "Cardcaptor Sakura" opening theme song "Purachina"</li><li>So long as it's Anime, I'll give a chance, and we do cross paths, in case you wonder</li><li>I care because it's Anime, mainly. I won't say she's in One Hit Wonder territory, but technically speaking when I give only when I watch the related Anime, then yes maybe it is</li><li>She is active in Anime music industry with some attention from me once in a while however the only other time I gave a song is for Anime "Koufuku Graffiti" in 2015, but I assure you, she is active and in 2018 is going to release a new single for Anime "Fate/Grand Order"</li></ul>pe’zmoku<br /><ul><li>Combination of jazz band "PE'Z"&nbsp;and acoustical singer-songwriter "suzumoku"</li><li>Their best impression has got to be their first song I gave which is from Anime "BLEACH"</li><li>From 2008, with "BLEACH" ending theme song "Gallop"</li><li>I didn't really lose them as fast as they ended their collaboration per se, so I'll say no because I've been actively watching them for new songs over the years they are active</li><li>I care because it's a unique amalgamation (#vocabulary) between jazz and acoustics, and I think that's really cool. I wouldn't say their melodies are fantastic but the unique style kind of compensates it to some extent. It didn't last long though</li><li>They have been active from 2007 to 2009 and has since stopped after a full album release in 2009. Nothing else much to talk about there. You can explore the individual groups separately if you want to. For my discussion I will mention about PE'Z in Part 2 probably</li></ul>RSP&nbsp; (also Real Street Project)<br /><ul><li>Pop music group which originally consisted of a singer duo and a backup dance group</li><li>Their impressions lie not on Anime tie-ins but actually romance songs outside of Anime, and to be biased to one of them is not giving the producers behind them enough credit</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Kansha."</li><li>I've listened to them when they were active</li><li>I care because the combination of vocals are unique, and that extended further with great melodies since then and has kept the momentum for their style for some time</li><li>RSP has split into the vocals who have kept the original name and "d-RSP" the dance group in 2009, and has been active for two years before their 2nd album in 2011</li></ul>RYTHEM<br /><ul><li>Pop singer-songwriter duo consisting of YUKA (also yucat) and YUI (also Neat's, Niitsu Yui)</li><li>Their best impression might just be one of the topic songs from their final called "Mudai", It expresses their emotions for disbandment (will elaborate later on this) and affection towards family and friends well</li><li>From 2008, with song "Love Call" in collaboration with Kimaguren</li><li>They stopped before I could hear more</li><li>I care because they symbolize a different take on J-Pop music unlike the generic ones from Ikimonogakari to YUI, and also has unique harmony when singing together</li><li>After their best album in 2009, RYTHEM has in 2010 released a final album and single and disbanded into their solo career counterparts. YUKA has since transitioned to "yucat" focusing on Dark Gothic image with electronic punk rock and emo pop tunes as base and has since released 5 mini-albums under this name. YUI went on to sing similar pop styles as the group under "Neat's", releasing three albums till date and will move on to use her real name in 2018 as final transition to solo career development</li></ul>Sambomaster [サンボマスター]<br /><ul><li>Rock n' Roll three-piece band, sometimes generic pop and rock</li><li>Their best impression might be their early songs, including hits such as "Sekai wa Sore wo Ai to Yobundaze" and Anime theme songs and later hits in 2009 such as "Sekai wo Kaesasete Okureyo"</li><li>From 2008, with Movie "BLEACH" theme song "Hikari no Rock"</li><li>Can't stop rock n' roll, bro</li><li>I care because they have the most generic rock style I've ever hear in the J-Rock industry, and their own rock n' roll style is just impeccable and super memorable</li><li>As of 2017 they have released a single and album to much social media attention (as with over the years too ever since changing labels) and has performed consistently in live and rock festivals throughout the country</li></ul>THYME<br /><ul><li>Three-piece pop-rock band singing more often for Anime songs</li><li>Their only impression was from the Anime tie-in which I didn't watch but thought the song was great, so what a coincidence</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "&nbsp;Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora" opening theme song "Fly Away"</li><li>They've stopped as a band. Period.</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>After their final album as a group in 2008, they have announced disbandment in 2010 and the vocalist who originally used this name as her solo back in 2002 (omg) reused it to purpose and further her solo career, and has been fairly active ever since. I don't notice any new songs though. She can be found on Twitter (@thyme_singer)</li></ul>VELTPUNCH<br /><ul><li>Rock band (of varying band size) which focus on punk rock and emo rock</li><li>Their best impression was from the first song given which is also their only Anime tie-in</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "Nabari no Ou" opening theme song "CRAWL"</li><li>Can't stop, won't stop</li><li>I care because I've believed them in soul that they deliver great music that sounds in my heart. Their emotion and strength makes them one of the more unique alternative rock bands in the J-Rock industry despite their lack of popularity</li><li>As of 2016 they have came back from their hiatus back in 2012 with a best album and since 2015 released two singles and an album within two years with a new band structure (which technically isn't the first since they did this twice before in 2008 and in 2011 - refer to <a href="http://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-artist-changes-and-how-much-it.html" >"The Artist Changes And How Much It Matters"</a>)</li></ul>SID [シド]<br /><ul><li>Four-piece rock band focusing on mostly generic rock and sometimes punk rock after slight transition to a major label since 2008 (before was focus on pop rock)</li><li>Their best impression was mostly from the emotional songs they sang from 2009-2010</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "Kuroshitsuji" opening theme song "Monochrome no Kiss"</li><li>Can't stop, won't stop</li><li>I care because I feel their melodies resonate within me, especially emotional ones, but recently they have proven otherwise. Besides that I have no comment on why I still care till this point, maybe because I miss the old style which they still present from time to time</li><li>As of 2017 they releases two singles (one for Anime Movie "Kuroshitsuji ~Book of Atlantic~") and an album, so I would say that is fairly active considering they have been quieter than most active bands since around 2014</li></ul>STEREOPONY [ステレオポニー]<br /><ul><li>Three-piece rock band focusing on generic rock, maybe punk rock</li><li>Their best impression was likely from their emotional tunes, most notably from 2010 single "OVER DRIVE"</li><li>From 2008, with Anime "BLEACH" ending theme song "Hitohira no Hanabira"</li><li>They have disbanded, so what can I say?</li><li>I care because I think they are prospective as a popular rock band, but that kind of took a wrong turn and ended up in disappointment, to my surprise. Their melodies are still better than the average and I wished I could hear more even with slight transition to more punk music before they disbanded</li><li>STEREOPONY has since left the music industry after their disbandment in 2012 with a single and a best album. Vocalist AIMI's throat couldn't take it; it was sad. Read it on Wikipedia yourself</li></ul>Tainaka Sachi [タイナカ彩智]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter, music producer</li><li>Her best impression was from the first song I ever gave to be honest, from 2008</li><li>From 2008, with song "Mou Kiss Sarechatta"</li><li>She didn't stop, but what's stopping me? (More below)</li><li>I care because now she presents her solo career in a different light, and I'm getting used to it. I'm also giving chances to her compositions hoping to give her more songs but to no avail</li><li>She has been fairly active since her departure from major label in 2012 and has released albums pretty much every year since. I've listened to her album in 2014 and her 10th anniversary album in 2016</li></ul>Porno Graffitti [ポルノグラフィティ]<br /><ul><li>Pop duo, songwriters themselves, sometimes back-end production</li><li>Their first impression for me was also the first song I gave, and also the early days Klassic Note between 2008-2009</li><li>From 2008, with song "Gift"</li><li>Not stopping as far as me and my enthusiasm knows</li><li>I care because they have been long-time good, to say the least. Not outstanding, but still good. As of now it feels like they have been below average to more which just means I won't get to hear them often but still</li><li>In 2017 they releases a couple of singles before releasing an album, so I'll say that's fairly active. I've not been kind to their songs though since 2014 and only back in 2016, and even then I've not heard their new album yet. Sad.</li></ul>SPECIAL OTHERS<br /><ul><li>Four-piece instrumental band, focusing on pop rock and post rock</li><li>Their best impression should be on their 2009 album release "PB", with their topic song of the same name being the best</li><li>From 2008, thanks to "NANO-MUGEN COMPILATION" with music piece "Laurentech"</li><li>Can't stop, won't stop</li><li>I care because they are the first and only surviving music-based artist I know of today, and are still the best in Klassic Note</li><li>Recent years they have reached 10th year anniversary, so collaborations with other artists to write songs instead is their way of celebration. As of 2016 they released a full album, and in 2017 they released their 2nd collaboration mini-album</li></ul><br />=======LIGHTNING ROUND!!=======<br />Aya Kamiki [上木彩矢]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter for J-Pop music, sometimes rock and even R&amp;B</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She is doing well after the first time I heard of her in 2008, and is still consistently releasing new songs, so be sure to check her out if you like her style. Personally I think it's okay but as I say again, it's about melody, and there's good reason why it's a one hit wonder</li></ul>Gojo Mayumi [五條真由美]<br /><ul><li>Singer, typically Anime songs, but also sings regular pop songs too</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>She is still fairly active in the music industry today, mainly singing for Anime and doing English cover songs apparently. She does release own songs outside of Anime though from 2005-2013, but not that I cared that much to be honest</li></ul>Kitahara Aiko [北原愛子]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter mainly for pop and Anime songs</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>In 2011 she announced her retirement (yeah, not disband, not hiatus) from the music industry so that's a rare one. Then again ever since I gave her this song in 2008 she hasn't been really active already, even though if that's the case I wouldn't have bothered</li></ul>Uura Saeka [宇浦冴香]<br /><ul><li>Singer-songwriter for Anime songs, typically runs freelance</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>Hmm this one has some history. She now uses her real name Uura Saeko or URAN to do freelance composition and music ie. not tied to particular agency, for her songs. After giving that one Ayakashi song (lol) in 2008 she went on to release new albums, eventually jumping to another name "Cherie" in 2011 and back to the name above in 2012, and later coming back in 2016 with this new name, after settling her marriage due to the hiatus</li></ul>Kojima Megumi [小島めぐみ]<br /><ul><li>Anime voice actress, idol singer I presume (see below)</li><li>[One Hit Wonder]</li><li>This one has little history, so I'll presume a lot here. She was fairly active in voice acting only until 2007, once for Anime "SKET DANCE" in 2012, and that's it. I believe she stopped the work already since she is not that popular and her Anime roles aren't aplenty, and that there isn't much social media presence of her today. So I'll take it that she retired due to lack of popularity. Not the first one I know, but yeah, rare case</li></ul>=====END OF LIGHTNING ROUND=====<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />TIL I know how to name genres lol. Okay, enough of those, I'm done for this week. Stay tuned for next week to see if I will continue this for another three weeks. Yes, this is divided into four parts so I don't collapse on the work load. Cya guys next week, and we'll see how much I can carry on for this lol. Stay tuned tonight for Entertainment News. I hope to not do this so that it'll be a post a day over the weekend, but we'll see. It's heck a lot just to type all this out. Research is just a small part of this report. Just like real reports. The testing and research are just a fraction of that 300-word report. *laughs slowly* Haha bye<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
