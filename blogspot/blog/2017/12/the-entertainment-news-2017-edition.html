<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #53</h2>
I almost forgot today's a Sunday and I have to do this LAST POST OF THE YEAR!!! Yeah! Cya guys next year haha (oh that's for the ending?)<br /><br />Also, KLASSIC NOTE SONG AWARDS 2017 RESULTS ARE OUT!!! YEAH!! Be sure to check it out! Or just listen to the preview. Whatever. It's the last day of 2017 anyway. You do what you like. *laughs*<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">ANIME</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Just Because!</span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"What do you think college life is?" Picking up chicks! Haha yeah right Eita will NEVER do that</div></blockquote>Okay in case you haven't watched the heck out of the last episode (12) yet, and I'm going to spoil the heck out of this after this long sentence, they have graduated. And according to my predictions last week, despite the many unpredictable circumstances, I'll say I'm close to the 2nd ending I proposed - where Eita is a NO and everyone else is a YES. But in this case, Eita refuses to meet up with Natsume, and as predicted, Natsume can't bring up enough courage to do it all the way, so she kind of gave up. No really, I consider that as it. Then again, we should know why I left Komiya as sort of a "don't care" case because she'll be the victim (even if the photo won wasn't from her work), meaning Eita will never say yes to the poor girl. Hey, leaving her to cry is fine, beating a home run as far as the meteors can go is a little over, but putting a future story is not. Well, at least, it's an adequate ending to have. I mean, what else can be done? I wished for a more striking ending though, because if it's done during graduation the future insight will be way more interesting, but sure, this is good enough. All in all I think this show deserves praise in story and character development, but seriously lacks in quality animation (I mean, I watch this final episode and half the time I want to kill myself) and detail which I thought I can see more of. Well, not to be hopeful and on a more positive note, I think this show is well done. Good enough to make me anticipate every episode (besides the beginning because starting with a home run is weird tbh), and enough for me to make predictions. Hey, I missed a romance show like that, and I think this show delivered. Good job people; this original Anime is indeed something worth watching. Although to be honest if I wrote the ending I'll choose the same for Eita (make him fail his entrance and fall back on his initial acceptance) and make sure the confession is done on the day of graduation. With total impact. So that Natsume will NEVER be able to party with her friends. *laughs*<br />P.S. I wished my ending was like that with that one girl, but not like it happens lol it broke halfway through in secondary (middle) school already haha *cries like Komiya*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mIoC3ddtS3k/WkYp7pT_uxI/AAAAAAAAkDI/2ra02A929Zca0f1Z9eD6Vl-url_SBlycgCLcBGAs/s320/justbecause12_ending.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This series in a nutshell.<br />And man the animation is terrible lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://randomc.net/2017/12/27/winter-2018-preview/"><span style="font-size: large;">Winter 2017 Preview</span></a></blockquote>According to Random Curiosity, I can only confidently say "Dagashi Kashi 2" for next season unfortunately. However, I will be taking note of the following for reasons so stupid you'll end up not watching it because I am going to haha<br /><br /><ul><li>Toji no Miko: There's Hondo Kaede with a main role (haven't gotten over her lovely voice yet), and I'll see if I like the action considering they have done pretty much every corner of advertisement to promote this original Anime</li><li>Pop Team Epic: I'll see if I can even survive an episode. And Dagashi Kashi is half that episode length</li><li><strike>Cardcaptor Sakura</strike> No I'm not doing it but I like the theme songs though</li><li>Mitsuboshi Colors: I'll see if these kids can even make me stay for an episode</li><li><strike>Kokkoku</strike> Nope not doing it I don't like time manipulation at all</li><li>Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san: If I can stand that b*tch for an episode I'll watch it haha</li><li>Koi wa Ameagari no You ni: I can be interested in this if I want to</li></ul><br />That's pretty much it. Hmm, looks like I have quite a line-up (Audience: You haven't checked how many shows you liked?) if I were to watch all of them, but don't you worry I probably won't.<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MANGA</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Kuroshitsuji</span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Wait, Ciel was only worth FOURTY POUNDS?? Well then again it was the 19th century so I guess it's worth more. (Edit: <a href="http://www.in2013dollars.com/1885-GBP-in-2017?amount=40">in2013dollars.com</a>&nbsp;says about 4.8k pounds today)</div></blockquote>The new chapter (135) gives us further insight into Ciels' past. Remember the slave trade? Yep, now we'll get the full story. Ciel Ciel noticed he was being sold (illegally, of course) along with his brother who also somehow survived the incident, but managed to take the father's ring in order to show their status if they ever get out of this. That is, if they ever. They are immediately sold to a buyer who gives them food, gives them clothes, and gives them a reason to die. Yeah, they need pure souls for the summoning ritual, they say. Turns out the other Ciel was the only pure one lol. I wouldn't hold my breath as to what happens next, I'm guessing that Ciel Ciel did not do anything to kill his brother but considering he has the ring which was not in his parson, he might have indirectly used his brother for something probably related to the devil. Remember the butler Sebastian? We're getting there. Oh damn, this story, so many feels. And I like. *evil laughs*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="455" data-original-width="382" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdoFMSzpxY8/WkjTMyADg6I/AAAAAAAAkEc/LhvAR1xLwt8DliqpdMi89iv_5fKU58X4gCLcBGAs/s200/135_016.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="167" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">To all kids: Do not try this at home.<br />(Some kid here is real smart though.)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi</span></blockquote>The new chapters (96-97) talk about entirely different things haha. Firstly, not a dagashi. Since I believe in Kokonotsu then I assume Hotaru-san is wrong in the way that people don't just sell chicken wings in dagashi stores anymore? And there's chocolate. I think I've seen those stuff before, just not in typical dagashi fashion of course. Wheat chocolate is pretty common as a snack in Southeast Asia too, and those also won't melt under the summer heat. And FYI I live near the equator so I know.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="355" data-original-width="351" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qZIhr219Mtk/WkjVblgSY8I/AAAAAAAAkEo/S8KZKLRk15M64D-j07QOSYl2gNoj4eDAgCLcBGAs/s200/img00006Owk.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="197" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sayashi is <i>so</i> smart she makes Hotaru look dumb haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I'll still be reading this manga despite the fact that the new season of Anime is coming next year because I know I'm still behind the content they are going to cover. I mean, who is Hajime?<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">A Channel</span></blockquote>The new chapter (103) talks about Keiko, Yuuko's sister if you still remember who she is. (FYI voiced by Iguchi Yuka in A Channel +smile OVA) She meets Tooru on the streets and Tooru, professionally and in a matured fashion, treated her to a drink in the nearby cafe and helps Keiko kill time before she meets her sister. In all A Channel fashion too it's nothing but jokes, super misunderstandings of how cute/cool Tooru is between the sisters, and I'm glad Run isn't involved in any of this haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="338" data-original-width="460" height="235" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HUq76Za74U8/WkjXIkzebkI/AAAAAAAAkE0/T4V_XGsmiBo5VliSonndFG5NcsWBhf8tQCLcBGAs/s320/img00003xgG.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Keiko is thinking too much here tbh<br />(On the other hand can you get hit on by me? Hehe)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>映画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">MOVIE</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large;">Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man Tell No Tales</span>&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">"Skeleton walks into a bar, orders a beer and a mop." I mean, how have I never heard this joke, Uncle Jack? *laughs*</blockquote><div style="text-align: left;">We're back with the good old Pirates series, and boy do we have a lot to talk about. I seriously thought this was the last of the series though, but no this was not really. But hey, let's talk about the fifth film of the franchise I too am not familiar with, shall we? Legend says about Jack Sparrow's history, where he was still a young pirate and sailed <strike>with his father (I assume)</strike> in the seven seas on the Black Pearl. The thing is, led by Spanish Royal Navy, Salazar has decided to bring an end to piracy (not like, illegal downloads today though lol) by hunting down all pirate ships to end the troubles of sea. Sadly, being duped by the quickly succeeded Captain Sparrow, he was tricked into the Devil's Triangle, which led to a curse of the Spaniard and his crew to be forever undead, stuck in the Triangle forever. Jack Sparrow, after close to half a decade of losing to Blackbeard and finally getting back his ship (see previous movie, and that Spaniard are different from this one if I'm not wrong) while still unable to crack the lid (of the bottle) is left stuck with a small improperly made ship with his crew which is about to leave his ass behind lol. (Hey, pirate talk, so no censorship) Bring in Carina Symth, horologist (yes the front part sounds like whore, pirate talk) and astronomer, who has understood what his father left her with the book and decided to search for the truth while mistakenly being hunted as a witch. (Hey, science is no myth, ladies and gentlemen. My future salary depends on it lol) Combined with Will Turner's son Henry Turner who seeks a solution to save his father from the ship curse (recall Flying Dutchman), the two decide to aim for the Triden of Poseidon to resolve the above crisis. What crisis? Jack did it, as always. He traded his compass for a drink and thus betrayed the item, and unknown to him, was apparently the key to releasing the undead crew. And thus they are released from the Triangle, leading their ship (I wouldn't call that a ship) to eradicate ships one after another. Bringing to the attention of now pirate rich Barbossa (that one with the fake leg and the ten ships) (okay I promise to keep this short I'm just practising my writing skills lol) who has been removed of his ships, he ended up having to make a deal to hunt down the Sparrow under the threat of Salazar. I'll not dictate what happened in the process, but the end is most important. Because of Barbossa's knowledge of the stars (his star as a pirate to follow home, and the name to his child) and the seas (being former possessor of Gallilei Gallileo's diary which includes the ruby), he double-crosses the undead in typical pirate fashion, discovers that he was leading himself to the Trident of Poseidon with the girl who managed to figure out everything herself, which is now no surprise considering it's his daughter. The clue on the book assumes that the Trident exists with "every curse of the sea" (I'll assume all that Poseidon had on curse), and of course, destroying it will alleviate all of them. And so they did, but led to the loss (I wouldn't say death here because it's not the final movie yet lol) of Barbossa in order to save the others and also facilitated the union of Henry with his father and of course Carina, to whom you could just call her Barbossa now. What happens next? A hint at the end of the movie (you missed it? how could you) signals the return of a familiar claw (SPOILERS) owned by none other than the evil <span style="font-size: xx-small;">Davy Jones</span>, which I assume will lead to the end of the franchise. Well, technically he's not cursed (by the Trident), but then, what is he? What will he do to harm the fellows of the sea? Maybe we will find out then.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="534" data-original-width="1280" height="133" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LWVVQi1gmUM/WkZOCtwbZSI/AAAAAAAAkDY/nnJOPxpgD48-1l5zvTLXZJNt-BVskTDVACLcBGAs/s320/pirates5_barbossa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This movie in a nutshell haha also the only thumbnail I was interested and spoiler free.<br />(Carina undressing was a close second, but hey, I wanted to make a GIF haha)</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;">Final conclusion to this series before I end this off for another day aye (lol), but suffice it to say people need to be more open to the series development, and not dwell on too much on the love tale that is Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Come on, I know that shit. Even my sis loves that. And then the <strike>third or</strike> fourth movie came out and everyone started to hate the series for continuing on the pirate tales. Hey guess what? They delivered. They gave you back the good old couple. Add in the son with a wife he carried back on her port (lol), and you've got a happy ending for now and a prospective happy ending in the future. Hey, I'll be looking forward to a nicer future with these people of the seas, and perhaps, it'll lead to the conclusion we'll end to love. (Nah, it's not possible with people today even Star Wars is disappointing apparently) Still, I liked this series, which is why I chased this show from the 3rd movie (and thus wasn't heavily affected by the love part) and have not been disappointed. Kudos to whoever did the special effects for the undead and especially the sharks because that was too real tbh what happens if you got bit on the part where its jaw didn't exist? Haha just joking, but I love the direction of where this series is going, and I'm optimistic for a good ending despite feeling like a revival of a money-making opportunity. (Happy, idiots?) Take your time Disney; make this series end good.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm not going to waste more time to talk about Klassic Note other than that final review of the year of Ten-chan's new single, so be sure to check that out if you liked her. Cya guys next year then, and until then... I wish I wouldn't cough till the following year. Turns out I may have to. Well, to each his set of problems. Mine just happens to be of my own cause I guess. Bye!<br /><br />P.S. The new format does look a lot better so I might just use this starting from next week. What do you think? *silence* Oh I'm talking to myself? Oh well whatever haha</div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
