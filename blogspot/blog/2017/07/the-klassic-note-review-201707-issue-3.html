<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note Review 2017.07 Issue 3</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
Welcome back to the TrySail-Klassic Note Review Special part 3 <a href="../../2016/06/the-klassic-note-review-201606-issue-1.html" ><span title="*wink*">😉</span></a> and yes, it's apparently a trend for me to catch up on their singles after I've rejected them. Hehe well since that's what I'm here for, let's talk about what makes me want to come back to listen to them again, despite how much of them isn't what I expected of this idol group. Haha, I said it.<br /><br />But seriously, if not for the live performance video I probably won't land my hands on the 2nd album and give the remaining songs in this review when it releases next month. I mean it. The topic song is disappointing, for starters. Okay, let's get to it.<br /><br /><br /><br />[For ease of understanding which I will not mention in the review(s), using the first image you see, from top left and clockwise, that's Asakura Momo, Amamiya Sora and Natsukawa Shiina]<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />HoneyWorks meets TrySail - Senpai. [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/26/SVWC-70211.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/28/SVWC-70213.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/30/SVWC-70215.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Ignoring Anime as usual, "close-ups are better" I always say. The idea of a room isn't bad either)<br /><br />Origin: It was the end of the year 2016. The cinemas air HoneyWorks' latest attempt in creating the ideal romance Anime, with cover and original songs written and all faucets of production done by the creators' unit as they are referred to, from illustration to music. This is their second attempt already (first was with idol group sphere), and ignoring their main line singer CHiCO it's yet another collaboration, but with idol group TrySail. Ignoring the obvious company-based partnership, this turned out to be better than anticipated, and even better than expected. Given the expertise that HoneyWorks has over the years in writing Anison coupled with the recently popular and young idol group, it's no wonder such a miracle can exist. Other than that, I'm just here to review the single. And after half a year from release, it's no wonder it's still worth of mention. And without further ado, let's talk about how such a grand combination can come into fruition, and how it ended up being great.<br /><br />(1) Senpai. [Senior]<br />For being an Anime movie opening theme song, this is rather impressive from first listen, seven months ago. But really, HoneyWorks has been known to create impact in their tunes, and this one is no exception. The catch from the introduction drew me in, and everything else just comes in nicely. This is one melody you'll not hear twice, not from these guys who made it great. Add on TrySail's youthful singing voices and that music video about them back in school doing confessions and stuff... it's the romance stuff we've all wanted to see, and hear. Overall a nice melody to listen to, and that certain parts of this song will want you coming back for more. The lyrics also ring well to the theme of the movie (which I didn't watch) and the idea of liking someone who is older than you. I mean, we've all been through that, and now this song cements the idea in perfect relation. The chorus tells us all:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"For the person (I) like who was born a little earlier</div><div style="text-align: center;">(I've) been in love with (him) a little while</div><div style="text-align: center;">If only (I) can make the clock go ahead in time</div><div style="text-align: center;">You and (my) seat was getting closer</div><div style="text-align: center;">You were also getting a lover</div><div style="text-align: center;">No it's not like that!</div><div style="text-align: center;">...Now I've fallen in love (with you)</div><div style="text-align: center;">It's got nothing to do with age difference</div><div style="text-align: center;">Senior, notice me"</div></blockquote>It may feel long, this song, but for confessing how much this song is good at I may be stretching it too much. But this is one good song, that's for sure.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Fantastically Above Average)<br /><br />(2) BraveSail<br />Didn't expect HoneyWorks to write a song for TrySail (well, they did for sphere too, but still), and this one fits them quite well, to say the least. Before I didn't have the mood to give this because this was released at the end of the year (you know, Klassic Note stuff), I thought this song was very closely themed to the adventure and sailing theme TrySail was known for, at least in name. After that, and giving it from the live performance video, I noticed it does suit them quite well. Despite it being a long melody too, this common melody does have its plus points. Well, apart from the usual song misses and very wordy lyrics which rather adequately describe the girls on an adventure, this song in itself is one iconic song for the group, at least, in name. Otherwise, you can enjoy this song as much as I said, now that I think this is a great tune to listen.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Nicely Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall I think it's okay for a single, but great because of the topic song. If you've never heard of how TrySail songs sound like, this can be a great place to start. Anime songs, songs about adventure... this is a complete package of understanding. Also, a package of great tunes to remember. Comparing it to their latest single "adrenaline!!!" though I wouldn't say this is great, but this is not your usual TrySail single. It's unusually long, and it's unusually good, so be sure to give this a listen.<br /><br /><br /><br />AND NOT FORGETTING...!!! (Seriously what's with all the full stops on song titles lol)<br /><br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />TrySail - Original. [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/35/SVWC-70228.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/29/SVWC-70230.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/31/SVWC-70232.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(I'm really liking these covers for some reason, even if they feel rather overexposed and aren't close &nbsp;enough they have some character though and I don't mean Anime even though it's also great imo)<br /><br />Origin: Wow this one is going to be a long story, so sit tight. It was about five months ago, where this released, and I immediately threw it in the trash. Yeah, rough start for a single, I would say. Fast forward to two weeks later (it's still February 2017) and I picked up the Anime "Demi-chan wa Kataritai" along with its opening theme song. Yes, it was them. That was how much I didn't give a first impression of this release. Not that it was bad, but after watching the Anime you'll feel the relevance of the pop music style represented in this single, I guess? And then there was the B-side. So second time round and also due to the live performance video it introduced me to this song once again, and that is how this ended on my shelf. What a journey huh, from being rejected to being accepted. It was as if this was meant to be. But it wasn't all because of the songs; it was because of mood. And this one has all of them.<br /><br />(1) Original.<br />Being the topic song, the music style does bring a certain level of impact and pop despite being a theme song for the Anime "Demi-chan wa Kataritai", which, honestly saying was just a drama series, so... this was not necessary? Written and produced by familiar composer mito-sensei (I did talk about this in Aki-chan's best album), the song has its usual weaknesses an Anime theme song, including weak bridges and overall weak melody especially in verses. The lyrics also represent enough of what is of the Anime to be honest, which is quite a disappointment. But hey, an Anime theme song I can take. That's what I think of this song, to say the least.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Below Average)<br /><br />(2) Chip log<br />Of course, the reason why this single came to be is with the B-side. Similar to the previous single, this song also had an adventure theme to it, and more that is written in the lyrics and ship stuff being fictionalised in some form. The music style though did throw me off at first impression just like "BraveSail", so this shouldn't be a surprise why only till now do I give the song. In terms of mood of the song I felt that this is more complete to be called an "adventure", as the lyrics literally describe a journey to find treasure, which was a joy to sing through. Also worth mentioning is the overall melody, which did not suffer major song faults because I liked the bridge part of the song even if it felt long. To compliment, thanks to virtualisation of this song from the video footage from the live performance, I have a better understanding how this song sounds. I'm not denying it; this is a rather good tune to go on a journey with.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: A decent single, if not compared to the rest of the TrySail singles. On itself, it does have some positive points with it, because this is a very TrySail single, in terms of fitting music style and how the lyrics are thought out in general. Other than that, if you liked their music so far, this is another good release. Well, not until you've heard the next one, of course. Do not be thrown off by how it sounds though, it's still pretty well done.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />So, this was bundled in today's package that arrived today with Sumipe's new single, as you can see. That cardboard is what I received on hand, just in case you wondered what's inside.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NV-V-Z199II/WXsrDOKfLqI/AAAAAAAAhCk/gRR-PZlhWfk6Mn4X3po7CT7nTP7XCeoPQCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20170728_150301.jpg" width="320" /></div>Well, let me talk about what I should expect before showing anything first. Buying from Gamers Online Shop once again (remember Aki-chan's single in May?), I will expect special gifts from the latter single "Original." AND (this one is unprecedented) <b>an image calendar as a gift</b> from MusicRay'n (yes the talent and production company who host TrySail, sphere etc.) as a present for spending more than 2000yen in Gamers on their products ("Seiyuu Artist Fair", they call it), which is the reason why I didn't go further to find any other online store which may have the special gift photo for the HoneyWorks single because we know, it has been half a year. But this offer, I cannot miss. So yeah, you bet I got it because they know I was a good boy (lol)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="400" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xthDcFc98tE/WXsrTWbwvzI/AAAAAAAAhCo/yAQVMkS7sIoQweb3q7fDWVEL8u4YEpSUACLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20170728_150656.jpg" width="300" /></div>As you can see (I don't think you can see the text behind haha), two singles, one photo, and a calendar at the back. So yeah, with all calendars must have an image on it, so... here's "SORA AMAMIYA". <span style="font-size: large;">YES!</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iry4hfoB6HI/WXss15yXvRI/AAAAAAAAhC0/s6rtxFBlt0Q2Cnx_dA09s0qKJkwzs2x_wCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_20170728_152551.jpg" width="400" /></div>So relevant considering her new single just released this week! (not reviewing, but be sure to support her, yes?) (not in red, just because) (not in blue either, now that's weird haha) Okay let's take some time to take in the fact that it's also quality-printed that I want to bring it to school next month?? Yeah, it's for August too. Damn, now I have to put it in a clear file and take it out whenever I don't know of the date even though I school in a Surface Pro tablet which is a paperless medium and is also a computer that has a calendar lol<br /><br />...<br /><br />I wonder who's on July though hehe I have no idea tbh ARGH I WANT THEM ALL!!! WHY CAN'T THEY SHOW ME ALL OF THEM!!! haha<br /><br />Okay, let's talk about the singles. In TrySail single stereotypical fashion, if you have not known of it <b>the booklet</b> inside reveals a full image of the trio. So yes, here's for the HoneyWorks single... (which is technically not theirs) (sorry for screwing up the label right above the booklet; you'll get what I mean when you see the next one?)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mLfIpOIIhCQ/WXsvfGVKCRI/AAAAAAAAhDE/k4MRoUFQHzoBiZ7_Wxkg7q_WiCaQv2O0QCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20170728_153208.jpg" width="320" /></div>... And this is for their 5th single.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFjNZKiXTjg/WXsvifvZBVI/AAAAAAAAhDI/3xl3JU2aCiAT3_KogK6qOOWbPgo6WVJFgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170728_154743.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFjNZKiXTjg/WXsvifvZBVI/AAAAAAAAhDI/3xl3JU2aCiAT3_KogK6qOOWbPgo6WVJFgCLcBGAs/s320/IMG_20170728_154743.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>As usual, I like them close-ups. And did I mention about overexposure on the latter single? Yeah, that's turning me off already. Also, not close at all. Very disappointed at this point already. Oh yah, I'm here for the music, sorry xD<br /><br />We're not done yet though. I deviated so much I almost forgot. I would like you guys to recall a certain something from when I bought Aki-chan's latest single two months ago from Gamers too, and yeah, <b>remember the free magazine?</b> IT'S BACK!<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="ja">【<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E6%AF%8E%E6%9C%8820%E6%97%A5%E3%81%AF%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B2%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5?src=hash" target="_blank">#毎月20日はフロゲの日</a>】7/20配布開始「フロゲー」Vol.239は【 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E5%A4%8F%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A4%E3%82%8A?src=hash" target="_blank">#ゲーマーズ夏のアニメまつり</a> 2017 × <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA?src=hash" target="_blank">#ゲーマーズ</a>】描き下ろしイラストが表紙ゲマ！「ゲーマーズ！」アニメ情報やここだけのスクープ情報もあるらしいゲマ！？<a href="https://t.co/QfFWuJudeO">https://t.co/QfFWuJudeO</a> <a href="https://t.co/k0wa1oJVtQ">pic.twitter.com/k0wa1oJVtQ</a></div>— ゲマ【株式会社ゲーマーズ】 (@gamers_no_gema) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamers_no_gema/status/887869801695256578" target="_blank">July 20, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Showing official Twitter post because I'm not scanning this, but then again there isn't much for me to look at anyway. Okay, <b>the cover was Anime "Gamers"</b> and not to be confused with the shop, quite literally became their promotion shtick and also for their summer fair event which now requires minimum 5000yen spending (which is higher than the 3k from two months ago) and gives away Anime-related goods, from photos to posters and stuff. Maximum 50k for Anime "Eromanga-sensei" blanket lol so many offers (this is the only thing worth mentioning anyway, sorry I don't know the girl on the Seiyuu Paradise preview)<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow this is a long one. Imagine if I didn't cut this one from Sumipe's single review. You'll probably just scroll down until you see "THE PACKAGE", right? Haha I knew it. Anyways, I'm done for today, and this week. Cya guys for Entertainment News come Sunday night, yes? Until then... I need to rest my fingers. Oh, I haven't watched "Gamers" yet? Ugh, I've got enough of that word today already haha<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
