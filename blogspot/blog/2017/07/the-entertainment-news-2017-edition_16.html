<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #29</h2>
Wow, what a week in entertainment. I mean, MY week. I hear next week is better? Ah, I can't wait. Let's hope that project professor don't suddenly want to call me to discuss about my work in the next school year hehe<br /><br /><br />ANIME ("Because drama is more interesting than fantasy and sci-fi sh*t" lol)<br /><b>Koi to Uso: </b>"*looks at prospective wife* OMG the government has answered to my personal desires!" -Nejima Yukari, 2017 (Haha I wished he'd say that)<br />The new episode (2) talks about Sanada-san (I'll not use her nickname lol tapeworm), Nejima's newly announced and proposed wife from the government, which just turns out to be someone he'd dreaming of knowing, let alone have to marry. She's polite, straightforward, alone (ie. no friends?), maybe clumsy (I mean, she shows EVERYTHING lol), some tsundere here and there... what more can you ask? (This is the time I would offer incense to my 'ancestors' but I guess I shouldn't lol) On the other hand, Sanada is also trying to figure things out, like besides after worrying about meeting the prospective partner, also got to learn of what makes the main guy attractive with Terasaka, and also making friends somehow. Hey, all in all a nice ending to whatever shock you might have gotten in the first episode, but I think this show has prospective. And... I think I'm getting used to the 'disturbing scenes' somehow. I mean, Terasaka is the one with the big chest and a** haha (So wait, the government doesn't care if your wife can bear you more kids??) [<strike>Asian</strike> Chinese Tradition: Seniors tend to think of wives with larger... bottoms and/or hips tend to bear more and 'bigger' children, resulting them in general being healthier in the future]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1521" data-original-width="1280" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x5_DuPDGGRk/WWg9Aqqn1iI/AAAAAAAAgoc/tnPznF_dYCwIs5eiaFDW187Mf7H3sFsyQCLcBGAs/s320/koitouso02_shock.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="269" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Because this sums up the episode so well so... YEAH BIG IMAGE!!<br />(I swear I stitched this one up myself)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "So what on Earth are we?" Pawns of society, bro! *laughs heartily*<br />P.P.S. (I'll be doing from this week onwards to talk about love bias for the main guy) This episode's "I'm Nejima-kun's Wife" candidate goes to... Terasaki-san!! Well, just for the one part where she is passionately spilling out her love points about &nbsp;him, I guess. I mean, I'll never know someone who is in mutual love with me now, so I appreciate the effort the author put in for this one.<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/07/10/koi-to-uso-02/comment-page-1/#comment-2284035" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>]<br /><br /><b>Aho Girl:</b> How stupid can stupid be, you say? "This episode is sponsored by LOWHON" wtf but seriously can we just do a romance show about Akkun and that disciplinary council president?? hehe<br />In this new episode (2) we are shown of how many people can Akkun deal with his seemingly endless powers when all dealing with that idiot Yoshiko (this one is introductory, I promise). I mean, he has to fight the president (because spelling it all out is a pain, and she doesn't seem to have a name) who pounces on him like a beast (lol), deal with the sister who is also an idiot (see?) but only in grades, and more. That idiot also seems to have gained a member in her "gang", and it's definitely not those kids, even though Akkun did go along with them anyway. Well, better draw the line somehow, and I think I found the line in this episode too. Yeah, the fondling scene. I mean, I normally laugh it off most of the time which explains why I can watch two seasons of Seitokai Yakuindomo, but surprisngly not this one. Man, my tolerance is failing me lol. Anyways, funny to watch every episode of this thus far, and this will go a long way to prove funny shows can just stay funny if you show the main guy's abs haha (I mean, the author's previous work is very similar in these aspects)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3DIxcIZq-ZU/WWgxpHLOb3I/AAAAAAAAgoM/yT_oAsUDwPgMfdiFIgq5afeiqaBXucqNwCLcBGAs/s320/ahogirl02_sister.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Her mucus lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. If you trained abs just to get someone like the president to love you (physically) then I say go with it. No guarantees though, although in Anime that's not the case lol. Also, imagine if Sumipe (Uesaks Sumire) was the main girl in Seitokai (Yakuindomo) I'll be blessed haha<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/07/12/aho-girl-02/comment-page-1/#comment-2284033" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>]<br /><br /><b>Tsurezure Children:</b> Man, if only Astronomy Club was this great of an experience of not just watching stars. F*** you, the university I go to! (oops)<br />The new episode (2) that is really nothing about confessions of love, is actually half the episode length?? Oops. Then again, there's plenty to talk about. Ignoring the crazy brocon sister that is Furuya's sibling (we'll talk A TON OF IT later haha), we move on to three more couples and their potential confessions. Sasahara, having being left alone for the Astronomy Club by her senpai, seeks to find new members in the new school year. Meet boring guy (whose name I cannot remember), who has little to no interest in anything (Oreki? This one your cousin or something?) and definitely cannot understand why the girl would be in the club which is not that serious and most likely is a place for socialisation instead. Perhaps he will give the girl a try, if he's interested in anything. The Gouda couple here then we meet a super shy girl and a super serious guy. Hey, not perfect couple, but at least there is understanding. I mean, if a handsome, serious guy says "do whatever you want with me" with a bow you ask him to go out with you haha hey the girl did it anyway. (Also, I swear she sweats profusely in front of anybody, but then again I may have some sweat fetish so leave me alone lol) Lastly, the Sugawara couple in the rain is somehow affectionate, but if we pair a blockhead girl with a try-hard boy we may be hitting a lot of walls. I take my impromptu analogy of hitting a foam target board from the back as an example of hitting it but without any effect, which is pretty much the going on with this couple. Still, they might come together someday, so let's with the guy some luck, yes?<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YjUOhLdF94U/WWgr16QqchI/AAAAAAAAgoE/B2PDyE20M0AbdL363xgLehz3xeAsP5GYQCLcBGAs/s320/tsurezurechildren02_hotaru1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oh god, this sister. Be glad you ever got one of these, Furuya-kun haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Firstly, the sister. Why her pissed off face looks like those voodoo dolls, especially her mouth? Haha I don't mean anything else though.<br />P.P.S. And I'm NOT doing any more sister face expression images on this post any more. But seriously, Tomatsu Haruka, you have outdone yourself. You were made for this role. The contrast in voice may feel weird, but still. (No wonder I thought why the bro voice sounds surprisingly familiar haha) (God, I can watch just this part for days)<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/07/13/tsurezure-children-02/comment-page-1/#comment-2284028" target="_blank">My brocon comment on RC lol</a>]<br /><br /><b>Gamers!: </b>No seriously wtf is with the narration?? I know this is to hook the audience in, but even a gamer knows not to give out spoilers lol<br />Okay, that aside, let's talk about this new series. The episode (1) (I don't know how to slot this number in to fit with the others, so...) briefly introduces the main guys Amano-kun to Tendou-san, apparently the ideal high school girl but also a member of the Game Club in the school. Of course, if you didn't know, any Game Club is only interested in performances in competitions (which explains the merch they got in the club room <span title="*wink*">😉</span>) and he is obviously not in it. Add in his lack of talent to play games effectively or skillfully, you can see why he doesn't want to join after all. I mean, it sounds like heaven, but once you think about it not even best girl is enough to make this otaku fantasy come true anyways. That aside, we do see chances of revival (if you count there might be only four members only, and it takes five to be legit hehe) from the club side, and next episode might just delve into more of Amano's life, firstly with the MONO-san he has been helping out in the SNS game (SNS = Social Networking Service, ie. social media) that he's been playing. Hey, friends we never see before are still friends, right? (I totally agree haha) That, we'll see for ourselves next week. Meanwhile, NO THEME SONGS??? *disappointed face*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1EglnAAEqjo/WWg62zThFFI/AAAAAAAAgoY/j3HPBAyU5kw-LR1DLgHffm6rup1qXJjygCLcBGAs/s320/gamers01_class.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When no one believes you're talking to the most popular girl in <strike>class</strike> school lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "I'm still kind of interested in you." Haha did you notice the one girl that dropped to her seat? Yeah that's the only girl that liked Amano lol<br />P.P.S. Okay, I'll talk about my perspective now. In gaming, I've dabbled quite a bit, and yeah, like Amano, I'm only doing it for fun. Even today I indulge in entertainment that is online videos fired by people playing video games. Never in my life have I ever thought (ever) to want to compete in gaming, stream about it (which is popular nowadays; I mean Windows 10's Xbox App has built-in recording functionality already), or even talk about it with people who like those games because there aren't. I guess that's a problem with modern society with so many gaming options and everyone in your class possibly playing a different game than you respectively, it's no wonder the author might feel such a case. BTW I totally spotted the cliffhanger of Amano rejecting the entry, because I would too, even if there's someone I liked in the club. I mean, we can be friends, but joining the club? I just want to play games for fun. That, I assure you, and not that I know of any spoilers lol, will be in Amano's favour in the near future ie. he just needs to fill in the blanks/be the slave of the club like logistics or admin or whatever haha<br />(Edit: I, for once, keep thinking Tendou-san's voice is Hocchan (Horie Yui), but no. But I know the girl, so I'm fine. She sounds good too btw she voices <strike>Mikasa in Attack on Titan!</strike>&nbsp;oops screwed it up that was the other Yui lol)<br />[<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/07/14/gamers-01/comment-page-1/#comment-2284313" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>]<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>The new chapter (67) brings in two unlikely characters. The father, and the childhood friend. You know who I am referring to. They talk about a snack whilst accidentally bumping on all the wrong areas concerning lousy jokes and having kids for some reason lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="274" data-original-width="428" height="204" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wPfj8GpozeQ/WWtQUjUQadI/AAAAAAAAgo4/HnlWkSVtD8slVR-CZaRZTD730_6oSntiwCLcBGAs/s320/dgsks67_img000006.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When you try to hint your friend but she doesn't get it lol You-san</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />MOVIE<br /><br />...<br /><br />F***ING FINALLY!! Yeah, the expiry date on my Google Play Movies rental egged me to watch this. Also, I wanted to watch with my sis, but you know. She's a busy woman. I'm not a busy man btw<br /><br /><b>Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them: </b>I'll talk in summary of the experience without doing too many spoilers here (even though it's been half a year so I assume you watched last year's best in box office unlike me), but suffice it to say it was fantastic. I mean that, by the "beasts". Story tells of a (if you didn't watch the trailer you should) (and I'm not using technical terms here) guy with a suitcase of beats walking into America, which magic congress bans the inhabiting of beasts, so... yeah. Fun, right? Kind of. Then again, the main guy Newt himself is some legend in wizarding history. (Pottermore fans look away now because I suck at describing stuff) He can make multiple spells work in a second (not many in Hogwarts can do this, including Harry himself), he owns a suitcase with an... Extension Charm which houses ALL of the animals he owns, in way of protecting them and keeping even the endangered alive. Of course this has its effect on society as he accidentally lets it loose on the 1920 New York streets, causing less havoc than what else is also happening at the same time. Well, not like I'll tell you more, but there's fantastic beasts (literally), magic fights (really, Voldermort vs Harry Potter/Dumbledore is crap haha) and so, SO many good magic appearing in the society of New York City I'm jumping for joy already.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"This is all I wanted. Thanks for getting out of school and into society, J.K.Rowling."</i></blockquote>(Not posting images because I respect the rental, especially when everything is so good too)<br /><br />Also, as such, as I see the opportunity to be able to watch movies for free legitimately in the future, <b>I will be able to watching a free movie every month</b> (for now) (every 4 issues if you don't want to count) if I can do so. I'll see about it. Please, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Opinion Rewards</a>, continue to give me surveys and free Play Store credit, thanks! Well, then again if I see anything better than this then we'll see?<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week was as disappointing as the last, but better. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music127/v4/36/8f/ef/368fef84-d5e5-2c04-8563-98c714922dc5/source/268x0w.jpg" />KANA-BOON's new single</abbr></b> was just like any other of their singles but I ended up giving one song only. It sounds too similar in melody already. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/b3/f6/10/b3f6106a-cf92-53ae-8d8a-325b4edfeb93/source/268x0w.jpg" />fumika's new single</abbr></b> was somewhat exciting to hear and it's real good, so be sure to listen to her latest double A-side. The two Anime "Aho Girl" theme song releases have not surfaced yet even though the opening (angela) should be last week and the ending (Uesaka "Sumipe" Sumire) should be this week. I'm okay. I'll wait. I'm getting impatient though. *sigh*<br /><br />Talking about getting impatient, next week brings us (finally) T<b>oyosaki Aki's best album</b>. Yay! You bet I'll be talking about that soon in a review (regardless of the new song review outcome lol), which will get a kickstart with Aki-chan's latest live video performance which no doubt I'll be watching next week too. Oh yeah, also in next week was <b>G-FREAK FACTORY's new single</b>. This one, I waited for a while (three months to be exact) already so I'm pumped to have my hands on the music. Other than that... I mean, Aki-chan is enough, yes?<br /><br />On a side note, I also watched <b>TrySail's live performance</b> on their first album which released last month. "Odeko Da-Shiina", we call her. *applauds* That's Nan-chan if you don't recognise her lol<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">There's a reason why TrySail is No.1 last year.

I hear they did reveal their faces in that one, and I have NOT YET seen it!! Argh pisses me off!!<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I need to try doing two posts every Sunday. But I'll not. For now. Or never. I've been dreaming and thinking about APoL Chapter 17 in recent nights now, so I think I might be able to get back to it. Well, not until the fun-packed week ie. next week is over first, I guess. I mean, there's the game, Aki-chan, Aki-chan, Aki-chan... yeah you know hehe until next time then!<br /><br />[P.S. <abbr class="imgpop"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="" title="Akichan is so~~~~~~~ irresistible!!" /></span>愛生ちゃんた～ま～ら～～～～～～～～～～ん!!</abbr>]<br /><br /><br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
