<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2017.03 Issue 3</h2>
What did I tell you guys. Huh? Another review? Did I hear that? You ask for it, you get it, I must say haha (RIP my wallet) but hey, it's been a long wait. Well, mostly because I've heard the songs two weeks before this and this should've been earlier, but still. It's here, so let's talk about it.<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />96neko - Uso no Hibana [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/34/SRCL-9348.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/28/SRCL-9350.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/29/SRCL-9351.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 974px;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Anime Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(I like how minimal the cover art is in general. As usual, ignore the Anime cover, please.)<br /><br />Origin: Yes, let's talk about her. Surprisingly, she has some background. An easy web search will tell you she's been a singer for quite some time, and despite her boyish appearance turns out to be popular due to her very powerful feminine voice, which is of course, the focus of this release. Other than that, you get her first major single since last year if I'm not wrong (Sony Music probably also chose her for her voice too), and I must say it's pretty impressive. Coupled with an Anime which is more compelling than this release, you get yourselves a great single to listen to. No really, you try watching her earlier songs and covers; you'd hardly hear anything like this.<br /><br />(1) Uso no Hibana [Spark of (a) Lie]<br />Already reading this title wrong countless before its release (thanks Hanabi-chan), this is of course the Anime "Kuzu no Honkai" opening theme song. Saying why the theme songs of the show are better than the show itself must be an understatement, because the releases are on my shelf. Nonetheless, the opening showed a certain level of power covering what's behind the lyrics. The song about emotion and sorrow, all mixed together in a fast-paced melody (I know that composer; remember TrySail?) which makes this song your above average Anime theme song. Seriously, this song packs a punch above that very feminine, soft and alluring voice that is Kuroneko-san (I shall refer her as this now, and that's how the artist name is read) and I'm impressed. Besides suffering from the usual Anime kinks here and there, I must say this is one good tune.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(2) Hitorigoto [Talking to Oneself]<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Do not let go of my gripped hand, I'm here</div><div style="text-align: center;">Don't forget our promise"</div></blockquote>Just in the lyrics expresses quite a lot about what this song has to deliver. A rather mellow mood to tone things down, and here's where Kuroneko-san's voice starts to show. The mood of the song in general does transit quickly between the verses and chorus but hey, it stays freshly different. The vocals here then give credit to this song being that good, and is also a hand on hearing the other side of her singing, instead of the hyped beat we got earlier. The once-in-a-while soft voice and the general melody of this song is making this a good song to remember. Oh, and don't forget her singing at the part before the solo guitar right after the second chorus. So, so good.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(3) Buriki no Dance [Tin Plate Dance]<br />This one, I did some research. Turns out this is a song <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm20296308" target="_blank">originally done by Hatsune Miku</a> (if you don't know her I don't too haha) and the music video is actually online. Top this one up with <a href="https://youtu.be/dyGaqRK43zw" target="_blank">Kuroneko-san's version also online</a> by the time you're reading this, and you get a very different rendition of the song. I must say the latter stands out more because of, in this case, her more manly voice that gives this song the power and style it needs. That, computerised voice cannot do lol. Other than that, it's quite a mouthful to sing this (don't even look at the lyrics, please), but it's real catchy, and if not for Kuroneko-san wanting to get (as in "buy" because it's copyrighted) this song for her new release I would not have known of such a great cover song done by her. Suck it, Hatsune Miku.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: As you can see, not your usual release. Ever since its digital release a week before the physical release (in CD) I've been impressed the first time I heard the whole release, and this eventually became a reality, with me getting hooked to every song in the list. Even if you're not a fan of the Anime or Hatsune Miku (lol) you should give this lady a listen. Her voice will impress you, and coupled with a ton of good songs you've got yourself a well-deserved release.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />Okay, let's talk about this quickly. Because... there isn't much to talk about. I mean, there's the clear folder of Hanabi-chan getting grabbed if that's what you want.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W2iqj_OasgM/WNEmMrzlvCI/AAAAAAAAe44/kPLcNQjtR3YbM5N9CgkfxGKHbi6Ug33RwCLcB/s320/IMG_20170321_202340.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Haha that's all you get; I'm doing this PG (dammit)<br />And also, ignore the guy behind her lol</td></tr></tbody></table>Initially in the process of getting the release I thought to settle with a postcard which technically does not have her (okay it's a drawing of her?) so I'd be glad if <b>Animate Online Shop</b> will give me a chance to get the folder instead... and they did. Thanks to the many people who though this release wasn't good (I beg to differ look at this post) so that I can still order this on release day (which is a rarity in Animate btw) so I won't end up with a postcard drawing lol. Other than that, you'd be relieved that the more money you pay the lesser of the artist you get to see haha (refer to Sayuri, Yuuki Aira and then this)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dL4H-AszDlo/WNEmloP4oII/AAAAAAAAe48/fMRmP1a4FbAK-Pd1WkWxKvw7q5Ccv4pSgCLcB/s320/IMG_20170321_204129.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Also, I'm not joining the gift campaign because I'll be paying a lot more than a 52yen stamp lol<br />(FYI it's until the end of the month)<br />I'd like to fill up the feedback portion of the card though.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br />This is it then. I have to finish this quick because it's a weekday and I have a job *sob* Cya guys next time, and guess who is going to be reviewed next? Hey, I have no idea yet but we'll see. This month is such a strong start to this year's reviews, I don't want to stop.<br /><br />P.S. You guys want an image of Kuroneko-san in 2D? Meh, go Google it yourself haha. Also, ACCA promotion card in package!! Lol I'm such a fanboy.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
