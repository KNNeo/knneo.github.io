<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #10</h2>
And with today coming to a close I've given two singles to be placed on my shelf. Yuuki Aira will be ordered later, okay? I just haven't gotten to terms with such a single. Well, considering Aki-chan's got it worse I think I can accept that lol<br /><br />Hey the Anime below is literally the best this season, I'm not lying. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Haha let's get started.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>ACCA 13th District: </b>Now the truth is out, I don't know what to say. Even the ending theme featuring (supposedly) Princess Schnee dancing is sad.<br />In the latest episode (8), turns out that it has always been a plan all along. It's no wonder many around are doubting Jean's identity, well also because why Grossular will be vital in the next part of this story. Later about him, let's talk about a history lesson. (Haha I like how this is only a small part of the King's life haha) (Also the Privy Chairman's) (I wonder who's older lol) It's about thirty years ago that the Princess decided to leave royalty for the world. For there is no one else to fight for the throne the youngest princess who bears a heir shall likely be the successor. And I think we can believe why the King hasn't given up his throne just yet. Surprisingly, Nino's father (I'll take it as the real one) has pledged allegiance to royalty, and serves them to be an observer to the Princess' future lifestyle. Whether it has been marrying a poor man, having two kids (yep you're right they are Jean and Lotta-chan respectively) and then dying in a train accident with Nino's father... it was supposedly all according to plan. I kind of hate if it's like that, but seeing how reaction-less Jean is after hearing the story, I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Then again, the intro did emphasise well on living the existence, well Nino (who we don't know his previous name) chose to be with his father on his reporting missions to the King, and the Princess did choose to be free. I cannot express enough that you should understand this episode as a decision making point, than think of it as a conspiracy against yourself for not knowing anything. Also, what happens ahead is also pretty unpredictable, considering now many know of this story. Then again Nino is right - Jean is not going to be taking the throne. Or could he? Hey, the King's decision is final, I would say.<br />P.S. Kudos to MVP of this episode Yuuki Aira (I just followed translations lol) for the ending theme and insert songs in this week's release respectively. I have a feeling this is going to be first on my shelf this year.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e798Gect2eQ/WLbQ4Y4_hhI/AAAAAAAAeY0/6nxhmZAA_BExkq-g2vllBnuiC0AqZ6FGQCLcB/s320/acca08_photos.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Some may be sketchy, but they are great photos.<br />It's hard being Nino, fulfilling the duty for his dad and such.<br />(Then again he can don't do it?)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.P.S. And I think we now can guess with some accuracy that Nino is reporting to - you guessed it - (I'm talking about the superior) the Privy Council people. But hey, Grossular wants a cut too??<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>Wow that was really quite an episode. Please don't tell me this is the climax for this show.<br />The new episode (20) continues on Shimada's journey to being the master, and yeah, to save you the trouble of watching to the end, he took his fourth defeat, but not like a champ. Apparently Kiriyama got to be an official observer for an audience (that do this very often in shougi tournaments of that scale) and noticed the cheap trick Souya pulled out too. Oh well, guess not everything anyone can see, but hey, Shimada is also tired. Of a lot of things. As shown in his dreams, as shown of him hiding from people talking behind his back, as shown of people around him being real a-holes and with "talking about experience" blabbering out of their mouth than along with their brains, it would seem it takes a lot just to be a master in that field. But guess what? No one went as far as Shimada did, so suck it all a-holes. If he didn't see the speck of light in the darkness I'm going to blame on everybody else who didn't put trust in the challenger than that master who probably should be replaced by an AI by now. Interesting part is, they never got to a story on Souya at any point, so we don't know who he is, actually. Season two maybe? We can but hope. On the other hand, Souya did make a light reply on solving his trick move, so I guess there's some human in him. Or so I think.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a2F0g-IpXU4/WLuC42r8NmI/AAAAAAAAebo/URM_pfjV_8ov0NghfV1598AmpgMMyrouwCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion20_mic.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You know how you're nervous so you hold the mic with two hands?<br />I'll hold two hands to whack that jerk beside me till he falls lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Not as crazy as KimiUso because the pacing here is definitely better, but still. If you need long journeys to success/defeat this show is for you. Or you can just watch their upcoming real-life movie.<br /><br /><b>Demi-chan wa Kataritai: </b>Haha you be glad no one bought watermelons. Okay, it's not funny; let's move on. *laughs uncontrollably*<br />The new episode (9) of the show which I picked up last week talks about many things it seems, including succubus and summer stuff. I swear Yocchan (that married woman who voices Satou-sensei haha) must feel weird making all the weird sounds in the studio but hey, this comes with experience haha. In other things, Yuki-chan seems to do well with embarrassment that brings her cold sweat (I mean, she can just go hug a guy or something and the cold will immediately happen lol), and Machi is bad at telling jokes. Toss that in with a blockhead of a Takahashi-sensei for a man, and you got yourself a funny show to watch every week. No really, I'm just here for the laughs. On other things, Satou-sensei seems to be enjoying the manga lol, and we may yet see more of her next week. Hey, I like myself some juicy watermelons. I just don't want to be spasm-ing while looking at it haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k-bVERRFTJg/WLuLJFMTSXI/AAAAAAAAecA/Ng3hLuVUf6oYpfaoki3wJfoHNCeLXzZhQCLcB/s320/demichan09_takahashi.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How do blockhead faces look like retard faces too?<br />Well I guess "is that a woman" is also part of a blockhead's quote haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Bear in mind Takahashi-sensei is no blockhead; he's just good at concealing it. A bit too good, to say the least. Then again if I know of a succubus I'm better off jerking off at a corner instead haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>No, and no. No manga this week, and no movies too. I mean, I'm busy playing games, that's why. Then again, I need to catch up on Acchi Kocchi, huh.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is a week of releases. Just as compelling as last week for some, this week is also quite disappointing for a few. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/f7/44/9a/f7449a59-5590-8ef5-4b2a-7e61c02f72a2/source/170x170bb.jpg" /> Sayuri's new single</abbr></b> turned out to be more acceptable than I thought, <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/34/61/6a/34616aee-688c-3e8f-9133-8aae112f4539/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Yuuki Aira's new single </abbr></b>which is also anime ACCA's ending theme is purely just good because of a certain insert song for this week's episode (no, it's really a coincidence), <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/87/bc/1f/87bc1f37-eeb6-c1d3-d09f-0ac4100a9c49/source/170x170bb.jpg" />KANA-BOON's new single</abbr></b> is not inside my brain yet even though it's the first few that I heard of, and <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/13/1f/60/131f6065-6f57-c334-a75d-061f4a01b540/source/170x170bb.jpg" />SPECIAL OTHERS collaboration album</abbr></b>... let's say I want an instrumental version of the album. Then again, does not remind me AT ALL of the previous album they did with six other groups back in 2011. Really, it doesn't. I'll sort the others out next week, but for now be glad two new singles are going to be only shelf. Stay tuned for reviews in the near future, possibly next weekend.<br /><br />Update on last week's two albums ended up with me giving <b>Kana-chan's new album</b> just one song (seriously hard to give I would say, even Okii Reiji doesn't stand a chance), and <b>miwa's new album</b> a couple. Really, her album is starting to feel like a movie soundtrack. Maybe it's all the references that has got to do with it. Competition is fierce, miwa-chan, and it's up to you to not write such <strike>plain </strike>types of songs at this stage of your music career.<br /><br />Okay, next week. Technically nothing, but if you've been following my Twitter account you'd know of <b>a lot of releases coming in the following weeks and next month</b>, especially. Many are also getting their rare once-in-a-while (or even their first) Anime credits which include THE ORAL CIGARETTES, Ajikan, Yoru no Honki Dance and so on. Literally next season <b>Anime "Eromanga Sensei"</b> who was written by dear manga artist who did Oreimo covers two artists I know of for theme songs: ClariS for opening and TrySail for ending. Next month is going to be great.<br /><br />Oh, on another important thing I heard of. Appears that in their recent live performances <b>sphere has announced their hiatus</b> on releases and live performances but not other stuff like radio programs (thanks Ayahime for clarifying) "in preparation for 10th anniversary" in 2019. Yeah, they say so, but if you do know of the Anime industry which is literally packed with people who can sing, these girls aren't going to stand a big chance at scoring much considering sales from the past few years haha. Also, the same company also hosts TrySail, their next big thing. Putting that into account, you'd know why they want to focus on the juniors instead. But seriously, I'll miss them. As a group. Individually... hey I know I'm starting to like Ayahi-chan haha<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm off to ordering that Anime ending single before all the special gifts run out. Well, at this point (four days AFTER release) I hope I even get to take the leftovers. Fingers crossed. Cya guys next week, my work is going well if you know I can slack off at my desk, and until next time... Man, times flies fast. It's March already. For Klassic Note that's really slow. I am NOT starting strong this year.<br /><br />[P.S. Well I don't know if I ended up with my last choice which requires a proxy order from my country that charges shipping higher than the average I do from my usual proxy service... Ah what the heck might as well try it haha. Wish me luck.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
