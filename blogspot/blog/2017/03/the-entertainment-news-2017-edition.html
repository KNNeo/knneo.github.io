Hey, I'm back! Man, halfway through internship liao. Really feeling lethargic already, not to mention my uncle just came over and I have to share the room with my sis who doesn't sleep <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> I'm going to crash tomorrow morning haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>ACCA 13th District: Honestly saying, I've been watching truths for quite a lot of episodes now, and the recent ones only tell me that it's not just protecting ACCA that is going to drive this nation. And I wasn't wrong. Really, not that tough to see through the Lilium family by now.<br />This new episode (11) talks about Furawau, the last district Jean is ordered to visit. Little do we not notice that every district has been handing to him a unique cigarette (yeah maybe it's just me) to symbolise acknowledgement of the coup, but that's not all. I can now not be able to remove from my brain the fact that Jean is likely going to be controlled by Grossular who in turn will be controlled by the Lilium family. I mean, it sounds like good intention without the feel of changing autocracy, but hey, I may be wrong. If you need a perspective on how the next episode will be a cliffhanger, then let me tell you this - I'd rather believe that the nation is smart just like the Lilium family and Jean is smarter than them so to know when not to be controlled (ie. ACCA against Lilium, the royal family and Privy Council maybe) than believe that the nation is dumb for following along like Jean and the Lilium family is the smart one for being able to control everything. As anything in life, you can't have control of everything. Then again, I say this with the assumption of lack of knowledge, meaning I don't know any of what power they might have physically (I mean, I can count heads, but I don't know about tanks lol) and what underdog events might still happen. Hey, no one said Nino and the King are at this point down.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zMeovoZNLLs/WNJsR3BPs3I/AAAAAAAAe5c/a05MuX2Bk7MwVrTnRJqCGDCtH8M7bA3bACEw/s1600/acca11_prince.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zMeovoZNLLs/WNJsR3BPs3I/AAAAAAAAe5c/a05MuX2Bk7MwVrTnRJqCGDCtH8M7bA3bACEw/s320/acca11_prince.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Trivia time! Read the headlines in Japanese.<br />(Hint is in the subtitles if you need them xD)<br />Man that a-hole's unhappy face...</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. MVP for this episode goes to... Eider! Hey, she knew how to let go. "But I have no intention to be queen" was probably what got her laid haha<br /><br />Demi-chan wa Kataritai: This was an easy ending, if you get what I mean.<br />The last episode (12) talks about light-hearted stuff, apparently. I mean, if you reserve the school's pool for the ladies (and Takahashi-sensei himself personally haha) on a Saturday it's either you're too kind or you don't think this is a harem at all. That's what I think though, but hey, it doesn't hurt to think. Talking about thoughts, there's a lot more going on between them. Machi-san thinking about folklore and being underwater (lol why didn't she do it until now? then again I thought it wasn't waterproof?), Yuuki-san giggling to puns lol, Satou-sensei really showing off her "nice body" and Hikari-chan talking about being a demi. No really, vampires is just a topic here. Watching through this show brings out a lot of understanding, I must say. Even classmates who aren't with them now even came into the pool on the weekend. That, is some cohesion right there. And that part of the show I will miss. Then again, there's the jokes, the thoughts, the sad scenes, and the ripped bodies (lol) and all, so that's that.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UCO9BYyUA74/WNc2q0IeStI/AAAAAAAAe88/eM5EE8w2hjkMcefH7a23t6iMNcG-zq0RACEw/s320/demichan12_hikari.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yeah, because this show doesn't show panties lol #notairantou<br />Boy am I glad this is as such haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Second season please! Even though this would be quite enough haha<br /><br />Also, ending this season's Anime next week with ACCA, and starting with the new season, I summarise my reading of the <a href="http://randomc.net/2017/03/25/spring-2017-preview/" target="_blank">Random Curiosity post</a> along with recent Twitter promotions (no really, the voice actresses are doing it) and upcoming music credits on Anime for Spring 2017:<br />- Titan S2 (because I feel obliged to watch even after Erenâ€™s mom got killed)<br />- Alice to Rozoku (if itâ€™s not Usagi Drop extreme and the trailerâ€™s playing the ending song Iâ€™m in)<br />- Tsuki ga Kirei (I like the final year vibe here along with very unsettled romantic feelings)<br />- Eromanga Sensei (totally in already because of theme songs and Oreimo author)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>A Channel: The new chapter (93) talks about Nagi-chan and her forbidden relationship with <strike>Tooru</strike> Fizzy the cat, and yeah, it brings out so many emotions of her, and I like. Like Tooru mentioned, she should get her own pet. Even if it means taking care of it or buying it a lot of presents or playing with it until she gets tired lol man taking care of pets is tough haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S179aA15aFc/WNe2xtn7UtI/AAAAAAAAe94/Dn6AdfDhYTgc8E2jSDn5Plli-Gh7VB_VQCLcB/s1600/img000006.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="141" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S179aA15aFc/WNe2xtn7UtI/AAAAAAAAe94/Dn6AdfDhYTgc8E2jSDn5Plli-Gh7VB_VQCLcB/s200/img000006.png" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A tiny image for some tiny love xD</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Well... not much this week though. Also for next week. That doesn't sound like good news considering I'm just busy all weekday, but <a href="../../2017/03/the-klassic-note-apple-music-japan.html" target="">hey I still got Apple Music</a> haha. On other news, I think I'm prepared for next month, and I'll elaborate on that next week then. Meanwhile, I may just go on a nostalgia trip in preparation for KN10YEARS (currently my plans for Klassic Note 10th anniversary) and yeah, I'm digging up the blog drafts to do up weekly posts like this too until the end of the year. Probably starting from the middle of the month if I got enough to talk about. I'll try; it's been ten years.<br /><br />On the other hand, I concluded <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/4a/0c/23/4a0c23db-f324-b54c-ca1a-5ca2cb613416/source/170x170bb.jpg" />YUKI's new album </abbr></b> with an emotional song that sounds like it's written by Ikimonogakari lol and <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/4f/f9/9c/4ff99cd7-a55f-0407-c2d9-cf16f41eaf9a/source/170x170bb.jpg" />LuckLife's major debut first album</abbr></b> is a disappointment as a rock album because it's even more generic than UNLIMITS, which is actually not boring.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm tired and I have a mountain of stuff I have not been doing because I'm drilling on mobile games and I have a ton of content to catch up on excluding new songs to put on Klassic Note<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
