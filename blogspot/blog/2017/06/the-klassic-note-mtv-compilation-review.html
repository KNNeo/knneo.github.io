<h2>The Klassic Note MTV Compilation Review #56</h2>
I may not be doing any more of this after all, just so you know. Because sometimes, I don't really have anything to say about most of the videos. Moreover, I'm the listening type. Music videos and visual aids ain't got anything on me- Oh PON-chan kawaii!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />Okay, let's get to it, this... last review post for music videos. Well, if things get more exciting than PON-chan dancing the next time I compile one of these I'll reconsider haha<br /><br />Please refer to my <strike>first</strike> <a href="http://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-klassic-note-mtv-compilation-review_30.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> for the format of this post and how the original compilation is done.<br /><br /><br />THE MTV COMPILATION #56<br />(*In compilation order, excluding Anime theme song animations. Ratings are not qualitative to any standard)<br /><br />02 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/QfiGNvMKDc8?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">happy/SpecialThanks</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="924" data-original-width="924" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E6XcKC8cgvk/WTOi3-5mPjI/AAAAAAAAf94/n5yo9sLnpzw02jrBnXCVc2WVQSpU_ZcHgCPcB/s320/happy.jpg" width="120" /></div>First impressions aren't that impressive though, and here I talk about music first. But then the music video is well done as is shows a lot of the band with some tweaks which will make you feel comfortable with. Nonetheless, this rather emotional song is here to make you happy, so I guess it does, so that's good.<br />Rating: 7 out of 8 flower circles on Misaki-chan; I didn't get to put one<br /><br /><br /><br />03 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/FhNfC2bPPRY?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">HEARTRAIL/Komatsu Mikako</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1072" data-original-width="1072" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M6i6HUwrB4s/WTOjathcIzI/AAAAAAAAf94/vIRh27wsZkgfRwlrePBZ_twSriN1ePPqQCPcB/s320/HEARTRAIL.jpg" width="120" /></div>This one is surprising though, the music video, in terms of how it's produced. The phase shifts between scenes and clever use of camera angles is making this more intriguing than the song itself. It also features a rabbit man and an acting younger version of Mikakoshi for some reason, but hey, can't beat the main girl here, eh?<br />Rating: 10 out of 10 cutscenes with only Mikakoshi in it<br /><br /><br />05 Hitorigoto/ClariS<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1036" data-original-width="1036" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7CYNDfEwAcc/WTOjh8TIDQI/AAAAAAAAf94/N0CX3wQx1TQaS3LNBxWpmPFGEzadDnr3wCPcB/s320/Hitorigoto.jpg" width="120" /></div>This is definitely no doubt, first of its kind as the duo feature themselves in their own music video. Despite it only being silhouettes, the video is done really well in portraying their actions and most importantly, the dancing, just like their 2D counterparts over the past few years. Personally, I'm just excited to see even a shadow of their true form, which we will no doubt be able to see them soon, as I've heard.<br />Rating: 6 out of 8 close-ups for Clara and Karen xD<br /><br /><br />07 Imakoko/Touyama Nao<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="924" data-original-width="924" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6BVPoAvCFk8/WTOjoAfc4mI/AAAAAAAAf94/bK3ski16h9IMxWsULfGVXi8GGAVmrnk_gCPcB/s320/Imakoko.jpg" width="120" /></div>This one, huh. The music video starring voice actress Touyama Nao (25) is quite literally, as she said in the making, her first attempt to act in a school-based music video. Considering it's only her 2nd single thus far, and that she's not that young, she's perfect for the schoolgirl role, trying to hand love letters and stuff. This, and its purity compared to the Anime tie-up, seems to be a perfect combination between song and video.<br />Rating: 4 out of 4 attempts of giving love letters to that guy we don't know<br /><br />08 Kachou Fuugetsu/Aimer<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1014" data-original-width="1014" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1b3T9w-bFlk/WTOjuveMy3I/AAAAAAAAf94/IsBvmyj3d8oEbXiAjXrl9z-PcbrJQqP-ACPcB/s320/KachouFuugetsu.jpg" width="120" /></div>For your usual Aimer music video which doesn't feature her, this one is special in that it's done with paper-cutting 2D animation. I guess it looks pretty good, it has a hidden story, it fits the emotional song nicely too... All in all a nice music video, even though I don't remember much about it anyways.<br />Rating: 1 out of 2 hearts broken in this music video<br /><br /><br /><br />09 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/coSWSPf3S20?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">Oretachi no Susumu Michi wo Kanashimi de Tozasanaide/Sambomaster</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="670" data-original-width="670" height="120" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eMyLis1Gq1c/WTOj0j7RbDI/AAAAAAAAf94/kehc3FgXwHcgcLVOHOgw-LnT8ubJPpLtwCPcB/s320/oresumumichi.jpg" width="120" /></div>To talk about music videos that have plot in this compilation, this one takes the top. Sambomaster sings about female empowerment and this video's story shows it all. Support, encouragement, consolation... this one's got it all. A little awkward to stop and read a letter, but it's part of the plot, and I like it actually.<br />Rating: 5 out of 10 times the ballet dancer should've started crying<br /><br /><br /><br />10 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/LjtLq1Qy3nc?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">pulse/cinema staff</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="900" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sTRJ4XD-tts/WTOj51_mi_I/AAAAAAAAf94/hQ3zLnkU-_o_inYbnSOmcJEH5mVh0XKwQCPcB/s320/pulse.jpg" width="120" /></div>If you find the thumbnail image familiar, you're not alone. cinema staff themselves deliberately mentioned that it is the sequel to the infamous song back in 2013 that is "great escape", and this music video takes many scenes from that street and that familiar tunnel once again. With the same production under the belt, it just looks reminiscent but more importantly, awesome in all aspects.<br />Rating: 9 out of 10 times got spooked by the guy with the jacket<br /><br /><br />11 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/DF8nZjHs_Sc?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">tokyo Sunset/SpecialThanks</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="593" data-original-width="593" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jMbye5a2M8k/WTOkAF_gdOI/AAAAAAAAf94/khAAc3nOk-EHAFQlW-8R9l_yUOMTjcqcgCPcB/s320/tokyo.jpg" width="120" /></div>This might be a lyric video (ie. a music video which features lyrics laid on top of simple backgrounds), but it's all the vocalist Misaki "writing" on the sketchpad, so I won't complain of the fanservice. Then again, this song is simple, people in YouTube mentioned about this song following YUI's style of music for some reason, but if it sounds good I'll take it. And Misaki-chan of course haha<br />Rating:7 out of 10 times I'm concerned about lack of close-ups<br /><br />13 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/BQazzq4BwgU?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">umahashiru/SpecialThanks</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="636" data-original-width="636" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ln0Y7VeFi-s/WTOkC9FUFDI/AAAAAAAAf94/36COPdRuDocKlTYUDIOsmv5JYdq1gJkPQCPcB/s320/umahashiru.jpg" width="120" /></div>Cowboy hype as you watch this very lively music video. Putting the band in a camera circle doesn't stop them from expressing the song itself, as they don up ye old Western gear and riff to the fast tempo of this song. Oh, not to forget about that horse that pops up every now and then too; that's the highlight. Pity it's a short melody though, I kind of enjoyed it.<br />Rating: 16 out of 10 rounds the cameraman took on the guide rail<br /><br /><br />15 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/5-9s4DUfBLs?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">Wonder Drive/ORESAMA</a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="824" data-original-width="824" height="120" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YxunwsPkjU0/WTOkFZKLMDI/AAAAAAAAf94/s8_ciMDxUE0CN1KrNBNxwFZBn-55FtzLgCPcB/s320/wonderdrive.jpg" width="120" /></div>Oh man, where should I start. Featuring the best Anime opening theme this season, the best CG effects for manipulating scenery and surrounding animations on the cutest pop group vocalist I've seen thus far, and PON-chan is likely going to win this year's best music video haha. I feel for <a href="https://twitter.com/pon_oresama/status/858955985800630275" target="_blank">her commenting about wearing TWO uncomfortable wigs on her Twitter account</a>&nbsp;(the blonde and blue haired are both her), but it turned out real good. And when I mean 'real good' I meant 'I can die happy now' awesome!!~<br />Rating: 200 out of 20 times I screamed at PON-chan dancing<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. Turns out I got a lot to talk about these music videos though haha. Stay tuned for Entertainment News tonight. Well, I don't have much to say for Klassic Note, but come on, you guys aren't here to read what I got to talk about music, right? Probably only for the Anime portion only, yes? So yeah, please do come back then if that's the case. See ya.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
