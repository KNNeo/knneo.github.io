Wow... it's been a week, huh. And two more weeks to that week I'll not like, and it'll decide my fate for the following month. I really need to pass that physical fitness test haha<br /><br />On other things, I got myself a new pair of glasses! Though I'm dumb enough to not get it in 20 minutes but choose it to take three days later. Four train stations away. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> That's what happens if you shop with your sister lol<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Alice to Zouroku:</b> Hmm... a weird episode though. Didn't know they would focus this much on that mysterious magic that is Dreams Of Alice since the action died down.<br />This new episode (8) talks about another of the ability users, and this girl Hatori seems to be able to turn anybody around her into soulless zombies who listen to her command. Or actually, anyone's command who is not affected by her "magic". Her best friend Ayumu seems to be holding well, and is the good side of her using her magic. As Hatori has mentioned herself, she has indeed become the evil user. As Ayumu follows her to seek the method to undo this magic, they meet Sana-chan, stuck in a town of zombies when Hatori decided to leave her house to "save her parents". I mean, good thing she also realises that her NOT using her powers will be saving the world already. Sana-chan may not have discovered the way to undo it, but at least her powers did. For the whole town. One thing pegs me though, because this thing affects the whole town why isn't Ichijou's surroundings also like this? And if for example Naito is stoning, can't she know that someone was behind this? I guess the confrontation isn't as fast as Sana-chan and the couple, but still. Nonetheless, it's a mystery to how things can be resolved at this point because all Hatori has done is to create more problems that never get resolved and getting away with it all the time, as she mentioned. Being human, at least we know this will come to a happy conclusion. Although I'm still freaked out. Freaked out by the tale itself. I mean, that is also why kids never understand things. As we learn through education, we know of things in a problem-solution model, for where we identify a problem and propose a solution for that specific problem. If Hatori knew she can be the middleman between making her parents happy again, things would have been different. I'm just saying.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OlrJuLBba0c/WTEnYcFzHAI/AAAAAAAAf4Q/OphPpM1RrCAiW8r-usI0Br0D5_pwOPFWgCLcB/s320/alicezouroku08_hatori.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I thought Sana-chan crying was cute, but I'll let the main girl stay.<br />She's also cute, this Hatori-chan.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I guess Sana-chan wins for MVP this week, considering she cried so much. But that Santa Claus thing is a no-go. Remember what Zouroku told you? Don't anyhow use your powers- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING USING MAGIC TO TIE UP THE CARDBOARD BOXES???!!!<br /><br /><b>Tsuki ga Kirei: </b>Still cringing? Fret not, for the show is surely going to make you cringe right to the end. Okay, now I don't want it to end haha<br />The new episode (8) talks about summer, it seems. (The title is no indication, but suffice it to say - and thanks to Bungou Stray Dogs - is a book title from Dazai) The couple is now known to the school to say the least, and then later to the neighbourhood pretty much because Kotarou's friend can't keep his mouth shut lol, but yeah, the cat's literally out of the bag. On other things, the couple go to the summer festival together, had lunch together in school, kissed (this time without a kid lol), and many much more. I mean, for this episode at least we see Akanecchi showing more initiative in the relationship, and as she mentioned, Kotarou likes to keep a lot of stuff to himself, including those initiatives. Which is easily why she doesn't stop him if ever he wants to take action, like kissing. But hey, what do I know of relationships? I don't even have one. But watching this sweet romance tale makes me cringe a lot, and if not for their approach of less talk more action (I mean, they've talked the most this episode in this series) their relationship wouldn't have gone this well. Kotarou now has that squeezie Akanecchi has, she knows of his external club activity, and all is well. No really, no Chinatsu interfering. No Hira-kun tipping it to everyone else. Damn, these two are a-holes haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6kT3NYGzYxk/WTEuSzb2TaI/AAAAAAAAf4c/63vQ0ElI2oMVMU7_lDxUQ3T7LQRH0I4SQCLcB/s320/tsukigakirei08_akane.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"No secrets from now, Akanecchi"<br />Yeah right, who will be dumb enough to tell you girls we kissed already haha</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXd32pzHZaI/WTEucB9nakI/AAAAAAAAf4g/2ra8wo_TFc0Q7wF78710h13ngnEUShtYwCLcB/s320/tsukigakirei08_potato.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Really, where can I buy this in real life?<br />I saw a lot of them shown in the official Twitter account, so it must exist.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Wow that's a lot of short stories at the end there, so let's talk about them. Aira is WAY hotter than that idol in the magazine (really, who drew that weird-) (also, kudos to the bf getting it right), Miu is being a d**k to his male friend as usual (so it's not bgr?), weird why the teacher is thinking of Roman so much lol, and someone changed her lip gloss? I mean, there's so much in life, the anime production's finding it hard to cram all this story in haha<br />P.P.S. I also would like to compliment on the author of this show emphasising (I guess anime production too, but still) a lot on traditional stuff, scenery and all the events in between. From seeing summer festivals in detail, giving the couple traditional interests like Literature and sports and not like some nerdy stuff, to watching them get involved and interested in each other's interests really brings a lot of understanding to me. Or to the intended audience in general. Now I want to go to Japan lol<br />(<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/06/02/tsuki-ga-kirei-08/comment-page-1/#comment-2275049" target="_blank">My comment in RC</a>)<br /><br /><b>Eromanga-sensei: </b>No really, WHO THE F**** MADE THAT ENDING THEME ANIMATION??? WHO??? So half-assed though, seriously. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />The new episode (9) pretty much turned into those kind of lewd ecchi Anime I don't want to watch, but at least the show knows how to hold back. We're introduced to Elf's brother Chris, and yeah this is pretty much a Yamada Elf episode. You know, just like those harem Anime there must be a focus episode for each of the girls. Muramasa got hers, and now it's this girl's turn. As much as those romantic practices for gathering data are fun and interesting, it'll not get over the fact that someone is thinking about marriage. Well, Masamune is right about falling in love with her (if not for liking his stepsister already) many times, because I probably did too (not for the body, unfortunately; I'll take Muramasa ten times over those two kids haha), and I guess that's what led up to the ending. I guess it's no confession, but it's a hint. Another girl likes the main guy a lot again. Now you'd wish you're the main guy of a harem haha. Nonetheless, a great way to end the episode with tsundere Elf-sensei for sure, and who knows what's going to happen next.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ax3VnWX4xlQ/WTN0Mxcx3pI/AAAAAAAAf84/rn1EV92Lh3QRKJJnDLoCCDNLBHqB5mfYQCLcB/s320/eromangasensei09_mansion.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">As usual, there is that one rich person in an Anime series.<br />So, so stereotypical of a summer beach episode.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Attack on Titan S2:</b> The new episode (35) moves on to the plan Reiner and... whoever that is, have planned. They saw the Scouts though, so they have to leave. Ymir though, has other plans. For example, meeting Christa, meeting Christa, and meeting Christa etc... well you know. But then, she isn't that dumb to follow the plan. To say, she has a better plan. So yeah, she turned Titan, waited for Christa to appear with the Scouts, and left with her intention with success. I guess that's a good plan to say the least because Ymir doesn't want her relation with Christa to just end here, but hey, the group has other plans. The Scouts may be chasing them down, but these guys might just be able to escape scot-free. We shall have to see, for the next and last episode of the season will show us whether things will happen their way or will the Scouts ever have to fight any of them. Well, the preview hints on Commander Erwin staking out a plan, so we shall see if anyone is going to emerge winner in this fish and bait contest.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-slKTvpdfNgM/WTN6zL6WY5I/AAAAAAAAf9A/J-kZuCkESa4uuu5DTXf5mjBTM6UbGn8KQCLcB/s320/attackontitan35_ymir.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Turns out Ymir is also a "higher-being" in her past.<br />Little does Christa know, their fates are very similar.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>Wow. Just wow. The new chapter (62) talks about... Yocchan.

Her clean freak friend Miporin (this one I remember haha, but not her real name) can't stand her not cleaning after herself and offers to clean it up for her, along with Tooru.

I'll talk about why next week then.<br /><br />I spend the weekend then looking for new songs (well, more), and this group called <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFWqLLaMOFs&amp;list=WL" target="_blank">Middle Kids</a></b> sounded pretty good, thanks to recommendation from Gotch (Ajikan vocalist) on his Twitter account. That's all for now, but next week onwards (I think I have three weeks without releases) I'll probably be searching for new songs, if I've not been spending too much time surfing YouTube or playing games haha<br /><br /><br />That's it for this week. Cya guys next week, and by then two new reviews will be up. Be sure to check out the latest music video review post I did today too. Eh... until next time, stay cool. Like, the weather's hot in my place. Hope it's not on yours. Or if you live in the south hemisphere, if you get geography.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not going to hype on anything because thinking of going for runs in the morning makes me want to sleep more lol don't you? Maybe it's just me.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
