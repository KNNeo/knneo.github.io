<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #25</h2>
Ugh, another uneasy week ahead, next week. I know; conscription is terrible. *laughs*<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm entertained (a lot from RC) so I may be able to survive next week. Fingers crossed.<br /><br />Next week is also the start of my reduced data plan because my internship ended last month. Uh oh, shouldn't have done that. Then again, not like my phone battery will hold up. But there's the new game event starting on Tuesday... #firstworldproblems<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Alice to Zouroku: </b>"Ha! I'm really powerful! I've got my powers as the Red Queen and a whole bunch of pancakes as collateral to lose to you!" - Kashimura Sana, 2017<br />The episode (10) continues on confronting the couple on the Dreams of Alice, it seems. Sana-chan is really a very bad liar, making up all these things to get people to apologise even though (1) people apologise immediately because that's not why she should do this to them and, (2) she cannot confront on people. There is no resolution, basically. Hey, can we blame her? She has the EQ of like a three-year-old. On the other hand, she did listen to Ayumu's call on helping her friend Hatori out, but of course that didn't go any well either. To make things worse, Hatori used her powers and caused the inner world housing Sana-chan and her to collapse, causing massive spawns of Dreams of Alice in the real world, and finally, Ichijou gets worried. Two things we have learnt here. Firstly, the research facility is not closed. It has been occupied by the police to monitor the Wonderland (which it is called) which is (I assume) the core of Sana-chan's imaginative powers. And then, there's Ichijou. Why now? Why only when there's a problem? Then again, is there really a solution? In a predicament where two ability users seemingly lost their power trapped in the alternative world, can even anyone get in there to patch things up? I don't know, because this is all magic. But I'm interested, to even see if there is any form of conclusion to this weird mess. Hey, it's Sana-chan who continued this fight first.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FhE0vB9FuSk/WUPHRkSQqNI/AAAAAAAAgQc/SRk02xy3BUsOGvqhtrf6-XGRwPtzz-XvACLcBGAs/s320/alicezouroku10_sana.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Just because it's cute and Sana-chan looks stupid in it lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. "Only one person is left who really cares about me." Haha could it be *pfft* 'your mother'?? lol<br /><br /><b>Tsuki ga Kirei: </b>Say it! You want this relationship to go on for another two years? SAY IT!! (lol that's me as Akane when pestering Koutarou)<br />The new episode (10) is such an emotion roller coaster, I'm going crazy over it already. We are reminded on the various events that will be happening, including Koutarou finally starring as the acting summoner (I guess?) for the Kawagoe Festival, and Akane going to the festival with her track club mates for their last trip. Anxious that a particular someone might be lost, Hira finally took the time to confess to Akane, of course, to be rejected by her. Funny thing is Hira actually thought he had a chance this whole time until Koutarou appeared, being the narrow-minded person he is. No really, I don't care, that Hira-kun. On other things, Koutarou obviously knew about it, and is getting jealous. She made Akane sad about it (Koutarou you son of a b*tch YOU'RE JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER lol), but then finally, Akane took the initiative to make up with him. Hey, I must say it once again, from the hugs to the kisses to the crying, Akane is MVP of this episode. Never before have I seen a romance story take a turn this bad and supposedly patch up this well. Koutarou, you're damn lucky to have someone who actually cares for once in your life. Well, it may be a little less subtle, and it may take a few days (I mean, patching up immediately would be better of course, but you know this show), but still. All is well with the happiest couple in the world (screw Koutarou's mother, please), and I can't wait to see what's next. Considering their circumstances, I must say this is going to be some long-distance love. Well, not unless Akane stays at Koutarou's cram school and Koutarou actually goes to the high school Akane is already going. Ah, such is youth. Promises made are so fulfilling, so directed, so... romantic.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1440" data-original-width="1280" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nav_IUqnykw/WUPQIpemCeI/AAAAAAAAgQs/Bd3bEKwJTqs7arA-x5530fdMk_x2h5cOwCLcBGAs/s320/tsukigakirei10_futari.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="284" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No Akane wasn't eating a fortune cookie lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Sorry to say that but my prediction of Koutarou appearing where Hira <strike>confessed to</strike> was alone with Akane was spot on. Totally nailed it. Good thing my prediction thereafter was wrong since Koutarou did mention about it after Akane pestered him for a while. Man, I wished some girl will do that to me haha<br />P.P.S. Shout-out to the school's Literature Club (ie. Koutarou only haha) for hiring a bunch of temps to pose for the graduation picture lol<br />(<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/06/17/tsuki-ga-kirei-10/comment-page-1/#comment-2277844" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>)<br /><br /><b>Eromanga-sensei: </b>I like how the ending depicts Sagiri to like, have some disability lol "I've always been practising" to get out of the house? I've been doing that for YEARS!!<br />The new episode (11) somehow concludes on the main story, as seeing the preview of next episode (also likely series finale) it might just be filler. We got a flashback on how the main couple became the professionals they are now, and yeah, it's a lot of dream pursuing, but surprisingly they have been supporting each other this whole time. Find it familiar? You have not been paying attention to the previous episode with Muramasa. On the other hand, we see a couple of supporting parents (Masamune's father, the real Eromanga-sensei that is Sagiri's mother haha) to let their kids do whatever they want to, and allowing such a breeding on the Internet to exist. Well, maybe it's because of the single parent thing, but whatever. Such coincidences are then stacked against the fact that they have indeed met up with each other in the future as professionals and written THE story that they have always wanted to as a collaboration. Hey, what a nice ending, yes? Top it off with the highest amount of references from Tsukasa-sensei's (the author) previous work Oreimo, you can't make this any better. But hey, as I said, there's filler episode. And we've only seen Sagiri in a bikini, and sweating. Separately, but not both. My inner otaku wants that to happen, so let's see if this series will live up to its super stereotypical Anime standards.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gCQ8YIIuRIY/WUXmypG6hwI/AAAAAAAAgS4/UZ7TOifWyNs8wwKcocTSQVS7gXp9WRfiwCLcBGAs/s320/eromangasensei11_sagiri.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Sagiri 7 years old, now actively being a hikkimori*" lol<br />(*Hikkimori = a stay in)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. MVP Sagiri's mother. Totally sick in the mind, 100% influence on the daughter, and an expert in drawing. Now you wished your mother was like her.<br />P.P.S. I like to think that they got similar people to do the cast of this show from the start so they can reference to Oreimo like, in this episode lol. I mean, or else Nakamura Yuuichi (who voices the father here, the main guy there) will only have one "um?" to say lol the credits (yes I noticed that brat Kana is still doing lives in 2017 haha)<br /><br /><b>Attack on Titan S2: </b>The final episode of the season (37) concludes on the fighting. I'll not leave you speculating, but suffice it to say Ymir made a choice. To save the two traitors instead of staying with Christa, who, along with the other Scouts, managed to retrieve Eren back within the walls. Turns out Eren may be able to command Titans at will for some reason (I'm not going to spoil this because I read the Wiki), and this might be the game changer from here on. Thanks for the many who sacrificed for this season because it was worth it. It gave Ymir a reason to save the traitors, and gave Mikasa good time to "confess" to the guy she was always beside with. Hey, I'm just saying. On other things, Connie and Hannes deduced that humans are the ones who created Titans (which now can explain Eren's father and his research) to the commanders, and that got half-dead Erwin smiling for once. I know. Very creepy. To preview the new season (yes it's coming) next year we see once again that monkey of a Titan and someone on top of him. Hey, that's good enough to make me look forward to another season of this action. I just hope the theme songs can get better the next time round.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Lu4EmrBTMBA/WUXvFNMo_eI/AAAAAAAAgTI/rYS5n6zBuEw8IphgKYu2Yz3j689ZonfNQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan37_christa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Now this is what I call cool. I mean, Erwin's okay, but this. *laughs*</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. [MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS PARA] <span style="font-size: xx-small;">I read up the Wiki and Eren was supposedly crowned as one of the Founding Titans who can not only command on Titans but also take over their memories and stuff. Sounds pretty cool, but without much reason as far as this Anime goes thus far it doesn't mean anything. Maybe it's time to check out that basement lol</span><br />P.P.S. Because <strike>Christa</strike> Historia looked so cool this episode, MVP Historia!!! And you're welcome for the GIF below. I wished this was like, for a magical girl transformation lol but still the soundtrack was great on this one<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="270" data-original-width="480" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgxVaNr730o/WUXwh5bVCjI/AAAAAAAAgTU/IvNFg5P_M6UOIxaqswT8CeIAMvmiBoLCACLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan37_historia.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I swear the animation team had a hard time making this lol<br />(I meant the body shape haha)</td></tr></tbody></table>(<a href="http://randomc.net/2017/06/17/shingeki-no-kyojin-37/comment-page-1/#comment-2277847" target="_blank">My comment on RC</a>)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Kuroshitsuji: </b>The chapter that I haven't read (128) continues on when Sebastian and Ciel came back to notice the incident which happened in their stay-place. Agni was obviously killed, and Soma slapped Ciel in the face. Investigating the house, they find a knife slashed message on the wall and something dropping from Soma's hands to hint that Ciel may have known about something, and it may be someone we likely know. Problem is, why did he question Sebastian? Did he think Sebas-chan will fake death reports to make this incident happen? Then again, it makes you think who at this point hasn't been eliminated but still can be hunting for whatever Ciel has around him? I'd like to assume Jack the Ripper isn't dead yet, but that was like so long ago. Then again, it can be tied to Bravat I guess. The last time any incident is hugely tied to a character we know of is on the Atlantic ship, where the zombies on the ship have a mastermind called Undertaker. So yeah, it can just happen again. Then again, I don't know. Guess we may not have long to find out.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="835" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1uqBVuXLEgc/WUO_vivn46I/AAAAAAAAgQM/p7lp6QGUircgWJ85aEjOUA3_hC4yv_8mACLcBGAs/s320/kutoshitsuji128_005.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="296" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yeah, Grell wasn't lying.<br />But really, why the shinigamis know of death timing, I still don't know.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. But seriously, assuming Sebastian never told lies in this series (outside I don't know lol), then it's even weirder. Then it may not be someone who was revived, and this is really likely considering we don't know who that mysterious person Bravat is pumping the blood of half of London to, is. But seriously, unless they tell me in the face I won't consider this a possible deduction.<br /><br /><b>Konobi:</b> The new chapter (52) concludes (I'm using this word too often lol) on the library episode they had a couple of chapters ago. The President apparently had the book, and Usami landed on Uchimaki. Period. *laughs* Okay, maybe a little more. They were searching for the book, so it seems that it hasn't been borrowed out, so it's in the library. I don't know why the guy don't want them to take the book (so the search is over and they have to go back?) (I mean, he likes the air-con here lol), but hey, why the couple keeps landing on top of the other is also a mystery.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="528" data-original-width="290" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TPaWhPm7810/WUZh_GVd75I/AAAAAAAAgTk/SgG7o3SJgMMwCX6Ign6pviQclc-lj10EQCLcBGAs/s320/img000004.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="175" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I didn't mention this above, so I'll leave it to your imagination haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><strike>MOVIE</strike><br /><strike>John Wick:</strike><br />Maybe next week. I'm not in the mood right now. Also, that digital movie rental that I accidentally pressed which will expire will come first. It'll be a mystery for now, but I would say it's "fantastic" haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I reviewed a couple of releases this week instead of those I mentioned from last week. Yeah, I noticed there's a lot more that I know (or not) of which I can listen to this month. <b><a href="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/6c/b4/e6/6cb4e61c-9685-da6e-f9b9-42eeff503a82/source/313x0w.jpg" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new single</a></b> is okay for their standards which is nice in my opinion, and <b><a href="https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music127/v4/bf/f5/10/bff5104b-ba3e-9f18-76cd-a084416f17e6/source/313x0w.jpg" target="_blank">Numakura Manami's first album</a></b> is... I'm not blaming her here; the songs aren't good. <b>Ray's best album</b> (also her final release) is not going to make me like her singing voice anytime soon (her looks though, that's a different topic), and that XXL guy who has been famous online recently because of his new album... is not aligned to my listening style. Too much pop/beats, to be honest. <b><a href="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/24/7d/0f/247d0f99-68c5-a301-4d4e-d90e51f8eb7a/source/313x0w.jpg" target="_blank">wacci's latest single</a></b> turned in interesting with their unusual style, so I'll give it. Of course it took me a couple of clicks to confirm they are releasing an album after keeping quiet for a year (well not like I knew), so I may listen to that in August by then? I'll see about it.<br /><br />In other news, <b>thanks Apple Music for creating preview pages</b> in their website overhaul so I can share songs on Twitter now. I'll be doing that more often in the future, that's for sure. And yes, I'm assuming if it exists in Apple Music. Also, <b>Aki-chan's best album</b> is near with another month before release, and they released a half-an-hour trailer of her selection of top 15 songs. Hehe, region block won't stop me from watching that stuff, that's for sure. There's also the recently announced Taketatsu Ayana's best album incoming, but to vote for your best song (only one btw) you have to provide your name and address. Yeah, and you'll get more votes if you're a fanclub member. Very different from Tomacchan's best album back in last year, I must say. Oh well, not voting anyway I can't provide an address haha<br /><br />Next week brings in <b>negoto's new single</b> which I'm not interested in at the moment, so I don't know what to listen now. On the other hand, I didn't really record on things recently. Be sure to check out my Twitter for more though. Then again I'll be reminded when next Wednesday comes (okay I am suddenly remembered of <b>TWEEDEES' new single</b>), provided I even have the time to review anything this week.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. As you know I'm going green next week (and it's not because of vegetables lol), so my mood is changing to adapt to the slow pace over there. I'd rather stay at home and burn more hours on that awesome game which is Stardew Valley (recently bought it, and that is before I spent 70+ hours on it before haha), but hey, such is life. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... my sister wants to join the army? No you're not getting a follow-up on what will happen, especially if it's unlikely.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
