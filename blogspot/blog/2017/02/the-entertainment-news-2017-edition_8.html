<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #7</h2>
Damn, that was quite some live, I would say. Sorry for not mentioning about the cinema staff LINE LIVE in my Tweets. I thought I shouldn't disturb your dinner haha. No, I just don't think it's good, I guess. I mean, I've only heard like, one song from the setlist. Weird.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>ACCA 13th District: </b>Damn we got plenty of Lotta-chan today; so much that I can remember her name. I'm satisfied haha<br />This new episode (5) gives us more honest insights about what's happening around the coup, but I must say it makes me more confusing. As Jean continues to survey the districts, he meets one of the Five who hinted him about an observer leading to him being a suspect of a nation-wide rebellion, but then again as if Nino can do anything anyways, so yeah, telling on him is fine for now. Grossular though, is having a lot of opinions. He appears in the latest district Jean is in, and now it has come to this. I mean, you might as well ask one question and let's leave, yes? Don't start a gunfight in the West, please.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IAeDvU-lPVg/WJsqjEeuhII/AAAAAAAAeFI/EZYDKNubSUsrrq19pms4AvkVj5fKQmjwgCLcB/s320/acca05_bread.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Food porn! Damn even their bread looks great.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. The Prince is real dumb. His smartest aide got him clues about how to woo a girl and all he does is find out how rich her parents are? No wonder he didn't get the pass on. I'd create an assassination for him if I were the King. Also, didn't notice the intention of the Magie is just to make someone open toast shops in Dowa, the capital.<br />P.P.S. Oh? Eider aiming for next best girl in this show? Jean's a lucky guy, just in case you don't know. You must be real attractive for a girl to not mind a chimney haha<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>Wow another fantastic episode. I don't normally praise this show, but I have to. Now that things have gotten to its own usual pace once again. Just, a little different every time.<br />The new episode (17) talks about two main things, just about that Title Match Shimada cannot hold on to (I mean, we're dealing with a record-breaker, so I won't say much), and about Kiriyama's life in general, I guess. His "sister" Kyouka came by once again, and this time they met the Kawamoto sisters. But hey, I'm just saying. The drama though... I'd prefer if you watched it for yourself. On other things, if Kiriyama said things haven't changed, we have Nikaidou closing up to him in shougi rank, him joining a workshop run by the runner-up of the Title Match... I mean, what more do you want? Oh I want that b*tch to get out of my house. And never come back again. Guess who's the piece of sh*t tearing up a family. Turns out, our main guy is little to blame.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gtH703kyEGU/WJ_VAaIGdEI/AAAAAAAAeGg/JRs20GIUonkzpNTwDVP0IafvGu2a41MZACLcB/s320/sangatsunolion17_strangle.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">There are many to screencap, but this one is the funniest, I guess.<br />Yeah they drew Kiriyama's "dad" (left) to be so fat lol</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Hey b*tch rant time! Me as Kiriyama probably would get her out of my way, but then again his accommodating character makes him not be able to retard such a cynical a-hole out of his life, even though his is a whole lot better than her hanging out with a married man. I should be glad that relationship will never get further elaborated in this show, but still. If it's that case, Kiriyama then should consider taking care of Kyouka every once in a while as a family member (you know, he has his pay haha) and reporting everything to the father. Hey, it's still responsibility too, and no one will feel any wiser. I mean, Kyouka can b*tch all the way she wants, I'll just refer it to your dad if you don't mind haha (No really, I'm being VERY, VERY KIND here lol)<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>Nah, not reading anything this week. And nah, no movie substitute. Maybe next week. I need more sleep lol<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This is quite a week in Klassic Note, considering from last week I forgot that I actually have two albums to review other than the two singles I mentioned before. <b>TrySail's new single </b>has finally reached the trash bin (I'm sorry, girls) for personal reasons (I guess it just didn't leave any impression on me at all) and <b>Numakura Manami's new single</b> is quite okay. I'm getting hooked for some reason. I also took more time to tune in to Apple Music for <b>Coalamode's first album</b> which was okay per se, and then alao <b>7!!'s new album</b>, which was not so okay. The following Tweet summarises my review of the two albums.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">I thought Coalamode. was not good but I ended up giving two a chance. I thought 7!! will be good but I ended up trying to give two a chance.</div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/830453173898784768">February 11, 2017</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />And just in case you have not been reading this, or if you have been you would have missed the <b>LINE LIVE of cinema staff's new live tour performance</b>, and I must say it sounds rather great, even though it's mostly hyped up punk rock style tunes that I've not gotten addicted to at this point, but still. <b>amazarashi's new music video</b> looks erotically awesome (and "erotic" as in gore, not sex), the new releases from the Anime ACCA have been announced (yep, people I don't know), and that means I'll probably spend some time next week listening to ORESAMA maybe. I don't know. I noticed a very important thing: I do not have time to savour them all. I really need more time. Maybe it's good time to incorporate it into my busy weekday schedule. Or just burn mobile data using Apple Music, probably. I've ramped it up just in case. Data, I mean.<br /><br />On other other news, Yonezu Kenshi has been raking up quite a couple of tunes here, as his latest album is slowly entering my song list haha. No really, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa9PkDZkyHg&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">it's</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLEPU7DqLzg&amp;index=2&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">quite</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnQDnO1ov0c&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">good</a>, in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I've got new songs to give haha. Cya guys next week, and hopefully by then I'll be basking myself in more music than ever. Damn, I can't even slow down. I mean, case studies in the past are real easy. And now, I can't even bear to give a song from the cinema staff live just now. Maybe I'll give a listen somehow. Until next time, people. The weather here is getting windy. I better not get sick at any point now, really. Lunches have been harsh on my health and my wallet these days.<br /><br />[P.S. Is there anything else I missed? I hope not. I worry every week I may have missed anything I've seen or heard. But hey, I'm more worried about giving songs now. It's hard to keep an impression in my head. The Songs of the day are good evidence of this.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
