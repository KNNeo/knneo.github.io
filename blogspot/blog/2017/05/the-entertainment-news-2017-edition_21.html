<h2>The Entertainment News 2017 Edition Issue #21</h2>
Yeah, I just chose to do this later because personal grooming for next week is important haha. Also, every time I do this I get tired and bored about Sunday because Monday is approaching.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, there isn't much difference. Expect earlier posts next week. Mostly because my following Monday will be under my control MUAHAHAHA<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>(*Tsuki ga Kirei is having an arc review episode this week like Alice to Zouroku last week, so...)<br /><b>Alice to Zouroku:</b> THIS IS ALL I HAVE WANTED. Thanks, Anime. Can we just have this for the rest of the season? No?<br />This new episode (6) after an arc review (see above, and last week) is just... a slice-of-life Anime. In case you're here for just the action and think this is the next magical girl show or the next major arc of fighting and magic or whatever, it's not. At least, not for this episode. And maybe next week too, seeing the title. So yeah, this might just be it. Slice-of-life, the show that I've always wanted it to be. I mean, you don't know how it feels to watch Episode 1 and hope for the day it'll be like Usagi Drop where we talk about family and life, but hey, we apparently are. The episode lightly plays two days worth of life in the storyline, where Sana-chan joins Zouroku in walking the streets, helping out in his florist shop where possible, and getting accepted into the family. Hey, not very surprising, but he did it. Good on him, old man. But hey, as I mentioned, I like myself some peace and quiet. The problem here is, will it stay on like that? Will a bigger problem emerge considering it took 5 episodes to get Sana-chan to settle down? How long will this peace last? We won't find out next episode though it seems, but maybe soon. I don't know when, but soon.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wRcbeCfrUNE/WSD_P4rEuYI/AAAAAAAAfvA/ZhF3k7LFbKA7IZUY1EOrLkzNlq5yxBTdACLcB/s320/alicezouroku06_bath.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I think I'm officially made a paedophile after this scene lol<br />(The family part, not the... fanservice haha)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Sanae-chan for MVP. Yes, it's not Sana-chan again. The granddaughter (the legit one haha) earns credit for always being cuter than the other. No really. And there's also whatever you'd expect as a granddaughter, lying around the house and going to school and stuff. Damn, Sana-chan needs to get to school so I can change MVPs haha<br />P.P.S. Seeing this episode Sana-chan clearly doesn't have the brains on being a human (I mean, she could've used the salon as point of communication ie. ask to call Zouroku) and as a magical girl (she can't do heating up water because she forgot she can place it down on something like a bucket lol), huh. Well, guess she needs more training. Talking about the latter, she can get Ichijou to be her sensei if she needs some lessons haha that girl's a badass<br /><br /><b>Eromanga-sensei: </b>"Sorry, but I have siscon!" -Izumi Masamune, 2017 (Yeah, you wish he'd said that to Muramasa haha)<br />Hey, this new episode (7) continues on the potential competition between Masamune and the most popular light novel author above him, Muramasa Senjuu. Problem is, because this is a harem show (if it isn't obvious to you yet), we got another person who is in love with him. Not only for his works (because she probably didn't read enough books lol), but the person himself. (I hope she has seen enough guys to know Masamune isn't the best looking guy around lol) Although I have a feeling this is just a one-hit wonder episode where it's focused on Muramasa herself, but in this case there is also a lot on the flashbacks, and a lot on the life stories. The competition is still up, and she thought she could stop the sibling love that is between Masamune and Sagiri. She was wrong. Sagiri stepped up to the occasion (like, literally) to show how much that story matters to the couple to say the least, and it kind of makes of a slightly expected cliffhanger, because someone couldn't stop writing that love letter haha. On the other hand, in view of this going full on harem in the next few episodes, I would say that even so Muramasa (she) will no doubt play a good role in Masamune's (he) life. And as mentioned by the sister who should probably get out of the house soon, she might just go on dates with the most popular guy in town haha. No seriously, this is LITERALLY the definition of a harem Anime, for those who don't know of this term.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x-kxjnOiD4E/WSEGxTG6AvI/AAAAAAAAfvQ/uhgOFM1NUmMZG2OuOEr0YVDmrJLN-WYTACLcB/s320/eromanga-sensei07_muramasa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Cosplay", huh.<br />No, I don't think she's cute. Sorry, Muramasa. No wonder he doesn't care.<br />The sister is a different story though lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Attack on Titan S2:</b> I can see how this is going to get exciting after this part now that we have the main party joining in (okay, no Levi, but still), so this season is going to end strong, I can feel it.<br />This new episode (33) talks about the conclusion, which was whatever happened when the Colossal Titan dropped right on struggling Reiner and Eren in titan form. Turns out Bertolt (I researched on the name haha) was just throwing down his titan form, ready to distract Eren as he gets his limbs bit off by Reiner, before they decide to leave with Eren and Ymir. I won't bore you with the flashback and story afterwards, but suffice it to say many were injured, and waiting for the main party might just be their best option (as I said, no Levi haha). Good thing is, Hannes, who is smarter than those two traitors, knows where they would be headed. As time is of essence, this might just be it. I mean, for this season, to settle things straight. Well if it's a bunch of people fighting the impossible (steam, I mean) we are promised with straight on awesome action in the next few episodes down the line. Here's to hope there's some great ending we can achieve, if not for more people dying for the price of human victory in this arc. But hey, because I've been spoiled by manga somehow, I can't wait to see what happens on the other world with human titans, to be honest. But no, let's not make that happen for now, yes?<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kSmjpWMfeEQ/WSENqkm_8xI/AAAAAAAAfvw/TFhpEmn-77AkEmP9h_R6FhK-hwukmJwjQCLcB/s320/attackontitan33_eat.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Eating combat rations porn lol<br />No really, especially Mikasa haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Okay the next episode seems like a quarrel. Well, we have to finish those boring story heavy episodes somehow haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Dagashi Kashi: </b>The new chapters (59-60) are all about exotic dagashi, it seems. Don't ask me about lingo on these chapters because I didn't understand half of it either. Fancy to know there's a way to fake pasta from instant noodles, I would've done it myself haha. On other things, Hotaru is surprised Kokonotsu asked her a question about dagashi, and Sayashi can cook pasta?!! Sign me up!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0_fyM-peSS4/WSGaybMeWqI/AAAAAAAAfxM/OdA0499er-Y0UJwA7MfydoMWyeUElLmZgCLcB/s320/ddgsks60_03.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="198" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Also, she knows how to strike a pose!<br />Damn, Hotaru-chan is sexy haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is prosperous in Klassic Note, in contrast to last week, as Apple Music is showering me with new songs waiting for me to give them. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/e2/b7/9f/e2b79fda-0d58-bec2-1593-29a963ebab31/source/170x170bb.jpg" />cinema staff's new album</abbr></b> is pretty good I would say, because with ears only (the music videos are weird) I can give half the album up till now. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/eb/ed/f8/ebedf887-f9dc-1019-7fff-760120930c2b/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Sayuri's first album</abbr></b> probably is a disappointment, as her singing is really getting in the way of me giving some of the songs in the list. On the other hand, the melodies aren't that great either. I also chanced upon <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music91/v4/4d/6e/e5/4d6ee575-bbcc-be26-73b2-e6ca37de5bec/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Yogee New Waves' new album</abbr></b> released this week and I must say... I may have missed their style. But maybe not. I've only given one song thus far. Probably giving them more next week.<br /><br />Not talking about next week (yet), I also got a chance to give earlier releases from up to last month. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/ad/9a/8f/ad9a8f13-1919-8324-c29c-32bd5b6a2ad6/source/170x170bb.jpg" />SpecialThanks new album</abbr></b> is also out online somehow, and I guess I can give some of them. Well, I kind of gave quite a lot of them, many of them have music videos online, so be sure to&nbsp;<strike>check those out</strike>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_jWj0Wl8TG-UlSmo4HG3kDtTJYBO4UgB" target="_blank">follow my YouTube playlist</a>&nbsp;to get updated haha. <b><abbr class="imgpop"><img src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/e6/9d/93/e69d93a1-37d4-e204-cc62-b5ca896288da/source/170x170bb.jpg" />Sambomaster's new single</abbr></b> (not the album released last week though) from last month is also okay, but I just can't get myself to give all three songs anyway, so one will do lol<br /><br /><b>Next week brings us a lot of new releases.</b> A lot of new singles, specifically. And I mean a lot. Like, half a dozen of them. Namely (in order of entry to the list of Klassic Note releases) Shinsei Kamatte-chan, TrySail, ORESAMA, toi toy toi, Toyosaki Aki-chan and Touyama Nao. Wow, that's a mouthful. Yes, you may also remember from last month that Kamatte-chan was already given, if not for me not knowing of its real release date haha. Also, all of them are Anime-related theme song releases, in case you wonder what's with the new songs release boom lol I mean I already pre-ordered Aki-chan's single haha<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I need to go to overlays too. What do you think? Does it spur you to go give a listen to? Or do I need to tap into the <a href="https://tools.applemusic.com/" target="_blank">Apple Music Toolbox</a>&nbsp;(I'm not joking it's official stuff) to show you widgets and give you music previews so your curiosity will be drawn out? Haha just joking anyway, there's no way I'll be doing it. I seriously considered about it though. For like, half an afternoon. But no, I'm too lazy already. Also, too busy doing up this blog too. So, no. *laughs*<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
