You get shit on by your parents who know nothing about you- <div><br /></div><div>  I swear this is the last time I'll talk about my pathetic life until the new   packages come in which is NOT pathetic by any means but that also means I'll   have to close the door to my room besides the time I do every night when I   sleep. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Is this how it works? Am I just living in a fever dream now?   *sips decaf coffee* </div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, thank goodness Anime is better than this despite me also finding   stuff that can corelate to my life somehow so let's try not to next season,   yes? Hey, sequels don't count I can't predict the future and I don't read   original works so people like my bro can spoil it to me- You know this season   of Anime "Komi-san" ends on their first year, meaning there's two more years?   Yeah, rather not know about that fact haha... </div><div><br /></div><div>  ENJOYING ANIME AND MUSIC ALONE IS   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">SAIKOU</a>~ lol<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS212">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "It seems like (Shikijou) has caused a number of problems in the past"       YEAH PROF NO SHIT WHY SAY THIS NOW- Uh oh.     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay Yukimura lecture time I have a feeling I'm going to hate this so we shall   see if in this final episode of the second season (#RikeKoiS212) they will   make this end well- Uh... what is with the warning? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay okay just a   slight one I guess looks like it's mostly violence, because things are getting   heated up for the conclusion! Hell yeah, I guess, but remember when Shikijou   tried to confess properly on Kanade and got rejected? Turns out, the final   boss was him, yeah. Likely in a fit of anger, he then shot her with a taser   (how do you even bring such things out? well it's in the public I guess) and   kidnapped her? Okay, I'm still following I guess. But yeah, as the Professor   he works under talks about his eccentric behaviour and I wonder why he isn't   beat up yet, Shikijou here is seeking the ideal romance through much more   normal means I guess without resorting to violence, but who knows what will   happen if that happened much earlier. This kid went to college, by the way,   just so you know, unlike his many buddies who might not have and are really   just here to enjoy some fresh skin lol I really can't make jokes like this at   this point, still may not know how crazy Shikijou might be in person.   Ironically, Kanade can't agree to such a confession even if she was forced to   (And I wish she was forced to- Okay I should stop the jokes here) so I guess   he just beat up his buddy or something. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay, dude, do whatever.   Thank goodness Yukimura is here for the rescue, and he's where the scene of   saving someone becomes very NOT normal because apart from Kanade's predicament   being tied up and such, her senpai still is able to set up a projector against   the wall and explain the definition of "normal" in front of gang members who   did not care and probably just one guy would relate to a smaller extent so   that's funny I guess. Of course, they didn't take much care though to us it's   probably more important as they also let Takahashi-sensei elaborate on what   WOULD have been the best groping incident ever IF Kanade didn't send the   teacher to the ground back then and into the hospital. I don't think that will   scar a person such as Kanade since you know, love is in the air, BUT! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Okay you know where I'm going, so yeah, to achieve that ideal ending maybe   wasn't important after all. How are you going to ask for all the hospital   bills now after all these years, isn't it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, with Yukimura   dragging time, I sure hope he called the police before he stepped in so no   surprises there, he was just playing around with these kids maybe taking a few   hits too so law enforcement can get his back before all his DNA gets punched   out of him. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah... feels great talking about all the stuff without   having to talk about "normal" anymore, isn't it, Kanade-chan? So all in all, I   must say they did the one episode which I have the highest doubts presented in   the best and most scientific way ever, I can't even complain about it. So   shout out to Yukimura for making this great, and guess who got a new admirer   after this event. Well, I say that considering unless Yukimura is going a   two-timer on his current girlfriend, this   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a> over here   can only seduce him as far as we can imagine and then MAYBE Torasuke will go   out with his childhood friend. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah right, I'll just buy a life-sized   plushie of Aika-chan for him or something. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Gotta say though, this   season so far has its ups and downs, I definitely wasn't here for the science   OR the violence, but I guess this is in its best way or even the way to end   this season, in my opinion. That, you get as much respect as Kanade has of   Yukimura, maybe even affection, I don't know. Go take my DNA sample now and   check if there's more love for this series before this seasson started haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; Yeah, it's all the fault of Kanade's grandfather. Yeah. He ruined the   girl's life. Period. Should've beaten him to death. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg924Z3j5zVxY1qUA9LhsieFsW2Gzm_DIS-2kmj2BKfrNQegdSDzDzqaOL154fCK5zz5FC0knOxFj6IeFTodaE_Ifl6FIiwwCBOeCtJkZQGqdl_p9z4PY5voTDSzWeFnV8k_OKA5b07V5xWhUEj_iiAU28oHaFoUjb8Sq3vrA4ZRvIaqs4T3xgOOm9i/s320/rikekoiS212_kanade8.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I'm aroused for some reason haha             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdOF5vKHE_D0jylKKbwVBhnYKgmOLNBHLDD958Ypa51g8fn6W1pVYw4W6ExNKkEh4KJ3plkmXS8CHZoXnQETyzF8QPB_JON2aQAv5WLlx845hj_y5SQ_pDLjW4CzeWWfXurGe8zQIEOg8EHwaRenkxG5D4VynIt_dAyXQ2uh8dAQ-EXLXPWpJ30kOh/s320/rikekoiS212_tied2.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I know this is a kidnapping but goddamn I have a tied up fetish               lmao             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisx7FkTrFqFFCGgtTUh1u2f7jLMaJSFI3VJEdZAY5pHQ4rd_xnzrQymNBgFR_yMFFqK6DLVKfCij6Z3ZVRVLRdujIJ-90GBWvBLGONiZT7k5P-foLyhMKrzrw_q6rhtpCb0dxeEehBVx3JcTK05KpI1XDJWQ9s7XQGOy-Tl31kZ_4w8zYQagRFGac5/s320/rikekoiS212_cry.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Himuro is literally burning her boyfriend's science data archive               right now lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

No   really, the animation team didn't draw anything in last week, it's not just   you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In the final episode where there can't be more violence in an   action series than this and this is not action lol (#AharenSan12) oh... OH!!!   Haha so wait, she thought Aharen-san got rejected by Raidou even though the   guy didn't even say anything in return? Uh oh. UH OH HAHA someone get more   insurance now for Raidou-kun here we might be too late. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, to   conclude the series, I guess we need more misunderstandings from Oshiro here   so guess I'm right, she probably got the wrong idea when her friend was trying   to confess to Raidou and thought she got rejected. Or at least, her feelings   were not returned and I guess Oshiro hates such uncertain feelings? Ah hey,   you tell me. As they show flashbacks when she was the previous victim to   Aharen's school life lol, besides Reina-chan's unbelievable cuteness haha and   Oshiro-san basking in her care as they always do same with Raidou, it kind of   reminds you how these victims (lol) deal with Aharen in different ways. In his   case, however, we then found out that in that mystical scene a couple of weeks   ago it looks like the reverse happened, so technically Raidou did tell the   girl he liked her, unlike what Oshiro has thought of by herself. Surprise   surprise, everyone was around when these two are having a duel of Reversi lol   you can't make a heart in that game, and yes I am including Tobaru-sensei in   this mix. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Kind of feels weird from that confession from both sides,   but I can't think of a better ending so I'll take that. And then I assume the   flowers thing with the tea party is just filler so we can get everyone   together and see how long Tobaru-sensei can last not talking about the couple.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, I think I gotta spend more time to talk about how much   this series actually lived up to its name being a romance comedy series! OH MY   GOD IT'S SO GOOD!!! No really, if I ranted about this it's only for how lame   the jokes were, but goddamn if you were Raidou and/or Reina-chan here every   moment will be a joke to me because I'm single and these two just got closer   than ever. Yes, it's the ultimate appreciation of the beauty of this situation   that the sensei is bleeding out about. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, think back about   it, they may have set up to talk about Aharen-san being weird and all, so this   actually is a new setup for what seems to be a blooming romance in progress,   and everyone is there to make sure you don't get what's up until it's coming.   To that, I hardly see romance comedy do it this subtle these years already   it's either full-on drag or just waiting to be disappointed, but THIS.   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah, am I satisfied with this series? You bet I did! I will just   go back and watch the special ending and Aharen-san doing rapping again or   even witness that censored confession from Raidou lol, but hey, there were so   much to remember, is the point. I just hope whatever they drop on us with new   characters is a super big hint for another season of Anime because I don't   even mind having more of these lame jokes packaged into a romance story you   would want to watch before you die. Looking at you Momo-chan haha excuse me   while I clap until my hands hurt </div><div>  [TL:DR; I'm just surprised Raidou's catchphrase isn't "What are you doing?" or   anything close to that so he doesn't have to imagine things.

She working overtime now. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, amongst all the chaos we have   witnessed this week, let's see how far we have come in this school festival,   and where the drop will be at because really, things can't go THIS smoothly or   can it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Firstly, we have some phantom thief dropping all the hints on   the students and stealing balloons it seems, so looks like there is someone   stealing stuff in the festival enough to make a fuss but not enough for the   student council or the organizing committee to care. Why though? Because they   are busy confessing to each other and/or rejecting each other somehow, don't   ask me why, ask Tsubame there. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Or maybe they are already together   like the senpai who has (or all people, and I can't believe I'm mentioning   this again) Osaragi as his girl already so <span title="*shrugs*">🤷</span> Anyways haha, Shirogane   had to tend to his class doing balloon art, so guess who dropped by wanting a   heart-shaped balloon. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Shout out to Nagisa-chan doing the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/AD" target="_blank">AD role</a> by speeding   up the rolling of tapes here so we can get to the best part of this scene as   soon as possible lol yeah Kaguya can't progress for sh*t like poor Maki-chan   over there, because if not we will never see Kaguya wanting to get a heart...   in exchange for a heart haha wow this one got me good I like how they had to   trade instead of paying lmao she just signed that damn contract without   reading the fine text huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then again, why bother to anyways? Because   really, if the fortune-telling was right and I rather just think that senpai   is reading off some script since why not, is that even if you signed that   contract that is called marriage we will have a great husband-wife   relationship in front of the bed and at the back of the bed too- Can we not   slip in Anime "Seitokai Yakuindomo" references in here? This is a safe, holy   space, please? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as the... let's just take it as couple lol they   will be once we're done with this season lmao, the couple take their rounds   around the school because what's wrong with the Student Council President   walking down the alleys with the Vice President lol <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, somehow all bad   stuff has averted her way from Ishigami's depression and I sure hope that has   a decent conclusion I feel really bad for Ishigami I don't want to be anyone   who has to console him because he got dumped lmao, Fujiwara is just being   detective so has no time for Kaguya anyways, Miko-chan is hungry so the eating   contest will keep her in better than those guys who want to land their hands   on her do and goddamn were they close (Did we talk about how easy was Iino-san   as a woman, by the way? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>) (No really, the fortune-teller told me   about it, a true master in bed <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>), just... not all of them averted. For   yes this was what I expected for the final episode, Shirogane dropped the bomb   on Kaguya here with his acceptance letter to the overseas university. So yeah,   as he said, this will be his final year, being a second year high school   student. Oops, should've mentioned that earlier. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, great   build up to the final episode which will be AN HOUR LONG by the way in case   you haven't seen the news out there I am always 2 days late so don't mind me   lol, and I can't wait for the phantom thief of balloons to be arrested.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay serious talk though, what are the chances that is just Shirogane   himself setting up for the confession to his girl? What are the chances- Also   the narrator is seriously quiet this week I wanted him to rebut against Kaguya   during the walk with Prez but he didn't. Hmm... haha I guess we will know the   truth by next week. You know, whether Kaguya is great in bed- Haha bye </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEie1MteJpYQBJufmt8e1WWK49gNO3bGaOyqxzAtVolMMpvGkIwf5wD8c7ORW489vFChcDEq3C-cWzyR8qv9Dbh6Xnz074_ATB2hhGYDzkKehppcxhf8ctglwWYmm3DAFL1fYoZ2iyiMM3Q0fisVPA7DXH4DmPH4pqe9KKeDfTlHP8OlGOBSRdnPI25L/s320/kaguyasamaS311_couple3.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              These are so real I can't even<br />(They have come so far <span title="*sob*">😢</span>)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEig647Jo_FBRA05yQlvxN4FuxmFX51s4rmWyOjWFwL5glaPA_FauoDqgtXkV3sterIQiXFSZ0TPAQ7S5vAkUPZKg6DHcyzbGg0NLi1W3wTr0ClM5YLLuqJYbWC3MFV9vI8UizezYdi-EbThAF1lULDaVfaYAP9bvaHx7g207oIGkXZMDS1aXjqa2gLq/s320/kaguyasamaS311_couple2.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              These are so real I can't even<br />(Damn)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiL9SaGHsQHMQnGEsWRHIvIvJjCp6SWbFZOcALkhIVObL2CmPHJovVXZmGTREXeYJ_d-TjEdZwVwCiab5vDBKM90RBuCLxrXM5lfBmAE7JBpPlgoxFm75P8x468jcXtZhilVle7c5tOoRK8_6IMSf_weE6oKmVyFpYryfKDPh7zBqRbKWH2-xm13OHf/s320/kaguyasamaS311_news2.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              These are so real I can't even<br />(Haha love news               sensualisation)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Oh yeah this is a thing in Japan, by the way     </div>  </blockquote>  Oh yeah, the day after Valentine's Day. I wonder how the reactions of the   other girls besides Komi-san are... You think Yamai-san has a problem going to   school? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey I can make fun of Komi-san all I can if she doesn't   appear in school in this new episode (#KomiSan23) just because but you know   she gotta go or else her perfect attendance will be ruined lol does anyone   give a damn about those though? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, meeting Tadano is always a   joy so might as well go hehe, I don't think much happened even if Komi-san DID   go to school. Just, you know, you just gave chocolates to the guy who sat on   your left. Friendly chocolates, by the way. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Okay moving on, we got   more to talk about apparently they still dishing in new characters in the   second last episode of this season. Should... should I even talk about   Yamai-san and her spotting Komi-san in her torn stockings? I mean,   <a href="https://twitter.com/y_o_m_y_o_m" target="_blank">Yomu-sensei</a> will   be screaming right now if not for the girl running down the alley with them   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/namaashi" target="_blank">bare legs</a> as   we all wished for, chasing down that freak with the stockings in her head lol   well at least she won't get found out right? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I can't even <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I   already knew it's a problem when she suggested changing out her stockings for   her she's gonna keep the old torn one I just didn't expect her to wear it on   her head- MOVING ON haha we really need to talk about normal stuff. Like   hot-tempered Onigashima-san (also read as "demon island" lol) who can't stop a   moment to be pissed at everything in life though it looks more like she is not   great at most things kinda like the opposite of jack of all trades lol, as she   tries her best to not get angry before she reaches the school gate and flips   when she missed her third traffic light. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, there's no helping   this girl... or is there? Well, someone to support her will be the easiest way   out, but seeing that Yamai being her childhood friend is also scared of her   mental state, really makes you wonder whether you can pull it off like my bro   who thinks that patting her head will appease her- Maybe getting hit by her   baseball bat will make her better. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then we have Satou-san. Amami   might be better of a name to refer to for her personality, as she is born to   be nice to others. So "Yes-Man" but it's Anime and it's a girl who you can ask   her grandmother's panties from. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We'll talk about that MILF perv later   lol but long story short, she doesn't know how to say no as seen from her   super kind nature. Probably not a good idea as suggested by her friend (who   sits   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ushiro" target="_blank">behind</a> Komi-san   in class and don't ask about her name pls) because one can easily take   advantage of you and I'm not saying that because you're a woman. No really,   it's a bad idea. And thanks to Tadano, it's also she never asked for anything   in return, which sounds like a problem in itself since she doesn't learn to   appreciate the joy of returning of favours. Should've asked for a nickel every   time she cleans up everyone's desk. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, pretty sure you don't   have much time to play   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shougi" target="_blank">shougi</a> and   quarrel at this time considering next week will be the final episode of this   long series we didn't ask so much of but now we want double this amount haha,   I'm personally more into Satou-san of the two new girls because I can ask for   help more because I don't, and Komi-san is ALWAYS RIGHT, Tadano. ALWAYS. Haha   I wonder what is for dinner maybe protein shake with a straw for   Onigashima-san so she doesn't spill on herself lmao </div><div>  [TL:DR; Yeah really appreciate the mentions of the people to the right, front   and back of Komi-san. Shouldn't have talked to them though, I understand.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1080"                 data-original-width="1920"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWBOgFxdwzSKRD0QAYH2s-A1F2g_uDfcbL1iDt3yohO5YPl-c_XtULRtwS-ZBO7Q1suZsnnCNXubc_CXNRLraWmbj2V9xsE792W9Aw2DXck52HO_4G-jRz_zSSdArh1SGjztsQPyJfeEi2z-X3q2ygPb2XpBctT9Oc76n8S0u9ZCwrB3mfBdKpHngm/s320/komisan23_yamai3.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This is just so wrong I can't even believe you Yamai-san<br />(She's               just twisting on the ground lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1080"                 data-original-width="1920"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqhT-Zv6NFbr2liYl8eXm1SXetCB7QP3qLQyGIHPXb1NKZMeXu2o76DmPOUnp9FVojj9PXQ9TsMi7Uz_rf4RDPmLoR3rQrJky0woYZ7FDw61b94qV3E6tX6Dt0rrz9vVG98p8WqDcfLxjprtGdvhh4RrNadMthbQGRQiv1ruPfTbHUQ25ZWbwueCNQ/s320/komisan23_yamai4.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This is just so wrong I can't even believe you Yamai-san<br />(If               I didn't tell you anything you might think this is some old perv)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1080"                 data-original-width="1920"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB-xiTizoyRIqhLLH7TWn0kt7lg7jzvaDxOmrxcxUCqTCZWeZzRqSc6lmrJcI5-7I4FoCnvlBWT-P3IAFJVymY4_oZzSe5-FzCGD9T9YlhtJEJzAurwX8wsTjso9Wsw6dJ22STcMHHrcigzJQlXzZtIWa7gyDrjUJvbp8qGu-dFOIYOemVqweNCkhK/s320/komisan23_yamai5.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This is just so wrong I can't even believe you Yamai-san<br />(WTF               haha)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

This time, it's a   guy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah that sounds like a good joke and it still is, but I think   many may have the feels too it's not just Shikimori, but maybe because Inuzuka   has such a resemblance to the brother (voiced by the one and only   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/356/Hiro_Shimono" target="_blank"     >Shimono Hiro</a   >  who himself is also cool btw he was just&nbsp;<a     href="https://myanimelist.net/character/14775/Jin_Mikuriya"     target="_blank"     >main character</a   >  in   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/character/2279/Ikuto_Touhouin"     target="_blank"     >half the Anime</a   >  I watched as a kid haha) that maybe, just maybe, someone is putting this   boyfriend's friend two and two together with how she treats her brother, so   coldly. Maybe that's why she has been putting her distance from him, seeing   that j-j-j-jealousy happen between what was just the boyfriend's childhood   friend so maybe Izumi should depend on her cool girlfriend more just saying   haha, and how Hachimitsu is so spot on we need her as the new generation Anime   detective Fujiwara from "Kaguya-sama" is getting old we need new blood.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, probably a combination of those since Shikimori isn't   denying it anyways, but at least it's not so much hate and misunderstanding we   have to fight over it lol. Honestly saying though, these character exclusion   scenes are actually great for different types of bonding we have so far, and   now that the guys are missing along with MVP Hachimitsu lol, the girls hang   out with Kamiya for some reason. Yeah, they spotted her in the mall and asked   her to join in. Surprisingly, these two ex-love rivals were nice to each   other, getting each other gifts from the arcade, Nekozaki doesn't even know   this is a trash fire or a trash fire which got dumped into the ocean. Hey, you   tell me, author. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> What is clear though is that Kamiya isn't like   herself in school as many in school would've shunned her compared to Nekozaki   herself who is always nice enough to ask her to hang out even though it ends   up in a rejection- WHY IS THIS ANIME TALKING ABOUT ME? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (I apologize   to my bro for asking me out every time and I just say no because I rather do   this blog post lol) But seriously though, if being herself is playing arcade   games and basketball with Shikimori and winning, it's no wonder I have to hang   out with my friends more- Nope. Nope. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, pretty obvious who was   the one that changed her thinking to be more like herself instead of putting   on a farce in front of schoolmates, and maybe at that point, just maybe,   Nekozaki will know more about the stuff happening between Kamiya and the   person who changed her - Izumi. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, Shikimori has done more   to herself than others to prove that she is not just cute and it's not wrong,   she is making waves on the people around her who fear for her jealousy (lol)   or just want to see her more pissed just because of the guy she likes. And I   cannot be more envious than ever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, can't feel for this if I'm   not in it, amirite?? Haha someday I will... someday <span title="*sob*">😢</span> </div>[TL:DR; You would think putting this girl Hachimitsu into this series is a mistake.

And yes I double-checked they will be   NO competition against this fantastic band where I hope to be disappointed at   release (lol) and THEN pick up the pace and talk about how great they are at   their next livestream, if any. Hey, I gave them 2 years ago in a livestream; I   will do it again.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  And goddamn is Koko-chan's photobook releasing next week. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah hey, I   should be glad, me, that I didn't get a signed copy of the book so I can wait   for another month for goodness also lest the Internet spoil it for me, but we   all know this is going to be disappointing anyways considering we just saw TWO   photobooks which showed more skin than our dear Kohara Konomi will show EVER.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So much for 30 years old, huh. Speaking of which, what should my   30-year-old plan be? Happening soon, by the way. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Cya guys next time   then, and until next time... I think I'll sleep with some Scenarioart music so   I can be happy and look forward to their album next week. More of the latter   because who is happy living in this world anyways lol please don't die and   come back to read this next week would you, me?
