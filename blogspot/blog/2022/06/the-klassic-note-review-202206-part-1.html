I don't even know how long, I'm   doing a TWO-PART monthly review?? WHAT MADNESS IS THIS </div><div><br /></div><div>  So yeah, introducing to you the Suzuki Productions Package -Powered by Mizuno   Yoshiki- (See what I did there? Radio show fans will know)&nbsp;for Anime   "Kaguya-sama" season 3!! Can't be more elaborate than that haha but yes this   was segregated from the other batch of REAL releases for this specific reason   lol, also because of special gifts to be honest, so we will talk about all of   that in a moment. </div><div><br /></div><div>  But first, let's talk about why two single-track singles will appear in   Klassic Note Review!! Ah, did I just put the answer in the question? Oops haha </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span       class="head-prefix"       ><b>音楽</b></span     ><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Suzuki Masayuki - GIRI GIRI feat.

So if you don't know of dear Suzuki Masayuki right here no one will blame you   for it; Your dad if he's Japanese probably knew him better than you do.   Besides singing funky songs as his usual style over the years, about 5 years   ago he has been brought in my Anime producers to sing the opening theme for   Anime "Kaguya-sama" and launched him into unprecedented territory where now he   has the power to attract you and your mom at the same time! Ironically perfect   for the budget, the third time around brings his release into a single unlike   previous releases for the Anime, which is why I get to talk about it. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) GIRI GIRI feat. Suu [Just Barely]</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">"Just barely let (us) love each other</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Burn those lies away, let it be dreams</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">(I'm) not joking, let's dance more</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Damn (I) can't take it anymore, let's confess (our) love, love, love"   </div></blockquote><div></div><div></div><div>  This song and every opening theme song Suzuki-san has sung for this series has   been on point, from its unexpected funky style to the lyrics mocking about the   romance between the main characters because spoiler alert we are three seasons   in and it's "just barely" as hinted by the song title, we are welcome with   another great melody that will sing to you as you remember this series. It's   not going to surprise anyone the third time coming, but with another guest   vocalist to add to the mix, this time welcoming in SILENT SIREN's vocalist Suu   whom you might know, is here to deliver the lighter portion of the vocal   scale. The lyrics of course hint about being ace student, a bit of teasing   here and there, and how much love wants to exist in between. And this will   never get old, in my opinion. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vptdHEUZN10"     title="YouTube video player"   ></iframe></div><div>Rating: Just Barely Average</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: This will be a classic to remember, you heard it first. Whether   you should bring your parents or even grandparents to like this too is up to   you, but I'm sure with the backing of Anime, we all will remember how close we   have come to giving one of the oldest music artists you might have listened to   at one point. I'm not saying this is bad, but it will be an experience to live   with. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span       class="head-prefix"       ><b>音楽</b></span     ><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">Suzuki Airi - Heart wo Oteage [Single]</div></blockquote><table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="341"           data-original-width="378"           height="289"           src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizT202xeJVmi0tpcdCrbHS5orHB_Gn3SLWc1Wi8wLxfP941XGum6kU8Y0-f07UMlGUhXGHzsmYKtg0eXo_4zqIwKsbAnnF36FmSyVvsnB_8dxwf5gth2mZRCB5_mMe-ByukhCcsCRhQvhllw8GjUaN9rGGwSQ1mHNbLD8Dpw5bxrgSpYyHiRekMmxF/s320/6284c5bfda531%5B1%5D.jpg"           width="320"         />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="500"           data-original-width="500"           height="320"           src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil4Ny6lD2trgN1_eNbnv-u9kgfQIi1sbOerD0onfI_xV1q2iH-BLlGZPgS8frvLanlqwfW974bKvt7tabJfRbx2MJI3apRyrDVaHQR3uPP-ZiOTwLBeJvINowYnZBrRYATRhRLgzkmHUoX_2U2qErQeJuwoLxoA2VTHxRFTXP7ONrynK0hSWHxsHJO/s320/625fb58a224a6%5B1%5D.jpg"           width="320"         />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>(Yes, artist cover, don't ask more questions)</div><div><br /></div><div>  Origin: For having to be guest vocal in a former Suzuki Masayuki song for the   Anime's season 2, this former idol group member has come a long way for her   solo music career, and this single marks her major debut! That of course   sounds easy considering this is also her first Anime credit, which makes only   her exposure to a larger audience greater than ever, among the other things   about this attractive woman with a great singing voice, I can believe this is   one of many releases that will put her under the spotlight. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Heart wo Oteage [Giving Up (My) Heart]</div><div>From the chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Can't put into words about the clumsy you   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    (I) shall embrace everything, jumping over the borders, (I) can't stop     anymore   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Giving up (My) heart"</div></blockquote><div></div><div></div><div>  We are quickly presented with a simple yet catchy melody of a romance song,   you cannot get better than this quality of music. Saying that though, it does   still suffer from the usual long bridge part issues which I will not   elaborate, but the verses and chorus will make sure you remember this song at   length, one will never complain how good this just sounds. With the slight   slurs and her powerful voice, Suzuki Airi here is quick to deliver great   singing to this nice song. The lyrics of course touch more on the Anime   itself, but also describe looking from the back of ones you love, being   speechless with plenty of affection, this only says a lot more about what this   love song is, devoting one's heart to another. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSuselwRqcE"     title="YouTube video player"   ></iframe></div><div>Rating: Lovingly Average</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: I feel like this is a great exposure to this idol singer, so don't   get me wrong when I say I'm more attracted to her singing than to her in her   image. For music is presented at its best without image, this just makes it   more than appealing to give after the wonderful melody and lyrics which are on   point. This package just overall feels like such a treat, fans of the Anime   series cannot take a miss on this treasure. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>-Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  (Yeah, been complimenting too much on this already, so if you're not ready to   take criticism about these look away now - I feel like I'm back in the 80s   where these songs WOULD exist. Haha thanks Mizuno-san, appreciate the time   travel pills you gave me- We are in 2022, dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>) </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img     border="0"     data-original-height="3024"     data-original-width="4032"     height="240"     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisf25_FAIejK3bwgLCsxaRnj7E91Vk1DnTJRVq6s30RiYkxVPac6Qi-ojQi2WJmzid1deXD1VjCL2HEmmNUtEVAXVf5-2uSpG6UsN2T7BmTxPDzvDM9htGlWlCpzh7RYaWuqkMqIcJuTzc4VvPBe3lH-YTA_GnvPkBBg1epMqWRUYme7QZzB52B9sY/s320/PXL_20220615_114412626.jpg"     width="320"   /></div><div>  I mean, even from the covers one would have already believed that one of these   would be different in packaging from the other, right?

Yeah, I   was too late for this apparently lol so I'm not risking it and also this is   why they aren't with the upcoming package which is also good news because I   don't think I can do FIVE singles in one night haha ah </div><table   align="center"   cellpadding="3"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="2955"           data-original-width="3940"           height="240"           src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEt7dZV-sqSshDcUp2tmER-fU0yfp4l1CyFeuoOm3HQ1kjC1lWr6vN1Jn2O70nEArCMWdsv5oLsybz3DLsnXpXDqxft4t6Oocw8pJkriNRM87_QhP-zLSnESMEsvXuprI657MSipiuP1vS_uxKmOSIHPqksfjsgK-5e3sgLXz43avIIL_wdEaj846w/s320/PXL_20220615_114606943.jpg"           width="320"         />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="3024"           data-original-width="4032"           height="240"           src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhM6rH9ETk21XJL8dcBAVCNTmqySQIWjCZ7t-zGHuZUSoQJx85AyYtAXtm8zbgv7mtwtBGuViG1876mq-P-7e8hztwYfDHwFvqddtgMe_XIGzN0BE6w93apzEBbnc4AifPKD0igeGGg_ksYhvPQv0yyZktjKGuGsjCdEWK8O3gcFpQegdqVKhXG-bIO/s320/PXL_20220615_115437556.jpg"           width="320"         />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>  About the Suzuki's single though lmao Airi-chan that is, apart from the hard   cover wrapping in the CD, we are also presented with a special gift random   bromide photo (yep, she's an idol alright) with every purchase which are   adapted from the music video filming if you watch it yourself there were three   outfits, and... I swear I got the worst haha any one of the other would have   been better and I don't even want the rare one. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (What they ca those,   hair buns?
