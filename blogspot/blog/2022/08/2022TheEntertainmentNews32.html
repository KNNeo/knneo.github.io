Trust me, I want to write a blog post in the middle of the night haha I just didn't because it was so good I was just thinking about it until I slept again haha <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> <div><br /></div><div>  Okay dreams aside happy birthday Oonishi Saori you are my best girlfriend   candidate for the foreseeable future haha and I guess also Naganawa Maria man   this is unless you can be my slave and always sound like a beautiful masochist   under my- Oh more bromides from her birthday event with Ede-chan memo memo   haha a lot of money burnt this month already but thanks to my dad not claiming   free government money which I did in his place... <span title="*wink*">😉</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, let's Anime and music this long weekend! Remember what I said about   shortening these intros? Haha also because I don't want to list more people I   know who are infected with the C-virus as I would like to call it watching   some Resident Evil gameplay just now lmao hey someone definitely predicted   this pandemic I tell ya<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKari18">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "As expected, giving a hottie that boomer gift wasn't good" Haha Kazuya       you tell me     </div>  </blockquote>  She got your gift already, bro, stop staring up from underneath your   neighbour's porch- In this new episode where remember we had to add in renting   Sumi-chan for the birthday gift costs haha (#KanoKari18), I guess hey as a   neighbour one could ask if she liked the birthday gift, right? Hey, just heard   that your birthday was around and decided on this, nothing else. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Also,   Kazuya be better at picking gifts than me, that's for sure. So yeah, good on   you bro, for this at least. Kazuya talked about renting again, but Chizuru is   literally out with her friends on his only day off so welp. What is not welp   though is him reluctantly agreeing to go with his own friends to drink,   because guess what, how does it happen that your girlfriend that you lied to   your friends is also having the same birthday and also called Chizuru?   Hmmmmmm..... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah if you would recall he lied to Kibe-san and then   took away the girl that the other friend Kuri liked ie. Ruka-chan, I totally   forgot about this. Literally getting backlashed for season one right now haha   hey as you can see Kazuya has a complicated love life. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What's also   complicated is the situation these guys are in, because apart from the others   who don't mind getting slushed since not like any of them are going out with   each other, Kazuya decided to drink himself up with alcohol losing in games to   the others so that we don't have to witness what happens to Chizuru under the   influence of alcohol. But true though, she too precious, really must protect.   Here, drink this plum juice. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And unlike the last time where we had to   deal with the ex in this group of people, at least this is just straight up a   drunk session (get it?) though we still had the beach content because someone   got shook up on her rack lmao can I even say that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And guess who had   to carry Kazuya home this time around haha poor dude doing so much for this   girl she doesn't even know. All in all though, great episode all around, I was   really expecting some action for a next episode preview but I guess this is   beer not turtle curry rice lmao <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> (re-use them jokes) so we not getting   any boners going anytime soon. Mostly just pity and I wouldn't even do this   much for a girl as much as I haven't even tried so... yeah Kazuya is something   of a man here. Well, he won't be after next week considering he had to work   with his actual girl and the ex is appearing to stir up some stuff we don't   know of, which hopefully will still be better than whatever Kazuya puked into   his toilet bowl that night haha see you then </div><div>  [TL:DR; "So I should at least look out for Ichinose, even if it kills me."   This. God, just let me know any idol I like on a personal level. Preferably   Isobe Karin since she liked my Insta comments of her posts lol I am so   pathetic] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj28siPT72Xg5EZBUouteJz8mIUg7NxmB8Q_LM66zecPfTH3Kro0_xD5GwxxZ50IqkqMdrdBn1WPwVYqqpCHznw0bz7gz1Lz7C4vJxkpfJ9mnNmxEzQX5_xFSS6L1JHWXsKmAnQC0SxdpAPh0BT9YfYoayY41gCJuhsg_fZ3IVlXdddOxNUhv6edT9O/s320/kanokari18_couple2.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Expectation or reality?

"Your dick feels the best to you, and thus it's the finest dick." This   series knows I needed new quotes lmao "For some people, their right hand is   their partner" Okay Kibe-san we might have this for the rest of our lives now   lol "I should rethink my friendship with this guy" I KNOW RIGHT haha </div><div>  P.S. "I'm asking if she is good (in bed)" Well Kazuya has only slept with   Ruka-chan so can we talk about her instead? lmao Kazuya you piece of shit-   Also screw you all dude he might just end up going home and be friends with   his right hand- </div><div>  ["That's a pole" is the funniest joke I laughed at this episode lmao yeah   drunk people ladies and gentlemen] </div><div>  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TsureKano05">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Mamahaha no Tsurego ga Motokano Datta</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "... I had what you might call a girlfriend" Dude, it's either yes or no,       don't blur the line here haha Yume-chan said yes so it counts <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     </div>  </blockquote>  Oh, what a surprise, them stepsiblings were neighbours beforehand. I mean,   that's how the parents got along and eventually got attached to each other,   eh? Maybe you two kids should also- In this new episode where we dig more of   the memories I guess haha (#TsureKano05), looks like we are focusing a little   more on the parents. Well, not just specifically, but looks like Mother's Day   is around the corner, so Yume-chan thought it'll be a good idea to show   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/212377/Yuni_Irido" target="_blank"     >Kayanon</a   >  what it looks like to love your mom- Okay me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But of course, as   typical of Mizuto, he rather stay at home and read was that "<a     href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru"     target="_blank"     >TanMoshi</a   >"?? Haha we shall talk about the slew of references later I only know of the   Anime adaptation season two announced by the way, because joke is that in   order to get both of them to go out and buy something together all it takes is   just for Mizuto to ogle on his sister changing out to I probably jerked off to   that outfit already with that rack lol, and then punish him by going along   with the girl anyways so... I guess that is how it works now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, the mother got a bouquet of carnations to boast to the husband so I   hope you guys still have the budget for Father's Day. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on,   Mizuto is suggesting more ideas on how to keep the newlyweds (not them, by the   way) together alone but them kids are in the way. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Not like they have   the budget to send them on a trip or something so they are sending themselves   out on a trip to the love hotel apparently that's where they won't check high   schooler IDs. DEFINITELY a fantastic solution haha Yume-chan agrees lol how   wrong is this line of thought? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, obvious second solution is to   stay over at their friends' place, and because we know of Kawanami and   Minami-san it's not that hard to just put the guy to be with Minami-san and-   Wait. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But you get it, because ironically it's not really a problem   especially worrying about Minami-san's... uh, rather aggressive approaches to   befriending other girls lol, since these secondary characters are also, guess   what, staying near each other and technically under one roof because   apartments. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What is near too is their rooms because goddamn is that   wall in between them just invisible so Kawanami got what he deserved for   talking about Yume-chan's rack out loud since he practically forgot his whole   room is under threat to his friend here Mizuto who will spout all of his   secrets like there's no tomorrow. Comedy everybody! Haha I guess if this is   the type of drama you like this is one of the many dozens of them you can   watch. I'm just here for the ride haha speaking of for the ride, hey Kawanami   you may want to not ride through your exams this time around and actually   study in case you get dropped out for your bad grades lol someone here is   trying to catch up to his genius try-hard sister though. And as the main two   stare at the moon on the balconies of someone else's place in this quiet   night... Yeah, guess they are stuck as stepsiblings till the end of time now.   <span title="*wink*">😉</span> All in all though, as you can see the drama is riveting as it is   concerning, bringing back in relation to the main couple we have here. Well,   main not couple they can't be together anymore. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I mean, they can be,   just, as siblings. Anyways haha, again if you live for this level of drama   you're welcome, I don't really mind anyways especially if you watch the   sh*tshow that is "OsaMake" haha I'm just here for the fanservice I see once in   a while so I'm good. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't expect too much lore though, for what is   this series' appeal is literally all of them talking about their past even if   Mizuto's mom to him is just a photo. See you for more of such talk then </div><div>  [TL:DR; "I wonder if there's any meaning in the time spent together" This   series in a nutshell] </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC57fYQAwiB8dCcZeydCLHosrvRFI-sV7e4sWXmxs1la8knqtSeiWBVktDimDvvRz1vWEeug77FaI2Aj0jEQbeI-YG-g54WY9xNXn57KEXionp3vxw8RM51DMOIbPp-85UrpVvwfVYHRH2pIjC6Dv_MXn7hfFLvRMvLiA-IpMi4aXtBtKSKI2XCwcU/s320/tsurekano05_couple1.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Like seriously, must they make this couple...           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxeLhAYNEH_NdgG8pw5F79MUKj2y0L7Attkxzln9r4McgymzduLf40kvoB1AMRSqEpXWpg1wR1-8En95CEg7g2CeUSJ8RYgRuW-0R4v3PGssdwfRrlrDvxscTOPwF10DP3JC3fxSw_w9-XK9O7r5XWXDw6QaICDXURohX5wm2I-_B2szj8txH2uxJr/s320/tsurekano05_couple2.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            ... behave EXACTLY like this one?

Well   you can, with Aruso- Aursuno- Okay whatever in this new episode where Alberta   still makes better jokes then the younger students in school haha (#Arusuno05)   I guess it's their day off. I mean, every day looks like a day off in this   school somehow. Heck, Hogwarts seems more busy than this bunch of girls who   learn magic but what do we know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The five of them had a blast the   night before going to magical flower botany class, but ended up with very   different days in front of them as you know, no lessons but that doesn't mean   no homework. And that's what Abra-san and Pica-chan were doing so far, so we   already know who are the good girls in class. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Mell-chan and Al-chan   woke up late for breakfast why is their breakfast so damn good especially with   the cheese haha, instead decided to not do homework but go play hide and seek   with a bunch of juniors which I guess they won since they never got found out   but who knows without a time limit set for such an event they can still catch   you when you sleep at night lmao, still did not have a better day than   Tori-chan which I guess we should talk about more this time around. So, about   the Lemegeton sisters. I don't know if this is supposed to be legend or   something because if so we are literally watching the stuff after the action   which goddamn why do we have to deal with flashbacks again, everyone knows   about the five sisters who I guess saved the world? Well they have a statue in   school in their name so I assume it's important. And as we are introduced to   Tori-chan's sister Paulina who resides in the library seeking out the truth   about their sisters and family, somehow only know as much as who they are   in... I wouldn't even say "person" since I don't even know how to describe   Paulina here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But looks like they have some knowledge even about the   research we have been seeing on the night lessons in the previous episode,   since they are also the ones who have stepped outside the school into   fictional London with everything human-like out there, so maybe there is   something else in here that is not magical and that will reveal upon us   someday, I'm not sure about that. What we are sure of is Tori-chan's late   awakening on this off day so she missed breakfast (man, I wish premises like   this can serve free breakfast as late as 11am similar to fast food haha heck,   even hotels don't serve after 10am, been there done that) and had to buy her   own breakfast out of mana which is their own money, then thought of hanging   out with her sister above the books, how sweet. This did entice Mell-chan and   the others to have a picnic the next day which is another day off apparently,   so yeah can't wait for this series to be just days off from now on. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   All in all... Can we only recommend food that is INSIDE the Starbucks menu? We   don't have cheese in pancakesh I guess I have cheese at home but <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I   guess sandwiches are fine but surprise ones? I mean, I would tell my mom to   make some but she can only make sunny side up and ham so *shrugs* Anyways,   great episode, and as I say every week, I miss giving a fantasy slice-of-life   or even just fantasy itself, so I'm taking all this in as I watch every   episode, including Alberta's jokes. Sorry, ko-Alberta's haha her sister can't   make jokes lmao maybe she does we don't know for sure let's find out next time </div><div>  [TL:DR; "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukima" target="_blank">Gaps</a>.

In this new episode where I guess we can't go   solo anymore this is not a horror series anyways lol (#LycoReco06), oh we   living in a safehouse? So this is like Grand Theft Auto? Nice! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I   guess we are in the enemy's call court this time around, where we find out   more about both sides ie. Lycoris and these bad guys, and see how bad guy   Majima try to not kill Robota while we're at it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, story goes   that we find out some history. I like how they link Lycoris to ancient   assassin organizations like some other video game series *ahem* Assassin's   Creed, and the bad guys just want to get rid of the DA which I still assume is   a small part of the Lycoris organization but let's just say it's the most   important because you know, secret. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> What's not so secret now though   is Kurumi's role in the heist in the first episode of the series as she has to   explain herself in her action that caused everything to happen so far, because   I swear if this was two episodes ago this Walnut hacker would have seen   bullets through her actual head. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, she did find out more stuff   that is way more important in saving their a**es unlike those girls who have   died for the cause lol the DA does not even care, is that the bad guys got   hold of faces responsible for the opposition to that very heist. So basically   the four girls who were dead by car accident because Majima made it so easy   compared to how I hit people in GTA so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, taking their phones   and passing it to Robota is their objective as they search for the DA's   physical location which of course, is not as easy even with finding someone's   IP address but I'm not going to describe public networks like that fat dude   who we thought can promise a route into hacking the DA itself. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, Robota did not get close because everyone knew Walnut is the MVP in   the hacking world who isn't dead btw she's just a cute girl I guess being held   hostage now in the café lmao, while the girls have to stay in pair at least   with each other until this incident is over. Or so we think. Maybe it's just   boyfriend Takina (lol) who got enough of the bullsh*t of Chisato who cheats in   scissors paper stone and no wonder she was eager to agree on that instead of a   fixed chores schedule, but thanks to Mika and Mizuki who told her how it works   I guess someone else has to do the cleaning now. Speaking of cleaning, and   that's why Chisato's abode is basically empty on the ground floor as the   basement is her actual living quarters while leaving an empty shell so that   invaders once they pass the door will be greeted by fake bullets and get   thrown out of the windows. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, should've added a sniper into the   squad. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And along with Kurumi's hacking she found out that Chisato was   also on the list of recognized faces, so maybe this will take a while to   conclude since the bad guy can't even die from an explosion lol. It was still   quite a fight to get the girl back though, as much as they should've warned   her to not leave the place alone despite having a poncho of all things to   disguise her school uniform outfit AND use it as a cover if suddenly assaulted   by, wink wink, a bunch of people who are out to kill her. *taps brain* 100IQ   plays right there, I'll give you that. All in all, that's not how rocket   launchers work haha I refer you to science shows like   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5elJNyLVEQ" target="_blank"     >MythBusters</a   >  for the real deal you just die in an instant by the way, once you get the idea   of rock paper scissors your girls sleepover is over Chisato lmao, and blah   blah whatever Alan Institute because I swear this DA thing is the most boring   entity in Anime history. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> This series has so much to offer, this is only   one but many summaries I can come up with to describe this original Anime. I'm   pretty sure I also missed a bunch of talk about the characters and such in   this episode alone, so be sure to look back on the action and see that car   crash again lol well at least no one died this episode haha is that good news   or bad news </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLtcs_e6YQOs2cpPFIIWzgGtRDMT7SIQQsTBergb-NnEehLixCEG1S4GSu-ucaq8pQTIuooNX1dOVV4xbFx9m43oojm71VtBvfpGiAd4lWiGlUP9t_FqsGhFnEnuJHOze7SKhYfFMBqEuumJIXW-WZxNt3SinCzd1hnTT9UgFLapX-zcBrbKAGYd6T/s320/lycoreco06_takina3.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW I did not get any SSRs in a               <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gacha" target="_blank">gacha</a>              after burning all my salary<br />(lmao oh yeah also scissors paper               stone)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1548"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="387"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyz9MMdBajmzOrvJkjYSNhy3CVyUGadG_yfGSa8AUCeUmMEOas52T_Swi9jwPWbzpuE1rZtrPAIdpTbxo7pQs-32vCyrwOShV8o8vVfJPAW3tZ7TLWnQ_8lDhGv4ntwfjTEe8qzkQ1ZI2cxU3fKe4aNGGkMNQ0KUFO1ekxGY11KEJANB2sX_uzTkhp/s387/lycoreco06_chisato6.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              And FINALLY I can patch up a half body outfit of a Lycoris haha<br />(MISSION               COMPLETE lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="180"                 data-original-width="320"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj23-N9mfbEpm9iOhhpnpOgnObHuy3Nk7JfTj-PV6qk1dRNgKrjwLZF6wlL6Ot1EKtc1PHyfzFgC6rZIvTUKKdd7fb5eM3k_XqAqPnd98psiDruTWq1QAKUbC82uwjrHLU0_QcRJwB1GepDlgPG9ArFmdNroXbk5RGGsGDpKSXXRmwbKqhMiqFHtRgm/s1600/lycoreco06_gobble.gif"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              "How do you savour good food?"<br />Me:             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

It's part of the contract.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where FINALLY we get a new character into this   action series hehe it's just me   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/12041/Rumi_Ookubo" target="_blank"     >don't think too much into it</a   >  (#EngageKiss06), wow what a great jebait we got this episode, so let's get   into it! Firstly, let's talk about the new girl in town. She's Sharon it took   us a little bit before we hear a name, so maybe Celestial Abbey as titled by   the subtitles will be a familiar name to you. No? Well neither does everyone   so let's start from the top. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Shuu got easy info again from some   mysterious person which I would not bother myself finding out to be honest,   but this time around he has the detective and his police friend hearing in   too, so that's more than one man to deal with but the target did leave swiftly   so not like these guys have any chances to find a fake wall in the tunnels   lol. Anyways, this Shaolin of a nun haha basically interfered in the demon   hunting operation of one of the other companies for some reason, and turns out   it might be from some international organization everyone knows of. In the   interest of capitalism let's just say her presence in these operations   especially taking down humans for information is affecting the budget of   the&nbsp; &nbsp;exercises of the local hunting industry lol, and I guess Shuu   forgot everything anyways haha how convenient, so tutorial time we go to   Ayano's mom for the details. So basically the Church (and I guess this is what   we will refer to for now "Seiten Church" isn't exactly a great name too thanks   Google Translate) is doing the same thing as everyone apart from doing church   things, and are here because they found out that these guys in Bayron City are   hiding a demon in their premises without exterminating it. Yep, they found   out, guys, time to surrender. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Of course, no one is going to give up   (spoiler alert) Kisara without a fight, so everyone including Ayano tried to   fight what seems to be titan powers and   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach" target="_blank"     >shinigami</a   >  speeds and reflexes lol, could not even touch a hair on this expert combatant   besides getting nailed down which I don't even mind so can I just replace   Shuu's position at some point? <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Anyways, after confronting the demon   hunting organizations in the area and snatching Ayano's phone while she's at   it, Sharon found Shuu's place and decided to... well kill is probably not an   option because surprise surprise, the scriptwriter of this series has already   drafted out how to put this new girl Sharon into Shuu's love life. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>   ANIME BABY!! Haha I know right did you forget this is also a romance series?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least though and actually most importantly, we can talk   about the flashback, and how important this will be as it's Shuu's discovery,   excuse me, fight, for Kisara. With Sharon. Oops, is this even the right   recollection? We don't know, don't ask Shuu how many people he has slept with;   Sharon doesn't have a social media account. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, this might be   the most informative episode yet as we continue to unveil more of Shuu's past   without actually asking him because well, Kisara knows everything now and we   want her dead so yeah either way bro your memories are going into dust.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> How did everything end up just like how Shuu wanted though with a   contract? I mean, it's not impossible to think about once you realize what the   Church or Sharon herself is up to we shall find out soon, then maybe we will   see if it's the ethical choice to be using a friendly demon to assist in demon   hunting spawned from a terrorist attack on a place with a ban on weapons. See   you guys then. </div><div>  [TL:DR; All these episodes are basically Shuu thinking he knows but then we   realize he doesn't because he sold all of it to the demon lmao] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfTgo1gKjgWwYYGe13dV4CoOL8jInXF2OyzwJjdIa6VHHxB-MrRgcHZ7sb8ilw4isMjjpPYG7C7LoLpQPlkb1f5K6gl8jVcVSYk3mPg6AuKyVuD73pULhhtTa9FKzlvmk-kGx5mg7MCCsTigdcd3Ig4ZLLBZH2g3D30S_hf3adlRrt8ZxKcMdBFs9o/s320/engagekiss06_punch.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week on violence we have:<br />Dude if she can make a crevice               on the cement your face is in trouble lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbX-EUal23KOidOwEKdZEEa6vR5vQ94N_ulMuKINuN7tRSe2j_FRQnIsWD0wy5BdBUOpxziUDtkXOE9aL3r4iXI2Yb_HKkePzeuPqUxzrZTxIGrfCpXcki2-aWWBprd1vVN9cY84HoK4vrXmqJ2zf6iajHILeEKVXTSUnmlUqmt0sReubx0oP2B0GU/s320/engagekiss06_swing.jpg"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week on violence we have:<br />I mean, this is kinda normal               at this point so             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Sure man, call me up if I have enough time to listen to all of them because   you know, what's stopping me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, great list of additions to the   library to be honest, but that doesn't mean all are winners.   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/alive-ep/1635561575?l=en"       target="_blank"       >ClariS new single</a     ></b   >  is an expected disappointment mainly because if you haven't been listening to   their traditional style B-sides you would know unless they are as impressive   as the A-side topic songs as I would refer to, those aren't getting into my   list anytime soon. I was expecting   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%92%E3%83%9F%E3%83%84%E6%81%8B%E3%82%B4%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AD-ep/1629870185?l=en"       target="_blank"       >CHiCO with HoneyWorks new single</a     ></b   >  to be better or even to be in review once again thanks to the Anime I watch   but unfortunately as much early listen as I gave the B-side I don't think this   one is coming on to my shelf of discs. Oh well, CHiCO-san, next time.   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%9A%81/1634556196?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Porno Graffitti's new album</a     ></b   >  in 5 years is also expected in disappointment mainly because I was never into   their style as I would like to remind myself I did tune out of their channel   around 3 years from 2013 so not surprising this wouldn't get me back into them   as much as   <a     href="https://twitter.com/tsunomakiwatame/status/1433778822155943938?s=20&amp;t=Cj-ZX_ZWlcerCIib2jAaaA"     target="_blank"     >VTuber Tsinomaki Watame</a   >  as a fan will ever. But I did give some of the songs though devoid of music   video premieres on YouTube in the past few weeks and even ones from 2018, so   that's fine I guess. Overall not great though, don't expect too much   especially if you have heard of the vocalist's solo music career during the   break.   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/into-the-time-hole/1636321525?l=en"       target="_blank"       >GLIM SPANKY's new album</a     ></b   >  was the bigger disappointment because I really thought they can deliver but   somehow their oldie Rock style did not hit me so I just ended up taking the   album topic song instead as heard from the live festival recently too. Trust   me, I gave them second chances. Ironically though, as I did remind myself to   listen to   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/abracada-boo-ep/1630860888?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Ishihara Kaori's new single</a     >s</b   >  yes the two of them and got even more interested in the one I gave chance to   as shown above because I gave the music video with the (sshh) dancing haha,   but stayed for the B-side which has a familiar composer because I have heard   from him from Ueda Reina before. Yeah, it's a PONY CANYON thing so... I guess   Kyari-san!! Haha welcome to my shelf I guess. I also noticed that I   accidentally (lol) gave the B-side to   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%BD%A9%E8%89%B2%E7%A1%9D%E5%AD%90-ep/1607963660?l=en"     target="_blank"     >Asakura Momo's single from March</a   >  so I guess we'll be talking about that in due time too.

Everyone sounds the same- <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, voice cute girls   for me again, Ookubo Rumi, but maybe not those girly ones I can't stand   watching those. *<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kusun" target="_blank"     >sun</a   >* <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys next time then again, and excuse me while I continue to   fix... not this site but the future of this site so that its next migration   will be as smooth as my career- That one I think it's screwed already lol   can't we just not and instead talk about how much I want same year Kyari-san   to be my girl now??
