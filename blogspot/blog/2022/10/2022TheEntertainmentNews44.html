I   think I did the most of anything just today morning to be honest, working on   the GitHub site. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh yeah, there's the happy Tuesday earlier which I   did two posts in one day that was crazy, and then my body went crazy   afterwards so... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, life hits me so hard right now I may have to   set up an exercise regime to fix myself so I can continue doing all of this. </div><div><br /></div><div><span title="*silence*">😐</span></div><div><br /></div><div>  INB4 I still do nothing to improve my physical wellness haha what I WILL do   though tomorrow, me, is to sign up again for   <a href="https://www.inorimachi.com/" target="_blank"     >Minase Inori's fanclub</a   >. Yes, <i>again</i>. First problem I foresee is that, my membership number   won't work no more which kinda sucks to be honest but let's see what's the new   number tomorrow, yes? </div><div><br /></div><div>  You may ask, why tomorrow and not today? Because tomorrow's the day where I   joined her fanclub exactly 3 years ago- Happy Halloween everybody. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzakiChanS205">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "What did you do, Sakurai-kun?" Man what DIDN'T he do lol     </div>  </blockquote>  Boy, did I have to look back to recall what happened but yeah, the mom.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this unlikely romance plot where the mother can come into play lol   (#UzakiChanS205), we need the people from the café to do analysis on last   episode? BRUH. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But the guys are right though, at this time period   where Hana-chan is still confused at her relationship with her   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a>...   SOMEONE GIVE ME ANOTHER BOWL OF RICE lol okay me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, remember what   happened previously because I hope you did? But yeah the mother dropped by the   café for two good reasons: To check if the daughter has so far caused any   problems with her mood swings... towards Sakurai which surprisingly only   towards him, but also, to get some consultation from the Asai family. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Ah hey, they seem to be the only ones clear about the whole situation and how   dumb all these people are anyways lol I REALLY wish I had someone like this   around me who can't get their love for me so I can tell her back but DAMN,   these guys are dumb. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hana-chan eventually found out that the   "boyfriend" calling the mom by her first name is bad, so let's just slap the   first names on everyone. Yes, Akihito-kun included haha that's the café owner   by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Damn, does saying "Hana-chan" repeatedly remind me of   that one Anime "Asobi Asobase" haha you gotta say it like   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/character/171001/Hanako_039_s_Grandfather"     target="_blank"     >the pervert of a granddad</a   >  <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then, we have the gym trial session. I am NOT going to advocate going   to the gym because what Sakurai imagined (Uzaki) Hana-chan will react is right   because spending money to exercise is ridiculous either get up your own a** to   do it or don't ever, but hey, Sakurai is so ripped only the guy who spotted   him on the bench press can tell me why he's okay with doing more reps without   getting tired. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And yes, the narrator's retort on that being the head   of the Uzaki family really didn't get me until I took a rewind. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Problem is though, as he heads home after work (at the gym) and listens to the   daughter and wife talk about this awesome senpai at college and THEN realizes   it's a male, really starts stirring sh*t up by calling in a family meeting and   announcing to the world without using a loudspeaker because he is one himself.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, dad, good news for you, if this IS the son-in-law you is   starting off with a good one. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But seriously though, what is wrong   with the guys in this house haha. All in all... the family confusion is half   this season from now huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, also, Sakurai getting RIPPED <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Really not into the latter though maybe Ami-chan would but he might want to   tune it down for me but otherwise!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Between exercising and eating   MORE rice watching the action unfold... this is turning out to be the   healthiest or even most organic episode of Anime this season to be honest   haha. But hey, what's stopping us from making this even more irritating than   ever? It's the slogan for the series too. Really, all stemming from Uzaki Hana   herself too, by the way. But yeah, what's wrong with stayover friends of the   opposite gender? It's 2022 dude, we gotta be more open about that, <i>dad</i>.   Hehe we shall see more next week I guess this might not be a thing Sakaki can   solve now </div><div>  [TL:DR; "(Sakurai) He's so pitiful, I'm doing him a favour by paying some   attention to him!" This is literally it, we get better summaries with every   episode haha] </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2yGBgq7j5lCWr4Co7fRNrNzCDpG9Cf-MS6oFPLUJnkPDgKLKwwVGNme4cNBlrRDDM2UoP8IWlvcwv0F-m1QPVD6cPIrl7F-qOYcrMzuCffVzI8PUyddYF2i0cS0G5WUUHdiHwaS2F7a5wxg0VJhOyE4OOdVO_-QV0KQjCIWRL_9JppRrQ1R9qOwf0/s320/uzakichanS205_akihito.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            About to be me acting cute when I turn 30 lmao           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTQKTLxyS6I9Ml5wP7hUBDcTulLrHxu7pMm78Pc-frAa3OWpoaFuwHCTeks8SxhguhXPLydFH8ELCW_1SCCtdoGA1Gi_z8z1pyWiHjIIgOM6B5apGOasOCDoLhsfhSk9NEkPjaL1Am2FGLn6Wkf7x8Pdy4MUwahHS4DRDD7N6YFxo8XhyxC0QnP-TJ/s320/uzakichanS205_fujio2.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I still don't have worthy Halloween costume selfies to put as my             phone wallpaper haha<br />*panik*           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  P.S.

Boy, may I never dream about       the deceased lol I have enough anxieties     </div>  </blockquote>  Man, we are already at the point we wait for the emperor to arrive at the   Consort's abode? Damn. What will happen in the final episode? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As we   sit patiently for the emperor to tell us of his troubles in this new episode   (#KoukkyuNoKarasu05), we have flipped the opening?? Damn, how did everything   got me good? Hmm... looks like I need to tell my troubles to the Raven Consort   too. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Speaking of such, we have the emperor's aide (which I will   refer to from now on because I hate Japanese-translated Chinese names lol I'm   not racist I am Chinese myself) to talk about. If you would recall the emperor   having sleepless nights due to uh... his past haunting him haha man like it's   not only him who could see too so that's just creepy, would not reveal this   problem to Jusetsu I guess who specializes in dealing with the passing,   instead instructed the aide to continue on the search for what might be the   rebellion sorcerer in place and might be found roaming in the city recently   too. Ironically though, we have also learnt about the aide's problems and past   after being out there, with him passing by the red light district and   recalling her mom's journey of being disowned by the husband after having the   kid wtf, and then killing herself leaving the kid alone and having to make a   choice between getting laid by dudes or getting laid by dudes as a eunuch.   *ahem* Like really, *ahem* what's the difference? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Yep, still   referring to *ahem* as "period drama, by the way") He almost puked at the   sight of anxiety of having to continue his search for the sorcerer which   really reminds of myself in this aspect- Okay besides the eunuch part, my   dong's still on me so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Besides that though, his loyalty is still to   the emperor who saved him from the crutches of the alpha gays in the palace   lmao *ahem*, and instead of watching his master suffer in silence over the   ghosts every night appearing at his abode, he decided to go against all odds   and tell on him to the Raven Consort whom he still doesn't trust somehow   considering he also knew this girl has grey hair? Man, dear emperor, you need   to keep your mouth shut. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, frienemies, I guess. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Uh   oh we have an EARLY ENDING THOUGH??? Cringe indeed, because what's up is just   a little more spoiler to what we have been spoiling for episodes already at   this point, because as Jusetsu is granted access to the treasury in search of   more history that the dynasties have buried, she saw a map. A map we have seen   in the opening many times but have no idea what it was. Maybe, just maybe, we   might be at the start of talking about the backstory of the Raven Consort   which the emperor doesn't know but heck I think Jusetsu herself might not know   much of too. Damn, this is really getting spicy I want to know what's this   small dose of poison that is threatening this new empire. Really, never been   this excited for *ahem* by the way I got bored of period dramas when I was in   primary (elementary) school so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> great time to be watching this once in   a while though, somewhat refreshing since there is magic in this too. Yeah,   "Heike Monogatari", you might be dropped at some point this year lmao I am so   not sorry for this </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_2DTSQdSLLiGckOD2ty6M8tHBdtGkS1Dw9f1mvIlIBqguD9wgmoi6I5-Rj_hf5BBjQMZp80-fOa0Etq3t88Ogtqm6d6m27Kx6a1agmslLXwe6qyy0nB-yY8C5Mg0zBFc8ceVo-62ijV8Jm3P7GOBV4h-fwPi33RdxToErFKix-H3X7Jypr41c87vS/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_xinging.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MVP golden chicken as always haha           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAPne41D1G3miEcaFcqEVfvCdGZm3twa5cqBDboKlaH1oMatl4t2o2-6jSmnuwgWLC2QbPc4CEUpRNNkBFJtmgPfcmmg2oqKGzzsIG-5AHfPu3YnNiVpu7it329hoA6z5AWmZ7suQSfOVasiPIigvz7JXJOapTMft_IeFbMV4hy4D9fzU_LhbWEiRE/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_puke.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Literally me half this weekend lol I need to see the doctor           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="1184"               data-original-width="1280"               height="296"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSfBfA7VlIR6yL68QiBcACUdIGtDl1eukRqMp_eoHCGCiBJplctfNNABT1a_nuhgfnca9mXA5ys5GK62FV3odyfHYYLJiSr3b1zOHiAB4VBtiOO33NEUmcvXqdfXk5Zs_-ogXXoYCSoY54w9zEgFJobH5EsUdmeMDGhfx6iYHuI0KODN72cWaBCVSf/s320/koukyuunokarasu05_jusetsu5.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            And yes sadist Raven Consort haha stare down at me please<br />(lol)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  P.S.

Or maybe not, I really don't want to give it anymore haha </div><div>  <br />  There isn't a lot in the news department from Twitter maybe because it got   bought out by a billionaire lmao,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1584923580902518784?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Amamiya Sora's recent live is now on music streaming services</a     ></b   >  the time it was posted I didn't see it though haha but as of this post it is,   also&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1586009906636652544?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >SID's live audio library will be on major streaming services</a     ></b   >  released in parts and the first batch is already making me miss 2010 haha   <span title="*sob*">😢</span>,&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1584499957834432513?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Fuchigami Mai's new song will be released next week</a     ></b   >  so I guess I'll listen to that before commenting and this is by the way for   her concept album next year,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/lounge666/status/1585164324787585025?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >SIX LOUNGE's new music video</a     ></b   >  is for their major debut EP released this week and it's dope as usual,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1585194572665466881?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >GLIM SPANKY's new song</a     ></b   >  for drama will also be releasing next week I hope it's better than the whole   of their recent album lol,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/CrosSing_info/status/1585224734379151360?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Taketatsu Ayana singing ClariS' debut song</a     ></b   >  is such a mood I am only filled with nostalgia,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/engage_kiss/status/1585209635790897154?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Anime "Engage Kiss" character song for Sharon</a     ></b   >  is not too bad but I must say character songs aren't really getting to me so   I'll give chance once it's out in a month,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1585664011164536832?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >PHONO TONES' new song</a     ></b   >  released this weekend and it's happy enough for me to worry about my troubles   lol,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/yucat1031/status/1585945742287327232?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >yucat's recent live digest</a     ></b   >&nbsp;is up to listen and man looks like we are closer than ever to the new   album which I will not be able to listen on streaming haha,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1585964966229987329?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >RYTHEM's new old music video</a     ></b   >  is something simple yet nice I wish I can go back to a decade ago,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/AmazonJPmusic/status/1585119150061785088?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Ikimonogakari's now only producer Mizuno Yoshiki is releasing a full solo       album</a     ></b   >  next year so yeah he will be singing which I won't be so keen to be honest not   even with my decade's training of listening to male vocals, but I will listen   to   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1586326998380646400?s=20&amp;t=-0yY65JHGT0t5YY2Mxu_wg"       target="_blank"       >Yoru no Honki Dance's recent live premiere</a     ></b   >  on YouTube which is still going on as I speak so ask me whether I like them   Honki Dance's live or not- Yes. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> </div><div>  <br />  Next week though, we will be starting super slow next month, we only have   <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b> for the Anime Naruto series so I'm not going to   look forward to that much haha also these guys aren't exactly my thing even   though they have earned the title of Collection Artist in Klassic Note   already, still crossing fingers on their impression on me every time I have to   give them something. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> We shall see I guess.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />Man, I'm feeling so unwell I think I might have the virus. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>   Will report later after this post (haha yes) to see if I truly got the thing,   or else this itself might also be serious.
