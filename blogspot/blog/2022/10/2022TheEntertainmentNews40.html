But now we are at the new month, I can't wait to have to deal with exercise again <span title="*pukes*">🤮</span> Haha okay me get over it <div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, be sure to check out what I've unboxed earlier this week, and   starting this weekend, we are exploring new Anime for the season! New Anime,   new season you know- We will see if any will stick, or else I might spend more   time on weekends to play video games. There's that Potion Permit have I've   seen it in summer games festivals that's kinda fun. It's like that Anime last   season about   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/isekai" target="_blank">isekai</a> pharmacy   I didn't watch and it has Aki-chan in it. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Oh well haha </div><div><br /></div><div>  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rettsu" target="_blank">LET'S</a>&nbsp;Anime   and music talk!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzakiChanS201">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! Double</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "One-upping       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">Senpai</a> is       what makes my life worth living" We reaching that stage already huh haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Merry Christmas, everybody- This should've aired next season. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah,   we went from them being hostile to each other to in this new season of a sweet   romance in progress series (#UzakiChanS201), hanging out and enjoying their   time with each other. Wholesome, wholesome content- Wait, let me get my rice   cooker going. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, this episode definitely easily served as a summary   episode to remind all of us the fun we had over the first season, and what   will be like going forward. In summary? I mean, we know they are not dating,   but they TOTALLY are. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Because firstly, we have Sakaki and I swear I   almost forgot his name, hanging out with these two after summer vacation is   over, because damn, whoever sucked at bowling wouldn't even matter if it's   just a battle of wits and Uzaki just shouting behind Sakurai's back as he   rolls the ball so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You get the idea, the usual banter these two have,   and us just watching all of it happening. We are of course also reminded of   how to not get provoked by Uzaki so she can't do much to you which Sakurai is   often failing at lol, and how Sakurai is also then improving his own skills   outside of video games so he can gain an edge when having to deal with Uzaki's   antics, like winning her at bowling to not get a punishment. I mean, fair   game, amirite? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Then, we have Ami-chan. If you TRULY need a reminder   about this absolute pervert of a girl running the cafe with the father who   just left the premises for a bit, oh boy let me tell you how much this girl   wants to see Sakurai's muscles and Uzaki in... well anything cute because   ironically apart from Uzaki having a larger rack than hers haha this is a   thing in this Anime by the way "it's so big" is the series' middle name lmao,   still loved to don up Uzaki-chan in some of the best cosplay we will see in a   decade (haha) until you know, the two of them find out what she intends to do   and/or the father appears so what else is new. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But hey, I'll take an   Anime where   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/6996/Ayana_Taketatsu" target="_blank"     >Taketatsu Ayana</a   >  is an absolute pervert, I'll tell you that much. Heck, I'll even take her   dressed as a bunny girl as punishment for making us nosebleed so much. The   character of voice actress? Yes. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Even the mom wants in on the action   too lol MOVING ON haha, I... uh... can only talk about how much I can relate   to these two not getting enough sleep but NOT because I played video games   till the dead of night, sadly. But hey, what is stopping anyone from sleeping   in the school premises? <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Even together at a bench? Snugged in tight?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, oh boy I am easily reminded of the pace of the series and   also how much fun I had watching this first season up till now, so I'm excited   to see more of these banters going forward. With a new cast of characters   mostly involving Uzaki's family, we will see how much more these two will go   to admit they are going steady. I mean, is sleeping together without a   confession going steady? Asking for a friend lmao </div> <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="180"               data-original-width="320"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEio7208vWaL_SSCVsDcaj8MSriD8nktktl76-JhXH5f4H7EWPe7y6YC6FZJwkCbLMeXiidFRmvEaL1Z8q-t22SBjy5GAw3S0shH0910NEX70rkL2nY42qD4jfhe0TH8unO4Z7fNa8TAGe82_OkebeDdoP4vEf_QTaFaPpJvmSmJ2M7yozGxDa_i-0dM/s1600/uzakichanS201_grin.gif"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kowai" target="_blank">KOWAI</a>            lol           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="180"               data-original-width="320"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNPodJLkL_FyqLqXNHNeHNi2mhkRP1V55belpDpL7jLggiGg-j8PpYCYfCtUaQu9_mwu4fuXZkcSJJ_XykUx2ujmmiHxcNkJM8DtUZoITv4Qh5pM-lgIfpdW6y-Uk04qrLOw5VlvHplLbCJbZOm6Kwg9VYeyVgJUR3ilii5-5EjIQ5gSGborYvhzii/s1600/uzakichanS201_caress.gif"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I don't care if this will get me banned but WHO DID THIS lmao           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  P.S.

I'm sorry I'll leave haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Oh, looks like someone got disowned and had the balls to come take back his   land, interesting. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> In this first episode of a series I'm taking a   look at (#KokkyuNoKarasu01), I'm not that keen on period dramas so let me put   this out first whatever my decision is though, whenever I do this *ahem* I'm   stating the fact that "this is a period drama, by the way", so don't forget   how unforgiving this story can be. But how can we forget the night where the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/koutaigou" target="_blank"     >empress dowager</a   >'s throne was taken from her... for good reason, right? Yeah turns out, we   have some story to talk about which should be typical of this series, but   getting the reason out will be harder than you think, because women. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   *ahem* Okay me, but really, getting even (I'm going to forget the name   "Jusetsu" so) the Raven Consort to help with her mysterious powers likely   passed from the gods is also not going to be an easy task. As with the role of   this specific Consort, she only does favours after exhausting all options, or   that, if she is demanded by the leader of the palace which of course, now is   based on this new emperor so I guess she can speak. Still, quite a character   to not listen to demand, but hey, maybe some good food will quill her temper.   *ahem* Haha anyways, the story we are doing in this specific arc somehow is   dealing with a ghost and a jade earring which was found by the emperor, but   that's as much as he knew. Being a man of authority, I guess he can't blend in   to the masses to find out more of where this item came from but the Consort   can? Hmm... *ahem* so what else is new. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She did get some buns to eat   out of it so I guess she's gotta work for it. Speaking of work, she went down   in disguise to the servant's nest and talked to Jiu-Jiu (<a     href="https://twitter.com/kokyu_anime/status/1575077865934114819?s=20&amp;t=tJaXIdRQVH52rsy5FQlD3g"     target="_blank"     >Marinka</a   >, by the way, and the first reason I'm watching this lol) which quickly led   her to the older servants who talked about the history of the premises, about   how the dowager banished the heir to emperor after taking over leadership, how   she was more feminist than most men in that era lol *ahem*, and how supposedly   one of the Consorts hanged herself after being accused of a murder of another   pregnant Consort which, you know, will then be a potential heir should anyone   else not bear any children for the current leader so *ahem* haha you see why I   needed this abbreviation now? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, and that's how every day at the   servants' quarters is a joy with all this gossip haha why know the truth when   it's none of your business and you can make them up? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> PERIOD DRAMA,   BY THE WAY- Oops. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And looks like, basically, the emperor is intending   to punish the dowager for her crimes properly and not be a ruthless ruler like   her to use violence which is good, we have a nice guy coming into the new Era,   good news. Pity the guys at the doorstep though, they didn't have a choice.   *ahem* All in all haha, you KNOW this is Anime because "kawaii" was mentioned   in this series lol, you know this is a mystery waiting to unfold considering   we have already been given this much just in episode one, and YOU KNOW that   old b*tch will not stand to be locked in a palace so hell yeah I hope you will   enjoy what is coming up as much as I do, to be honest. As such, and why am I   using such a formal tone lol, I'll give this the three-episode rule, which   will likely end this mini arc too. Then maybe, <i>maybe</i>, we'll find out   why the emperor is in the middle of the lake peeping at girls taking a wash.   Haha see you guys then *ahem* </div><div>  [TL:DR; Okay doesn't matter if I finish watching this, but XING-XING MVP!!!   Haha that golden bird, can we not have that also have a corresponding human   cosplay?

Haha maybe it's just the mood, though. But I did try to get my mood back to   listen to   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%87%BA%E7%94%BA%E6%9F%B3%E3%83%91%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A6%E3%83%8B%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-ep/1644069211?l=en"       target="_blank"       >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</a     ></b   >  because Anime "Yojouhan" series but also because I forgot how chill you have   to be in mood to give any of their styles. So yeah, turned back around to give   the A-side after I gave one of the B-sides where the guitarist also got his   vocal input. No single review though. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/armadillo-ep/1644299724?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Yoru no Honki Dance's new mini-album</a     ></b   >  isn't exactly the best thing they have released so far but I gotta say they   have not been in years I'm rather disappointed, because I ended up giving the   song which was released two months ago instead of the new songs that have   music videos to top them up. Oh well, nice try, I guess. I did still give a   couple more songs because they are regulars though.&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/welcome-to-my-wonderland/1644299193?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Touyama Nao's new album</a     ></b   >  is also not that great, because as I said the   <a     href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1576497222341959680?s=20&amp;t=BEFOSLuHP8rqpjtbJmU72g"     target="_blank"     >amusement park theme</a   >  didn't make this experience any better my benchmark is at 2015 with   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/harukarisk-land/972592545?l=en"     target="_blank"     >Tomatsu Haruka's 3rd album</a   >  and that's why I can state which album it specifically is I remembered it that   deeply, still got me with a couple of songs as I listen to them again so I'll   take those.&nbsp;<b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tenk-you-ep/1644991883?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Takahashi Minami's 10th anniversary mini-album</a     ></b   >&nbsp;(where unlike Kayano Ai's album which is not on digital lol) is not   exactly what I want especially with the singing voice lol but that doesn't   mean the moods of the songs aren't good, so I took not the topic song. Been my   motivation lately so I think it is good. This is how you gauge a new song is   good, right?<br />  <br />Looks like we don't have much on music news on Twitter well within my   scope, I might give a listen to   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/amuse_official/status/1574715482397196291?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >AMUSE VOICE ACTORS album to release in December</a     ></b   >  if I'm really bored because I know Tomita Miyu and Isobe Karin and the latter   could use some more singing with others sadly I wish this is a list of solo   songs,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/honkidance/status/1574775881582579712?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >Yoru no Honki Dance's new music video</a     ></b   >  did not get me again after Wednesday because I swear the melody impression is   getting in the way,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/VP_official/status/1575802884163219456?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >VELTPUNCH's new music video</a     ></b   >  for their single in weeks is a meh and I hope the other A-side in this double   release will be good,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1575835205864419330?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >ClariS is finally on THE FIRST TAKE</a     ></b   >&nbsp;in person which is run by their parent company Sony Music Japan lol and   they sung their most popular song ever so popular even Alice sung it a decade   ago <span title="*sob*">😢</span>,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1576149941973528576?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >Takahashi Rie's new song is available for pre-order</a     ></b   >  which also means you don't get to hear it yet so I'll listen when it's out,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1576226681374867457?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a     ></b   >&nbsp;(<a     href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1576227189686575104?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"     target="_blank"     >with subtitles</a   >, by the way) gave us an oldie style tune and music video in 4:3 aspect ratio   so I hope this is what carries me to listen to her album in two weeks,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1576174967258959873?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >Aimer's new mini-album is confirmed for December</a     ></b   >  release which includes some of the songs mentioned these few months, and   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/glimspanky/status/1576494886924488704?s=20&amp;t=BUqlZtleIpYo-zQtqLCThg"       target="_blank"       >GLIM SPANKY's new song is for a drama series</a     ></b   >&nbsp;with Ishiwara Junji writing the lyrics apparently. I guess the   adaptation requires more specific lyrics to be in the song, or else why not   let the band write it, right? I don't know I don't second guess the Japanese   music industry <span title="*wink*">😉</span> </div><div>  <br />  So for next week, we only have <b>Ueda Reina's new mini-album</b> which the   topic song didn't really stick with me so if that sucks haha I now have a   larger backlog of live performances so we will find something better than   Awesome City Club. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  And that's all for this week! Man, it's starting October and I'm already   tired. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Thankfully, I'll get myself immersed with playing video   games... progressing slowly but surely... to curb the work... stress or   boredom or whatever until the next package comes. Gotta say though? Might   become best package for the year. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> See you all by then, and until next   time, go find out that Potion Permit game and tell me whether I should romance   Martha who works at the tavern or Rue ie. the Mayor's daughter which I first   saved and the very reason I started on this adventure. I know right, even   Stardew Valley didn't give me this hard of a decision lol by the way I chose   Abigail because we be gaming day and night <span title="*dabs*">😎</span><br /></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
