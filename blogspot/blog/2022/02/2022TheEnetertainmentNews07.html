From listening to songs I heard as a kid playing video games when I was working (<span title="*sob*">😢</span>), to earlier today I was watching some Twitch streamer reviewing his old videos... These might have hit me too hard than I would want to. Hey, better not think of quitting my job now until things get peaceful and THEN we can jump haha note to self please <div><br /></div><div>  Ignoring nostalgia, I got to move forward, so moving forward, let's watch some   Anime and listen to new songs! Well next week won't have many new songs so   that sucks, but hey, last week's still new. Also, good reminder that I'm STILL   not getting laid this year OR have anyone to go out with on Valentine's Day OR   even someone to give me chocolates lol but yeah, should've done some stupid   promise to a girl in middle school to date each other if we're still single by   30. *looks at my age* Oh well, can't turn back time now haha lets do this then   that stream took the whole Sunday morning already </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan80">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "From here on, things will not go your way. Only Eren will get what he       wants" Oh man...     </div>  </blockquote>  Wow dude, thought I got over not watching Grisha kill all those people   including Frieda but f**k me man. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Now that my brain is scarred for   life and that's why you can't air these until after midnight lmao, in this new   episode (#AttackOnTitan80) I can only tell you it'll be more exciting for you   if you have always thought that Zeke is correct. No really, it blew my mind,   what a plot twist from last week. Anyways, they have to fight it out now, I've   seen so much blood I don't even want to talk anymore lol, but seriously, is it   an action series if you don't see red? I mean, look at "BLEACH". <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, story. I don't even know how to start. Let's talk about origin story.   This is easy, as we see Ymir reflect on her past after we know Eren is in   control... maybe know he's still in shackles, and as Zeke ordered Ymir to do   what he desires which is euthanization this is still a thing by the way, Ymir   recalls her past of how she lived in a village eons ago. So, long story short,   it's your usual 2k years ago village being pillaged by what looks like   medieval knights or whatever, and the whole village either got erased or the   people were enslaved to do what they please. Typical of that time unlike the   peace we have today in real life, but what made her different is she let   someone go out of kindness. That, she got ratted out by the other slaves just   because one of their eyes are on the line lol, and the leader of that tribe   let her go. Of course, if you think those barbarians who enslaved people would   be nice at this point, think again. For letting her go is to chase her down as   an example of defying orders, and... she barely managed to survive. Falling   into some body of water and encountering a parasite of some sort though (I   swear I read the mid-episode summary of that origin, and only thought of it as   parasite since can this even look like God? lol) (Yeah sounds like a parasite   which can become Titan big if in contact with human anatomy), Ymir transformed   into a Titan, and that's where our true story began. She proved useful when   going back to the tribe of the Eldians (OOF <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>) and even allowed them to   expand and conquer enemies like the Marleys (DOUBLE OOF <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>) to dominate   the land. (Like, why not just kill the guys who enslaved you though? lol ok   me) Sadly or if you think otherwise, all it takes for one soldier to throw a   spear at the leader and Ymir's sacrifice for the Lord immediately turned her   into a dead body... and that's where we saw the Paths. So summary, human meets   plankton and becomes Titan, doesn't really die after death but since she's the   Founder here, no one is there to heal her actual body so she heals the next   guy who appears most likely unless their life runs out holding those powers   which if you need a reminder is about 13 years OR gets eaten by others which   is why probably no one will step in here unless the former happens before the   latter which is unlikely because remember the passing of powers? *nods head*   So yeah, that is pretty much it, this series, we figured it out. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Anyways, coming back, turns out the walls are Ymir's three children which also   likely hold part of her powers as "creations", but even ignoring that, we know   Ymir thinks she doesn't have a right or say even after death, which is why she   still obeys every command of the Eldian descendants who appear in here.   Ironic, that's Zeke, but Eren had other ideas. Forcibly removing the chains on   his arms like he's a Titan lmao, he convinced Ymir to make decisions on her   own, and I guess we didn't know that she is innately evil? I mean, if you undo   the walls and give Eren your Founding Titan powers ie. do The Rumbling, I'll   pretty sure you're evil. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> With the unlocked power, Eren addressed   every Eldian that is still alive (hopefully not those outside of the island   but who knows) his original intention and in case you haven't figured it out   and still think Zeke is going to make things happen, which is: To use   Eldian... found Titan powers to eradicate all humans outside of the island   completely. Yep, you heard that right, Gabi was pardoned for shooting Eren in   the neck. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, who knows what happened to her now, okay? But yeah,   Armin was not exactly right since the power was now NOT used to fight Marley's   incoming forces but in a more general term... let's just say there are   millions or even billions of people out there to erase, and Eren's going to   attempt the very first speedrun. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> All in all, goddamn this is getting   better by the episode, I feel like we're close to the end. What will happen of   Eren's ego, and what happened to Zeke now? We shall find out soon, but looks   like we going to clean up the mess soon so we can approach Eren for...   anything at this point I don't know, to stop him? Haha we shall see how to do   that or otherwise soon enough </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgFUoY09_hqdTzjKC83_z6-J9ZZrsex5LnEgtrL1EFa_LhY4F8W9C4xwzG6e0Vp3itr_qDHaOlhqaAvucDpHm50KEsXe9NnZRsdKbtkm43epWao7FGKnv7NkVE29PrrSh5WC3HqaRGY9Fd9xAYH14D1foGmOFXOXdea5YireO6RnkqOExFixooa-n0y=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              My colleagues during lunch on my first day at work<br />("New guy               buys the drinks" lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgCD4WYgNy2AeuzKNgCMfd7XXunWj8f7jMK_gQCz0nvTTHX2Bb6gzMSYKvwt6CEz9ttT-xfKJbJ2FZfWoNSygD_Std7ARE8r_WQYkltlwopj9Dn64JVCFpyAl0957hEaxd_hx4eHtAyF_oHbULlly1sZuQkP2sInN1U9d29UeMK1K696x36agQk_HU0=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW Eren wants to be the bad guy lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Oh well can't get away from that now you're   born in one<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS306">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Oh, I hope she doesn't think that I want to ask her out (on the rooftop)"       Oh well, Nishikata, she might think otherwise but okay <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     </div>  </blockquote>  Haha wow that was some cute opening singing right there. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Oh, it's   called the "la la la" version, by the way, very cute. No, that is NOT   Takagi-san because they want you to know opening theme song artist Ohara Yuiko   is cute too. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> In this new episode where we kick-off the school   festival lol (#TakagiSanS306), whoever thought of the dumplings role needs to   be kicked out of school. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, do you want a coincidental screw-up   and end up with a happy ending together, or create that coincidence and then   end up as if nothing happened? The latter is part of my school life I'll never   tell lmao, but the former sounds like a classic romance plot waiting to   unravel. And I think this is it, this episode. So, story. The school festival   is up, the guys are still rehearsing for the play of course, so Nishikata how   did you think that you asking Takagi out to the rooftops is because you wanted   to confess... Yeah right like that'll happen. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, don't jinx it, me,   he has to do it at some point because I can't imagine the marriage proposal   from the girl lmao. Anyways, rehearsal is going on real well, Yukari is too   anxious as director it's hard for her to eat and sleep lol poor girl, and   before your eyes can blink, it's the actual day. Nishikata thought a showdown   on walking through the haunted house in the festival would freak Takagi out   just because he intended to go 10 rounds on it first lol, but we all figured   out that Takagi isn't afraid of anything and Nishikata freaks out at anything   so yeah, guess who won. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Or Takagi knows someone inside the maze and   gets them to show her the shortcut out. Haha Nishikata you have no idea.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, straight to the actual event, the play. A lot of things happened   before and during the play which made Yukari mad probably since the script got   ruined somehow, but of course, we get to see the actual main couple come   together at the end. How though? Well it all started with lunch where Kimura   had to, and I say, HAD TO, join the eating contest, so him having to later be   in the main role of the class' play might prove to be an issue but we will   mention that again later, but as the class managed to follow the script   perfectly the teacher was enjoying so much we won't shed more tears of   laughter or sadness than that dude lol, but yeah, at least Nishikata didn't   screw up his part as Dumpling A lmao. Good for him, for something else is   about to happen that will turn the tides on this play. So, bringing back   Kimura's diarrhoea which should be happening around now, he had to bail for   the toilet in line with the final scene of the play which according to   Mina-chan, the princess and that pig (I meant Juliott lmao) had to die   together so what's better than that than getting Nishikata to be the   replacement and THEN letting Takagi trip on a fake chestnut which Kimura   dropped earlier so Nishikata can be the hero and actually save the princess   from her fall. Man, like, you feel that?? THAT is how you know you found the   right guy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Of course they had to fake it out considering the pig head   is not on the prince after the save, and the princess fell instead of kill   herself with a knife lol. Also, probably not like Nishikata can remember the   lines for the prince in record time to not screw up, so you know, at least   they made it sound like they were together with the power of love or   something. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Yeah, I know, Takagi is totally enjoying this haha. Like   really, Nishikata wished the curtains will draw down faster as in just drop   the cloth down immediately so he can avoid another second being in embrace   with Takagi-san...? Please kill me now, please. Someone give me the dagger   prop. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, what is with the ending animation it's so much   chibi haha, Houjou is MVP of this episode prove me wrong lmao, and Takagi   probably enjoyed every single part of that last scene of the play dropping   hints to the innocent dude who technically did save her skin during the actual   play. Good for you Nishikata, I already know why I'm not getting laid in   middle school because I wasn't nice enough to save some girl around me who was   about to eat the ground. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Like, what more do you want from   this series? I feel like I've had my fill like how Kimura is after lunch at   the festival, and I think I'm going to have to go to the toilet real soon, so   I hope that is only in 6 weeks time when this series end and I cry in the   toilet about my lonely existence. Happy Valentine's Day everyone. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  [TL:DR; I'm pretty sure Nishikata is his voice Kaji Yuki as a middle schooler   minus the romance probably lmao] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="1888"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="472"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh6VoNSQEI-84CEPUPwYPx1adi8P9ukt2R8KkAYMJOb8nwNSkObW0nbeGL_uuJ-SJx_R-_rbaPl7m3VMiilBz0jKyT8X5Pvs_6Y6LBBVzCGMkYiA-rgQ5qvdlcc8R9FSEz1ccWeksCXovHgrC4ZoJYjPrL--ZqCOgajtkMA5xjVq_3DJ816v0gJ0I8t=s480"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This is so perfect, I did not regret stitching this together<br />(Says               Mina-chan who made the costume haha what)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh9hovkexRknIVLIwICMTl0vGoLjQHPW1-tGslSz8Q2gDrz3HuQBhbl2ulbVaUWngaeyo8E2wB1_ExBOZzExZj-EjO9I3UpDRHBC-lMSqdfMNrvUXyG5K8kpGaVksrEhI8KExrjuFmz7i6FMvGNUEU3Uw9f_XXU6C6DRdTnMe2yV0Hs0e_mVYYge4Y2=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Takagi is sooo enjoying herself right now I can't even             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdcRKWHRfFHMot6QDM6xnVPxeWaVMWs1SuZOTIdEaaWUZ9M37-_ba_37_OV2u0LfdQ3bLKFdLWZx8oce6Dj-1dRgGUO0hLjJUVz5vW8_w1DcyBSoa3I1jJ_7O5ezEU72vRQeJgqS_nky---DahVlIkd7PlOYN0WA7ZsOpp_ui17W9scu6WTOfTpLIo=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Gotta say though, this clutch save is what gets the girls in<br />(Also,               isn't her crotch facing the audience?

You ready, loners? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I know, me too, me too. But hey, have you ever   wondered, how you can look handsome, even if you didn't do anything? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Well, don't reference this series not every girl wants to be a cosplayer haha.   Anyways, you know what is more interesting than getting excited for cosplay?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Talking about story, of course, where we pick up the pieces Kitagawa   dropped of her affection of Gojou saying she's beautiful? Hey, I'll fall in   love with this guy too if I were her. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So, first half, we talk about   Kitagawa's sudden change of heart. Well, I mean, do you not anticipate that   though? It's in the title, please. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But you get the idea, yeah? But   personally I also wonder if Gojou meant what he said... as he dozes off on the   train so really, who knows right? But hey, it's not like Gojou won't be into   Kitagawa. I mean, he'll be into her once we- MOVING ON haha, the Gramps is   back home after two weeks of recovery... after discovering stockings brought   home by the grandson, got stunned again the second time after seeing a girl at   his shop, then actually found out the truth because why go the normal   visit-your-grandparent-at-the-hospital route when you can do it right at home?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Definitely not a "<a     href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40839/Kanojo_Okarishimasu"     target="_blank"     >KanoKari</a   >" Episode 1 reference lmao) And boy, did I enjoy every bit of Kitagawa   fangirling over one Gojou Wakana just because... technically he didn't say it   to her directly, but you know, you gotta go wild over it, right? It's high   school, man, you can go crazy as a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a>. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Not as much as her family history though, so we'll leave her and her cooking   at that for now lol. Next up, amongst all this wholesomeness I wish I can   enjoy more, but I guess we forgot this is a romance Anime so our new character   is here. Surprise surprise, it's a girl haha, and maybe Gramps letting her   into the shophouse was a mistake. Like, a HUGE mistake. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Apart from   not realizing that his dear grandson here doesn't have any friends apart from   the one future girlfriend hehe don't say I predicted that (lmao), it's   probably on Wakana's side to think that opening the door to the showers to   catch a potential scammer would be a good idea. Because... yeah, remember this   series has   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> references?   I thank animation studio Aniplex for doing God's work of NOT letting me watch   literal porno haha, but I think the flashback-enforced scene that was   witnessed by Gojou Wakana right here might be too detailed and ironically   hilarious he might as well surrender himself to the police on spying on a   naked girl in the bathroom. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I mean... <span title="*shrugs*">🤷</span> <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah,   surprise surprise x2, she's here for the outfits Wakana made, and of course   it's not of the hina dolls or else he would've gotten laid LONG ago haha sorry   bro, but also precisely because Wakana has seen the Nether universe lmao, he   is now blackmailed to make outfits for, wait for it, Kitagawa's favourite   cosplayer of all time. Yep, complicated now, isn't it? Probably not as much as   how new girl Inui Sajina a.k.a. Juju-san (I'll refer to her as Sajina, she has   a sibling and I need my thumbnail renames lmao) thought of the couple when she   stalked this rising popularity of a new cosplayer ever since the one outfit   got uploaded onto the World Wide Web, is here to ask the master to make an   outfit tailored to her figure. Yes, that petit, flat, totally not washboard   figure- *gets beaten up by Juju-san* Anyways haha, too much not Anime   references within an Anime to be honest I almost want to throw up at what was   this, a potential   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yuri" target="_blank">yuri</a> Anime series?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes, Gojou, its intended audience is for small girls. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in   all, I won't say much about the blackmail tbh since Kitagawa will find out   about that somehow and not like they can do anything about Gojou's crime   anyways lol, but now that we have some love triangle going on I can't wait to   see how many people want this guy to be doing cosplay outfits his whole life.   Hey, remember this series was about hina dolls? Not anymore! Haha I can see   all the relationship chart lines happening just like Blaze, so I think we'll   leave that to future episode where we see if Gojou can hold on to his   <strike>purity</strike>&nbsp;<strike>sanity</strike> virginity before his high   school graduation lmao Happy Valentine's Day btw haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; "I'm totally in love with Gojou-kun!"

I miss   emotional or softer songs. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, let's talk about them.   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/yowataribeta-no-aishikata/1604559147?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Kuso Iinkai's latest album</a     ></b   >  signalling their return is one in a while especially when it took them a month   to get from release date into music streaming, so I'm still glad I got to hear   more of them and miss what they are to like, because I really liked it. I   didn't give everything though, just a couple of songs as usual. What was   released this week though, ignoring yanaginagi's collaboration single which I   am not listening to, is   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88/1607058308?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Natsukawa Shiina's new album</a     ></b   >. Yeah, my dear   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>. The   whole album of new songs&nbsp; exclusive to this release is pretty intense   though as a whole, so I would say I gave almost half of the is it 9? Yeah, new   songs I've not heard of before including the   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/harenoba-take-over/1607058308?i=1607058310&amp;l=en"     target="_blank"     >topic song</a   >  of the album written by yours truly from UNISON SQUARE GARDEN Takushi Takuya   because I heard he was a guest in her late night radio show so I nailed his   name now haha, but yeah with Nan-chan's powerful singing it's hard to not   write songs that don't make you stand up and rock in high times. That's what I   felt from it though, and recently been burnt out giving such songs including   Anime theme songs so I wish I could hear something like Yukarisa from same   time last year, but I eventually got into it. So yeah, congrats on being the   new Collection Artist before Asakura Momo's new single in March which might   not even make her one. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> That's called simping, boys. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  On news concerning music and I've liked on Twitter so I can remember to   mention it here,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1491320967435481090"       target="_blank"       >Hanazawa Kana's new song</a     ></b   >  for her upcoming album literally brought me back to the 80s for some reason   lol "don't know why" (get it, because the song title), I definitely missed   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ORESKA_Official/status/1491256539491217410?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >ORESKABAND's rehearsal livestream</a     ></b   >  where I guess they tipped hints for their upcoming album, I did join in though   on   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1491366275267788803?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Natsukawa Shiina's new album release livestream</a     ></b   >  where she also announced her yearly "Shiina Day" event which I won't be going   just because,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1491336065126387713?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Aimer's 2nd song for THE FIRST TAKE on YouTube</a     ></b   >  has been   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1491424604489134085?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg"     target="_blank"     >on Twitter Trending</a   >  for that night in case you didn't notice and it's her new song the good one   (haha),   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1491740717789581314?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Sangatsu no Phantasia released live footage</a     ></b   >  of their live from last year with the face reveal of Mia-san by the way and   singing the love song from her previous album only makes that even better   (hehe),   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1491970270244098068?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new album tracklist</a     ></b   >  revealed collaborations with many artists so I hope that means it'll be good   lol, I rather skip listening to   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1492066956899667969?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >yanaginagi's selection album preview</a     ></b   >  just because I can do it again after I'm done with those three albums the week   after haha,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/miwastaff/status/1492079435545460743?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >miwa's new song</a     ></b   >  for her upcoming album isn't exactly awesome but I guess I'll get around to it   anyways,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1492340942975627267?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new video</a     ></b   >  on YouTube was from their previous livestream I missed and I think I'm only   liking this song more,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1492408206542663682?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Sambomaster's new song</a     ></b   >  is for a movie and will be released the week after but I'll get around to that   later lol #ThreeAlbumFebruary,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1492453427435036673?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >ClariS is releasing a new album in April</a     ></b   >  with a teaser after I lost count since even their previous song half a year   ago, And   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ohara_yuiko/status/1492449056031125504?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"       target="_blank"       >Ohara Yuiko's new song "la la la" version</a     ></b   >  is probably the cutest thing you'll hear all week. No really, just take a   listen, you'll get the gist even if you don't watch the Anime haha<br />  <br />So for next week, we got a week's break so the calm before the storm   which is next week with THREE ALBUMS Jesus Christ haha, but yeah, I do have   some things to listen to. Accidentally hit into another song from   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1492148691972784130?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"     target="_blank"     ><b>Cwondo</b></a   >, so I'll be giving the one by this week even. I also listened to   <b>wacci's new song</b> which is something for my emotional fix after all the   action this year, and since I did dig into one of the retweets from Nan-chan's   official artist Twitter crediting all   <a     href="https://twitter.com/SHITkojiro12250/status/1491354112314994696?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg"     target="_blank"     >the</a   >  <a     href="https://twitter.com/huyuyasumi_/status/1492087918655324160?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"     target="_blank"     >artists</a   >  <a     href="https://twitter.com/eba_cadode/status/1491390628923867145?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg"     target="_blank"     >who</a   >  <a     href="https://twitter.com/RON_SDF/status/1491308175727153156?s=20&amp;t=eSZ9dpxVXu-UJcnnu7poYg"     target="_blank"     >participated</a   >&nbsp;in creating her album (so that's links to one of the   producers/composers/lyricists of each of the 4 songs I gave in the album   hehe), I'll be listening to some   <a     href="https://twitter.com/huyuyasumi_/status/1485995102724104195?s=20&amp;t=Bacwsahe3FnT8SzFmAjarw"     target="_blank"     ><b>Sasagawa Nao</b></a   >  who did besides the lyrics because done by yours truly, for   <a     href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/super-dearly/1607058308?i=1607058334&amp;l=en"     target="_blank"     >one of the songs</a   >. Ironically I hit on her latest single which is (after some research reading   headlines and then understanding it is) a self-cover of a song she wrote for   an idol group but I guess I like her solo version more, so maybe I'll listen   to more from her. So yeah, the Alternative music fix I need next week to tune   myself back in order to give more mainstream stuff the week after I guess.   <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Look, you guys have no idea how much my roots are into Alternative   music okay? </div><div><br /></div><div>  Or maybe since I work on alternate days at home including tomorrow maybe I'll   watch a couple of live archives I have on hand for months and have no watched   them. We shall see.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />... </div><div>  <br />  Feeling lonely now, punk? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, it's tomorrow, and don't worry, as   long as you work from home and don't step out of the house tomorrow on a   Monday... let's just stay at home today on a Sunday too and play some DOAXVV   just in case haha <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Cya guys next time though, and until then... if   someone were to make me a Valentine I wish it was...<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. Oh well it's tomorrow but it's... whoever appears in that Wordle-like   quiz I made for myself haha so it can be anybody I'll update later hehe (Edit:   Hidaka Rina I guess! Though I'll argue Akarin probably I want to kiss my   desktop wallpaper from her fanclub I can't even) </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
