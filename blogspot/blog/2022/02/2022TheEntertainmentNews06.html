We got way more than I actually anticipated to grab in this smaller package so that's good news. Maybe I'll try to make it happen during my birthday week so I can make this the birthday gift for myself <span style="font-size: xx-small;"   >even though we know the actual gifts are the upcoming photobooks coming out   in March haha</span ><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I had a great week doing nothing related to work which no   doubt will only make me sad from here on because I see no public holidays   ahead of me besides when I have to spend two weeks in an army camp next month   but whatever haha, but yeah, NOW we are in 2022. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So hopefully, things   get better from here on. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> We can but hope haha oh well at least the   Anime is good lol I'm already spoiled for next season's shows but those can   wait we gotta clear these first<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan79">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "That's father's memories. He sure looks happy. For someone who casted his       previous family and friends to Hell, that is." Wow Zeke you don't have to       say that about your dad     </div>  </blockquote>  You know these two weeks is just going to be them explaining their life   stories right? The Jeager brothers? <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Well, might as well get this part   done and over with. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode where time is effectively   stopped until we know the truth because they don't pad this with filler   episodes lol (#AttackOnTitan79), we find out the true feelings behind these   two. Well, not like, romantically, this Anime has no such thing going on for   them unfortunately. And it seems, we have some mindf**k to go through here.   So, the memories of Grisha Jaeger, yes, that father who had a family, threw it   away and went to Eldia to have another. And that's how you have Zeke and Eren   respectively, by the way. Story goes that, in case you need a recap, Grisha   left his family in Marley which is occupied Eldian territory if you would   remember no one likes Eldians outside the walls, but he left because he would   find the Founding Titan power and potentially put a stop to that. Ironically   though, he had a family within the walls, and that's where the mistake began.   Yes, spoiler alert, Eren was right this whole time, because HE was the   mistake. Literally. We have some comparisons from where we knew of Zeke's   family to Eren's family, and interestingly in both cases, Grisha dealt with   them rather differently. The father told the truth to the first kid which   brought him to rebel against the Eldians, but he let the second kid go and   preferred to not tell him the truth outside of the walls. And that's where the   actual difference happens, because Zeke has always thought going against the   Eldians or removing them as a whole will save the world, when even back then,   Grisha's actions have been controlled by, you guessed it, Eren all along. How   though? As soon as Grisha found the basement where the Titans and royals   reside, he attempted to confront them if you would remember Freida was the   leader at that time, and in an attempt to do so, killed the whole royal family   apart from the King because he's technically useless in inheriting of the   Titan power. Besides, Grisha killed more kids than he has been a father of   so... I guess it's sin? Haha but yeah, truth is, because Grisha owned the   Attack Titan power (title drop lol) (please, I meant the Japanese title,   English title not accurate) and it looks like it has only been passed on   rather independently off the other powers which I assume the then royalty did   not have the powers to see into, that, in its own secret, that Titan actually   had the power to see the future. In context, that means Grisha has seen what   the world has been like even after he killed the royalty, to see this son rise   up to power, to see Eren join the Scouts and leave the walls... to this very   moment. So yeah, in case you didn't get this let me sum it up for you: The   father got screwed over by the kid. By Eren. Yeah, you got that right. <span title="*ugh*">üôÑ</span>   Zeke was obviously very thrown off by all this, thinking all the time that   Eren was brainwashed by the family to take revenge of what Eldians have   suffered, but turns out, might be better to destroy the world with Eldians and   their powers to reign over the universe, so to speak. Oh yeah, and destroy   Eren, why bother saving him lol. Will Zeke be able to stop this demon brother   in front of him though? I don't have high hopes on this so... good luck Zeke!   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, very informative episode by the way we have waited 78   episodes for this precise moment lol, but yeah now that the truth is out and   the two have to fight it out without a conclusion so literally they have to   agree on a conclusion to this somehow... I see an Annie Titan appearance so we   might have further history to dig into. As I said, we're not yet done, so   let's see how far we need to go to know what action to take next. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> I   feel bad for Zeke now haha that poor dude and everyone being controlled by   Eren including Yelena by the way shoutout to that guy haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; This is not just a prediction by the way, but what if I told you the   title of this series is also the reason why it was created to put an end to   all this? Yeah, I mean, the Attack Titan was created to end all Titans. Think   about it. I had my suspicions since the 3rd season where they left for Marley   but now that I've seen a glimpse of it] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhc_pNMGKp5UqOGCLDu9CtHWHQ75WSgPNAe4zdqEA91cp8lgywLU735t-H4ZevGu4XT_7ISlz24nyumbx-e3aEjqAfQeLXGS-gHtD3kwdETGtU0W_U_wPw_4WDvJitTGHWq5NsUpvfLhOtkX8z79pxXOMJBIgOeWiRIPlWIbqXCSN66vT7cFoVc4U5t=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me leaving the house as a stupid teenager lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi1lLsT2hsBDP5Bw7wAqy-iUuUqXgXn7k0YrX5yg24R-Ist5Cmhb5RtnnQfb2Bo0Z0PDvJouN8J0GK9AJpd7m4542xmnjYcdqnb0ugTF9Rbd8yP8yGfqmaxokhlIwu3kXpM327u9RvkCN4IVMJIXEkzsjge62dz8zybCURUgAO4Cv3cxbN_LLvyph-R=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me leaving the house as a disappointed parent lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. "I can carry out the euthanization plan at any time. But I will never   abandon you (Eren)" But why, just let me die already Zeke, geez.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>&nbsp; </div><div>  P.P.S. "I want to know what the outside world is like!" Well, you don't want   to know. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Why, even in this world, must it be ruled by politics? Haha   get it, because politics is based on rule and power<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS305">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "It's precisely because he likes you that's why he teases you" Haha never       thought I'll ever hear this but okay     </div>  </blockquote>  Wow what was with that introduction- Ah hey, don't you wish THIS was the   actual Anime though? Where the dude was the teaser? No? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Sorry, female   audience, I know you all enjoy Nishikata embarrassment but in this new episode   (#TakagiSanS305) and I hope you have watched the episode by now, that...   that's the kid???? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah yes, the future references again, in case you   forgot this series had a spin-off talking about Takagi and Nishikata... being   parents already haha okay let's come back to parent's tales please. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   Ignoring that intro because seriously if you are still wondering how this   series is going to conclude or is ever haha, we talk more about stuff we don't   like, quoting from the future it seems. For even if the kid doesn't like green   peppers, so does the father Nishikata it seems, and don't ask me how Takagi   knows about it I swear there's a hidden camera in the poor guy's bag haha, but   yeah, guessing Takagi's dislike didn't go well so I'm not going to think much   about it. We can live without energy drinks but vegetables... ask me how my   body's doing rejecting greens for two decades lmao spoiler alert it's not   great. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, I assume Takagi is not a picky eater like Yukari and   more like Mina-chan she just eats everything, so maybe exchanging   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyoza" target="_blank">gyoza</a> for carrots   is not a bad thing at all... until some middle person cut in on the deal. And   that is how Sanae hardly ever feels remorse out of eating her friend's lunch   box lol, but she did make the trade even bigger by getting something from the   canteen and exchanging for all of the fried dumpling because why not. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   Next up, what to do for the school festival. Well, it seems like "fried   chicken cafe" isn't going to win by any means lol shoutout to Kimura for   proposing that dumb idea haha we need like a eating contest if we were to do   this though lmao, looks like the class is going for a play. Yukari wrote the   script so I'm not even surprised that it's about a live story between an ugly   prince and a beautiful princess so cringe it'll get her nosebleed lol, the   trio chose Takagi as the princess, but they had to audition the prince. And   this is where the actual showdown is, right? I mean, it makes sense, because   apart from the obvious hints in the plot where the play was dramatically   presented to the class featuring Takao as evil witch lol, we already know who   fits each role perfectly so I'm not too surprised Sanae ended up choosing   Kimura as the prince since the image is portraying someone more of his size   anyways. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay I promise not to bully on the obese again Nishikata   isn't even physically fit for the role lol okay I'm sorry. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But   really, the teacher having it easy though, having all this planned and done   for him, easy life as teacher lol. Last but not least, and this is why you   should watch this episode and pretty much every episode in this third season   coming, it's fishing time! I mean, it's deliberate fishing time planned by   yours truly Nishikata for some reason so yeah you can call this a fishing   date, and Takagi decided to join in for the ride. Not like she has learned how   to fish before, but I feel like if I give her the fish she'll also know how to   cook it so... I guess she wins either way. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Anyways, 5 small fish or   1 big fish for the win, Nishikata got hook on the big one and almost got   pulled into the river until... well we saw that in the season preview trailer,   Takagi grabbed him from behind. Like, not even just a tug, it's a full on hug,   man. Even God himself would be jealous. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Yeah, dude, this must be   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/koi" target="_blank">love</a>... for   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/carp" target="_blank">fish</a> haha yes I   got that joke alright. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, as Nishikata's voice actor   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KAJI__OFFICIAL/status/1489647332107128834?s=20&amp;t=Mc8QRe2u1_hSZsX6LyDpVA"     target="_blank"     >Kaji Yuki said it right</a   >: #DamnYouTakagiSan #DamnYouPreviousTakagiSan #DamnYouPresentDayNishikata lol   this episode is just too much for the weak of heart. Again, like, just as a   reminder every episode from here on, we are on romance rollercoaster territory   now, so yeah, expect a lot more of whether it's accidental or not, lovey-dovey   stuff like this probably from Takagi-san's side going forward. Oh boy, why am   I even watching "KiseKoi" I can just die from this haha cya guys again next   time </div><div>[TL:DR; "Why does she know?"

I know, it's   not the web series where that dude is still making the outfit I just want to   see Suguta Hina cosplay instead lmao okay me, but yeah, I guess we going to   the cosplay event after all. So, story. Can't believe we've reached Episode 12   this early but <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Yeah, as you can imagine, this is the title theme part   of the series reaching a conclusion. The love part... let's just leave that   for later. So, I can't really be as hyped as <strike>Shizuku</strike> Kitagawa   herself, but yeah I think within the premises of the reveal she did exhibit   enough excitement and hype of the outfit I think it definitely compensated for   whatever sh*t Gojou went through just for this very girl. Yeah. And so, they   went to the cosplay event as unplanned. I mean, how else you gonna reward your   most efficient worker, right? But really, that's the whole point of cosplay   anyways, and thus, they venture out to their very first photoshoot in the   event. Apart from seeing Kitagawa sweat like a dog as we will find out later   apart from the summer heat (HELL YEAH lol), we see a lot of things that will   of course happen if you have been to an otaku event featuring a cosplay panel.   In general, we see either people who want some photos whether it's   professional photographers like   <a     href="https://twitter.com/pshuka_niconico/status/1484657298639581185?s=20&amp;t=rZX_iGi4xbPFNjeavU_2pA"     target="_blank"     >this dude</a   >&nbsp;(yes intentional promotion of futon-chan you're welcome) or just   someone who participated in the event and was impressed by someone dressed up   as their favourite porn game character... haha you get the idea, but we also   witnessed the downsides of doing such things, such as not making a more   breathable outfit (HELL YEAH lol I mean in fabric dude) so Kitagawa be   sweating out of the suit under the hot sun in less than an hour just because.   I guess this is also Gojou's fault at hand, but then again they just   haphazardly went for it so I can't imagine it'll help much also when Kitagawa   brought in more paddings for her chest to look more like the character- Tell   me this will happen in the web series too. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Jokes aside, which is why   cosplayers take a lot more care and attention into these kinds of things, take   regular breaks to wipe up and hydrate themselves... so you know, it's not a   simple thing to do here, dressing up as who they like. Just, you know, not all   of them have like, a manager-like role boyfriend who can wipe up their backs   as and when they want to in a stairway lol ah hey. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I'll ignore that   part for now to be honest you can witness that marvel for yourself I won't   even consider this borderline illegal but it's definitely far from the legal   territory already in terms of the drawings. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> On the way home since   they chose to retire early due to lack of planning which is kind of Kitagawa I   guess but with experience she will learn to not bring more padding next time   lmao, the couple thanked each other on the return train for an experience they   will never forget haha I think someone got it off more than the other HELL   YEAH lol, and Kitagawa hinted on doing more outfits with her dedicated   tailor... until she gets popular on the Internet and finds someone else more   professional to do the job. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah hey, Gojou did say the thing, so it   blew my mind as much as Kitagawa did. She is beautiful though Gojou, I'll give   you that she's half the reason I'm watching this series. <span title="*thumbs up*">üëç</span> All in   all, yep, this concludes the cosplay part of this series, and FINALLY, we be   jumping right into the romance part of this series. Like seriously, cosplay is   just for appetizers. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> No really, who on Earth is interested in (no   offense to cosplayers but) the costumes of some porno game when you start to   realize they make of a great couple? Eh? Come on, Kitagawa, I need your shame   to hit the roof before we bring more than 2 paddings to a Shizuku-tan cosplay   haha gonna love that part when that comes in on full force hehe see you guys   there soon </div><div>  [TL:DR; "I have at least fifty favourite characters!"

NOW the package coming   in will be a good time I'll have more time for it and not having it wasted on   transit. We shall meet until that happens hopefully leading up to my birthday   so... so far so good, this year. Bye. </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S.   <a     href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZouSSWFA8y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"     target="_blank"     >Touyama Nao just walked in with an Instagram live</a   >  just now which is likely meant to promote the upcoming... book? It's not   exactly a photobook and like the previous time we reviewed one, this was for   her 5 years as a solo artist so... I need more info to seal the deal haha   which I will likely buy with Lynn's photobook but no competition, no. Naobou   is just too cute and Lynn-san is in two bikini outfits so yeah. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Maybe   compare Ede-chan with her instead will be fairer I just worry about the amount   of text on the book itself so I need more info... apart from her saying that   friends and family (literally) interviews were in the book. You know I don't   read those lol we shall see if my fingers get itchy haha </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.P.S. Also shoutout to those who are directly or indirectly affected by the   pandemic out there so Sumipe I think you are fine you posting on Instagram   already but Moeshi seems to be infected so I hope she will be fine soon tbh I   need more of your panting but not due to a virus lmao <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
