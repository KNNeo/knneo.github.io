Please, my   average episodes to watch per week per series is one. I watch every week.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But that might change soon, I gotta watch "Romantic Killer"   someday...<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BLEACHTYBW11">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I know the whereabouts of every Asauchi I've created" Holy sh*t is this       ye olde GPS? Haha spiritual energy dude, it's better than satellite     </div>  </blockquote>  You think Ichigo understand whatever the f**k Namaiya, THE zanpakuto creator,   is talking about all this time? He don't, right? He's not   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a> in   nature too. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> No really, in these final episodes of the first cour of the   final arc (#BLEACHTYBW11), let's talk about where Ichigo's soul stands at.   With Zangetsu...? Haha ah hey long time joke already, let's be serious. I   guess I should talk about each episode at length, huh. Well, not long, I don't   want to type so much here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Story goes that Ichigo was brought back to   his hometown lol you can figure that out yourself, and sees his father in   shinigami outfit. So yeah, he will tell us the story. Of him, being a family   of Shiba clan. Being a captain, so many years ago. So surprise, Ichigo is   basically Quincy in nature but we shall not elaborate just yet, but yeah, if   you think Matsumoto with shorter hair and even shorter Hitsugaya in the 10th   Squad of the Gotei 13 is stupid, think again. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Because someone is   making even more noise in the Real World specifically Karakura Town, and even   less of a surprise there, we are talking about events roughly after when   Urahara escaped Soul Society a century ago in the timeline, and before Aizen   decided to pin himself on the wall. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, that. Firstly, we talk   about the confrontation. Not with Aizen and the gang, but kinda. Let's. If I   didn't remember wrongly it was about 80 years ago in the time, Mayuri   succeeded me as captain of the 12th Squad <span title="*wink*">😉</span> personal fan lore, after some   events in the Real World with shinigami killed it happened again soon after in   repetition, so Isshin was sick of waiting in line and decided to investigate   this by himself even though apparently it was 13th Squad's job at the time.   What he saw though, was basically an Arrancar prototype because it got Hollow   powers from a deceased(?) shinigami (Can you die <i>and </i>die again? I mean,   ask the guy whom Zaraki took the sword from lol) so Hollow but acted in the   form of a shinigami, so Arrancar basically. That term was probably not coined   back then, so "White", I guess. Hey, I'm not being racist, Aizen is. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, Isshin was supposed to deal with it well, but this time around, maybe   also because Aizen knew that this prototype wasn't making much progress in   order for them to draw better conclusion to the evolution of their "research",   he decided to intervene. So I guess Isshin doesn't know the betrayal thing   yet. Yeah, only Urahara and that bunch knew, I suppose. Thankfully, Masaki ran   out of her... fostered shelter lol that's the nicest way to say that because   Ryuuken can't even do shit haha yes that's Ishida's dad by the way he looks so   young, to you know, take action. It went surprisingly well just by baiting the   enemy to her side and shooting a spiritual arrow down its neck, almost blew up   in an explosion if not for Isshin helping out... so I guess they win.   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But what is up next, is what will seal the deal for the backstory of   Ichigo's family.</div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi94v7HZ7J9ReUOxN1AF2aiuR5WUbpFlMX9ZPvNJgeYUJdTUOrtS71JQYco21gdj7QofgA-P6D0mZWD-D36cm2GFaqHpfDpB4M4bf4j66kOEriuKjmj2Kofxfr0jQ-ug5AkttPA4B_15v_hmJSxAB8zuLMCTBzwWS3vipgkCg-yZNEWGs_NGVzbYPXy/s320/bleachTYBW11_couple.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is where it all started, people.<br />A love story of all time             haha           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOLqYjON4VmUQmD_IqDff6SMm7yVw2Cmint2O_5mSuAO7qEXiigNU3ZPsiziQenN7-K1Cdvtb5OM6y4xUEvNPcC_PRmt0cC1VaceNNUdWq8guqo10mZfrqHXJ6AAVSjrImgj55WOo3H-wbfVNrktV58kuwd-KSFFuHzhQvEyeJc75GgRkX-U74AssC/s320/bleachTYBW11_shiba2.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW my friends get the sex jokes I say lol           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnXdhDWxyGIHQ7W6KN9N3hYWfipCQuB85TQNEBgCBelGMaj_CQ8b9P4dPp5ly3VuQ_PL_Mnwk9QMrJsw3Z0XodptWNgwMwTuhkOnVkppraPhlz5zDwmkKX3JYxS7PhIe6Xb8KoNpKRPua_AG7txyAtgybnS9xyh657eCSsiDVCl14EbTjIGEBZdR8L/s1600/bleachTYBW11_shooting.gif" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            This is real impressive though, considering she is a Quincy of             Ishida Uryu's age           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  <div></div>  <div><blockquote style="text-align: center;">"Do you think she (Masaki) will be happy marrying me?" Of course not       Ryuuken you f**k even a dead soul is more capable of marrying her-       Oops even I was more capable haha     </blockquote>    </div></div><div>So days later, after Isshin went back and reported... pretty much everything   that happened and I swear three people already knew it in the Hall lmao   <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, this part (#BLEACHTYBW12) talked about Masaki's condition after that   fight. In summary? Not great. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, not great if you are Ryuuken   because damn freaking Katagiri opened her damn mouth when she found out that a   Hollow hole appeared on a Quincy, probably went to tell on the Aunt of the   household who shouldn't be knowing of this so... but yeah, I guess in order to   receive treatment, even though at this point you think anyone Quincy will   treat her? Haha damn, I mean, we're nice enough to keep her till high school,   dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ryuuken thought of getting his father to help her out but he's   out we never saw the old man again anyways so whatever lol, but he did see   Isshin who intended to go back to the Real World once again to thank the girl   who saved his soul. Well, only to find out that she is about to die, and   arguing with another Quincy who he doesn't even know who, and THEN dealing   with another dude who tells them we can't get Masaki back as a (pure) Quincy   and just to save her life? Man, this is a lot to think about let us sit down   with some tea, please. But of course not, we don't have time to brainstorm   like Ryuuken, and only after listening to the expert right here - well, the   only expert - did Isshin immediately agree to the terms: binding his soul   inside a human body to counteract the Hollow Quincy inside Masaki, something   that would already kill her anyways if we wait any longer. Also, if they did   not stop Masaki's Hollowfication, Aizen would have been SO happy, he's gonna   be me when I jack off- Anyways haha he didn't and so is my sad single life   lol, but heck, on that very day a bond is formed. Sorry, Ryuuken, you can go   bang Katagiri or something lmao, but congratulations on Shiba Isshin with the   quick snatch on Kurosaki Masaki and telling us his love story... he threw away   his family name too lest he got found out by probably Kuukaku but I think she   already knew who her brother is like, and they now have to be together for all   of eternity. Well, almost. Because remember the mother died? Yeah, she didn't   die because she can't fight a Hollow. She was just an impure Quincy, she can   fight with a bow and have something to defend herself, even if you didn't know   about the Blut Vene thing. But no, that was also the day Yhwach awakened his   powers. Nine years ago. Welp. I'm not going to name that godly power of his,   but if you understand that his blood runs with all Quincy... So, in case you   wonder how this all links to Ichigo, as my dear Urahara Kisuke has mentioned,   this will be passed down for generations. Therefore Ichigo. I mean, it can be   Karin-chan too but this is not the point. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, the Hollow, the Quincy   blood thing even though Ichigo is even less pure than the mom at this point,   the shinigami powers from the father easily drawn out from some training from   Urahara who KNEW of his position as a human soul jack of all trades... You get   the idea now. He HAS to be the main character-</div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2H1SjQNCDIeO5AwZv7aHE-28e4V_4ai_reH_N2Bw8e_qFMQ9I-2MBWopVZPbpmh7wkbkJHwB3sU-gupfUTLS5VIeoKzQITq2ldDO8PTHxu3coIgeAZEt5sqYYP8AlWZYvdsZYz2KEjs13M4yh6B9zukmp7l0PwyGlJXlKCpEY10A16FQVjIsKih2U/s320/bleachTYBW12_gigai.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Me in a corner at parties lol           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeVArwtz0vZVCTA64c1c7VlhoBzojBgdhRm4Br-lPKxCzjQpAipJZv0XS6x6yXShQ3mdXyTlJ6mCqkM4PDd3hTV6bqE7xe7BW4YVYACubNioiWfzxrJPQIwXEw0BJ3OlITQ-n-zUmRv77QGHAOykONz59oa2EXVeNJ1Hou8dnJg8mJFsLv_FzvRA67/s320/bleachTYBW12_hole.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Aw man her hole is open IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'<br />(lol)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl3PnQp3UWW-IAXHgDfDy40mrmQyg8V2tUpfBUHukXNJDZi-wWAt_qkbFYgknyK8fgUsnZL2SNdl7DrnHepxqQ7ltMBhqK4AOsZBTlBlCz9jjg3sov9Phm-DR7J1ixRzo4_bAtYocK63CfR2R6UDkmgrgpha5tg-ky2a7QqTuSOjWm4BnHTUjqz2BQ/s320/bleachTYBW12_yay.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            MFW I write shit code, show it to the user and it works<br />(Yay)             (Haha)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  <blockquote style="text-align: center;">"... there's a possibility that the Ishida family's bloodline could become     tainted!" Yeah, this is a thing. Also, Masaki WAS bit by a Hollow so....   </blockquote></div><div>And to end this season, for the final episode (#BLEACHTYBW13) I guess we are   making Ichigo's zanpakuto now. Hey, the Asauchi now kinda looks like the   Quincy army, right? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Don't deja vu too much, guys, we got story to   tell. Well, let's save the best for last, so let's talk about what is in   Seireitei now. Well, considering some of them got their Bankai stolen, I can't   imagine the likes of Hitsugaya and Soifon being able to do anything at this   point apart from... honing their other skills? I mean, Soifon still has her   assassination and/or Shunko powers she learnt from the 2nd Squad thing (Edit:   Oh yeah Onmitsukidou), but Hitsugaya?? He's pretty much done, dude, if he   can't get his sword back. Ironic, isn't it? Like, isn't there anything in the   shinigami's blood- Oops, too much deja vu. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But for Komamura though,   he has a different story. Considering he isn't a human soul in the first   place, and he's under some animal clan or something haha hey guys let's not   get into furry territory that fast, but yeah, he desired to get back the   clan's power to compensate for his lack of sword power. Makes sense, but I   guess the old dog won't agree to this that easily, so he has to deal with it   first. I mean, this old thing is more stubborn than my grandfather who is   already dead by the time I was born so you tell me. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Moving on lol,   Mayuri is doing something real secret and evil which will be revealed soon but   suffice it to say he is once again illegally modifying his Bankai to no end   but not like he hasn't done that before his sword changed shape so much   Namaiya might be confused to see his soul now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hisagi is forced to   draw his Bankai out which he did I don't have to do spoiler alert for this   because HE NEVER RELEASED IT ANYWAYS also it is not that convenient as with   many others you can find out in novel series co-written by another author   under Kubo-sensei's supervision <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, and I guess we can talk about Ichigo's   zanpakuto now. For starters, it's not Zangetsu. Well, the name, as provided   from the "sword" itself. That's not real. Now that we have gone through the   whole thing about how much of a rojak Ichigo was made to be even as a human   lol Southeast Asia joke, one should understand how this works now. So   basically, Ichigo's soul is comprised of many things. The Quincy power, for   starters. He is born from Masaki who is a Quincy so that makes sense, he   hardly is a shinigami to begin with. Then, there's the Hollow. According to   the dad, he got back his powers because the bond to hold back Masaki's   Hollowfication is broken due to Ichigo doing all the save the world stuff lol,   so in a nutshell a Hollow sits within him. Why didn't it die with the mother I   wouldn't know, but let's just say it didn't. Passed down for generations,   remember? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, those two, and Ichigo doesn't have shinigami   powers to begin with. He doesn't even know the four fields of shinigami   excellence which I till try to recall right now with a hint from Hitsugaya....   Zanjustsu haha that's swordsmanship ie. when you have your blade lmao, Hohou   which is movement so the reason why Byakuya can move so fast and I'm not   talking about now he's still half dead, Hakuda which is hand-to-hand combat   which is exhibited by literally no one apart from old geezer Yamamoto (RIP)   because if you ran out of techniques and had to use this you're a monster   haha, and Kido, what fictional me would've excelled in. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Ichigo   knows... maybe the first one lol not even he doesn't even know how to swing   his sword- Heck, even Zaraki took a lesson in Kendo, dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Long story   short, the sword was remade using the two souls - Ichigo's soul of Quincy   descent, and the Hollow - in a very occult situation probably Namaiya has   never faced before, but it was a success. And that's how he gets two swords   without a new name, and had to say goodbye to the souls he was mistaken of all   these years. From the moment we saw Zangetsu, he was just the Quincy power all   along. And maybe the Hollow's if it can't suppress it sometimes as with   Grimmjow or Ulquiorra or Byakuya... that's all. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So now you know. All   in all from the above dude... I still CANNOT BELIEVE I have to wait half a   year for the next cour of this final to appear. Again it's like "Attack on   Titan", but less painful to wait haha it's the same this one had deeper   connection to me, and I can't WAIT to see it&nbsp; happen. We are teased with   a trailer revealing the beating up we will have to witness until Ichigo can   come down from the Reioukyuu so this will be fun.

So see you then, if you need a   song reference I will recommend you something from Japan if you don't mind.   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Bye! </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. Because I was lazy to write an actual spec script for an animation movie   I intended to do about my own lore for "BLEACH" when I was a student lol, I   shall put in point form, where I lie in the history of Soul Society: </div><div>  <ul style="text-align: left;">    <li>      Soon after the betrayal of Urahara Kisuke, Shihouin Yoruichi and Tsubasaki       Tessai and the missing of many captains in Gotei 13 about 100 years ago,       Seireitei hastily decided to reform the leaders of Soul Society, namely       promoting members of the Squads. For the 12th Squad though, Central 46 was       hesitant in allowing the promotion of then Vice Captain Kusotsuchi Mayuri       due to his history in prison, thus 3rd Seat Officer Aozaki Shouhei was       placed as replacement Captain.     </li>    <li>      Throughout the 5 or so years in reign, Shouhei continued to develop       technologies in a very different direction compared to Mayuri, who seeked       more occult means of work compared to Shouhei's more practical approaches       to improving combat, leading of the widespread use of Kido as one of the       four forms of shinigami combat being his vision, and creating training       grounds and research facilities powered by Kido so shinigami can train       better overall. Most notably, he was able to create a controlled       environment to the extent where power-driven 11th Squad members can       train their released zanpakuto in.     </li>    <li>      Rumours started to rise within the 12th Squad about Mayuri's doubt on       Shouhei's abilities as Captain and Technological Institute Head, not       following the vision of technological advancement into souls and moreover       prohibiting the experiments Mayuri was doing. In protest, Mayuri       discovered that Shouhei has been in close contact with now in Real World       Urahara Kisuke, and has been yearning to leave Soul Society to join his       master outside of control.     </li>    <li>      The day finally arrived when Shouhei was spotted ready to escape using       Mayuri's technologies, though bested by Mayuri's inventions with enough evidence to get him executed, Shouhei fought his way out even revealing       his long-trained Bankai on a disadvantage against Mayuri's poison blade.       Seireitei was kept mum about the issue especially from Mayuri as this       would give him free reign over the rule of the Squad and Institute, in       which he eventually obtained.     </li>    <li>      Shouhei in the Real World used a self-made gigai and spent time in hiding       before eventually settling down on opening a dojo, where he continued to       hone his sword skills since he can't use his spiritual energy. He       eventually was able to use all his shinigami power and train a squad       of 5 human-shinigami hybrids in the Real World, with Asauchi stolen from       Seireitei itself.     </li>  </ul>  <div>    Call this a <i>special </i>special episode then, you're welcome. Also, if     anyone wanted to animate this I would LOVE to voice Aozaki Shouhei myself,     thanks. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
