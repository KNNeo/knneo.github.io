No later though; I have   Anime to watch in the weekend lmao </div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, this isn't a new new single, but talking about old we cannot be older   than Ajikan here so... well they started when I was like, 4? So <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> This   single is also a regret just like RyokuShaka in which I could've reviewed it   last year- Man, what is with me judging songs in 2021 </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span       class="head-prefix"       ><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span     ><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION - Empathy [Single]   </div></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <table     align="center"     cellpadding="0"     cellspacing="3"     class="tr-caption-container"     style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"   >    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <img             border="0"             data-original-height="496"             data-original-width="500"             height="317"             src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/16/KSCL-3306.jpg?v=2"             width="320"           />        </td>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <img             border="0"             data-original-height="496"             data-original-width="500"             height="317"             src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/18/KSCL-3308.jpg?v=2"             width="320"           />        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table>  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div><div>  (Welcome to the most exciting spot the difference contest! Jokes aside though,   this quirky over-detailed art style is by Nakamura Yuusuke as with almost all   of their releases)<br /><br /></div><div>  Origin: And I have no idea where to start for this long time Klassic Note   Collection Artist. Thanks to an Anime titled "BLEACH" which many probably   started on, they have quickly solidified their position in my heart busting   out Rock songs where my teenage days are with its mood swings, and they   immediately appealed to me. Fast forward to so many years later, we have   personally seen them change from their mellow style to slightly more lively,   from more inspired by English themes and song titles to vocalist Masafumi   Gotoh going solo with "Gotch" and other members forming new groups of   different genres... this band has come a long way. And that is still not doing   them justice to show how great they are. This release coincided with their   25th anniversary, it was a heavy credit to the recent Anime "Boku no Hero   Academia" movie which I did not pay attention to in 2021, but now that I have   come around to it with the new album release, I am reminded of how this   represents who they are today. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Empathy</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Going through the days with a twisted form   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Overcoming the sea of asphalt</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Upon the horizon (we) can see freedom though   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Facing it and shouting at the world</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">As always"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>  When I listened to this song, it really reminded me of good old "Ajikan" as   fans call them. When they started in the late 90s, emo and alternative Rock is   a trend especially in Japan, and they are easily identified with their slow   build-up in verses to the more impactful choruses and easy listening melodies   overall. These easily attributed to how they sound and even produce their   music today, and the vocals only make it more depressing especially if their   songs take a turn. Fortunately, this has a rather hopeful and happy mood for   an Anime movie theme song, maybe too positive for their image, but it is   nonetheless a typical song of their trade. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <iframe     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTdxvatMig4"     title="YouTube video player"   ></iframe></div><div>Rating: Average</div><div><br /></div><div>(2) Flowers</div><div>From the first/last chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">"Ah</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Hearing the bells ring</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    See, it isn't the end it's just the beginning   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Even if (one) forgets about (it) cleanly   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Still, somewhere (I am) still smiling"</div></blockquote><div></div><div>  Ah, this is the other side of Ajikan, as I often mention about bands having a   second image. With a lively mood these Rock bands tend to have, I'm surprised   to hear of them having cultivated such a mood when it comes to emotional   songs, and this is very titular of their emo feels. With a long song length   building up to represent the slow mood yet carry the essence of the emotion   within, to extending the song through instrumentals that will sit you into   feeling the song more than listening to the lyrics, this is truly what I   admired of them even listening to their old tracks from best albums all these   years despite never going through their full music library. Still, the lyrics   talk about what sounded like the cycle of life and departure, and I am trying   not to cry upon it. I mean, can you not? This is still too cool to tear up too   though, I will say that much.&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhqFprpPddI"     title="YouTube video player"   ></iframe></div><div>Rating:&nbsp;Above Average</div><div><br /></div><div>  (3) Furetai Tashikametai (Seiho Mix) [I Want To Touch You And Be Sure] </div><div>  As you can see in the title, it's a remix. Essentially the vocal tracks are   passed to a song producer who in typical cases change drastically the style   and instruments behind the original melody which was released in a single back   in 2020. So, if you listen to the original song, you will know that I prefer   that version, and if I were to talk about that one, then I will say it is a   good song. For this though? I am not going to comment about as I generally   give songs including mixes based on songs I have given. Specifically for this   though, I wouldn't have given it if I heard of this, honestly. The original is   good mainly because it has an easy chorus to listen to, and it features guest   vocalist Shiotsuka Moeka which gives a duo singing feel to it and is really   chill in mood despite it being a love song talking about physical contact. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe     allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"     allowfullscreen=""     frameborder="0"     src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2697CdDWSM"     title="YouTube video player"   ></iframe></div><div>Rating: (Not this remix, the original song) Above Average</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: If you have adored the likes of emo and alternative Rock listening   to Japanese music all these years, I wonder why you have not stumbled upon   them yet. But if you had, you will understand the feels coming out of this   single for their 25-year long journey into creating music. That, you will have   learnt of its best and worst to know that this is just one of those things you   will remember forever. This impact, will be enough for me to come back to for   years to come. Also, if you like some of those long songs with a mellow mood,   Ajikan has a lot of those to tide you through, and I speak from experience. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img     border="0"     data-original-height="3024"     data-original-width="3024"     height="320"     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKVFvxHIR9xIaHLeo_qyARyPt5CqX8iCt87ePkl48naXwcbazNdzw_aHXLPhx-hqpk3UIN6lJdyhlYWFFZrccptWvRWGdwjSUMLnpiwvR0k1Rg8XQ-iHHT4uj7z3hLSo6-fYwxBVHJAg-p2qyqTQqXyafiZANe9jPqN7N6u-fay9ETBFc-Bf0a9PbA/s320/PXL_20220421_122252659.jpg"     width="320"   /></div><div><br /></div><div>  (And if you wonder how Track 3 had such a perfect English translation, you   should've seen this literally written on the CD booklet. Also, I didn't talk   about the music video(s) anyways because you don't look at Ajikan, you listen   to their feels. That is what music is about anyways imo) </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img     border="0"     data-original-height="4032"     data-original-width="3024"     height="320"     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIj8sTLch0wWCJmoMymOx-AxqExktLQ8WfFFS2R4cB97Hn7DKBni8pIOn5WZ6k8X2N4fbpNb54pXPT04LpLMUnWktVVErsSU_LNnjyn_07kSq-eQNtQPrrGufco9oKKG7KZY0cXttRQ8H03k1cnUhxtI5-TvkLxkNhfWBsOpkJ89XnO5B2l5L_OJUC/w240-h320/PXL_20220421_122209466.jpg"     width="240"   /></div><div>  Ah, this is worth talking about despite being like, uh, half a year late   already at this point? Haha ah hey, never too late, yes? It's not two years   like Ten-chan's single we reviewed early this year or even Ajikan's single   from 2009- Damn that's a long time ago haha about a decade after it released   then I reviewed that CD thanks to... one of their many best albums lol </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img     border="0"     data-original-height="4032"     data-original-width="3024"     height="320"     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrn_C2ITpLXucppmzIUwrAcedC0Csf8NdDNsENjgJSvpqg-24aP4xw2qsE0iSGmPD0TVg6S-YYt_mPrEy_KPsU6IildlI_ArNTuJuCsm6kf22sSuhEIGKiWBMv3rU1mxCM5VYWpusjUwq7uvU3TRzH7Aux-Im8Ikw41ODdMj7E-7jDYHE2-zAsKiQX/s320/PXL_20220421_122343338.jpg"     width="240"   /></div><div>  Nothing much inside the package, this is your usual standard CD release so   don't expect idol-artist level decorations inside of the release. Again,   shoutout to   <a href="https://twitter.com/kazekissa" target="_blank">Nakamura Yuusuke</a>  for the awesome cover as usual this guy is a regular at their release covers   if you need reference go to their discography haha (And Anime "Youjouhan   Shinwa Taikei" because this guy is the character designer for that FYI lol   when you do illustrations long enough to reach that level dude) (Aww man the   sequel is just a movie not a TV series? Haha ok me), and looks like they have   adopted a bird as their symbol in recent years. Yeah, didn't figure out what   that meant so </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img     border="0"     data-original-height="4032"     data-original-width="3024"     height="320"     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilJGpAxQ7mBaMZ3PavcuCrfS78yN27RyH5aVCsMCBnS0MCMsk_NF4s7FFhT4QtL_LU0Gpx6KnC89tBMMNDZzhR_jLzUsnI4aTW5kUDiEPaLhTZh3oXFeZrloFHekQicPC9V3tyG9jiUrR77zB4zYRTvEqkv3EH6ygUnVhKedm1C8oiOpm_f7hxUUE7/s320/PXL_20220420_131052675.jpg"     width="240"   /></div><div>  Along with the release, and that is why it did not come with any major package   similar to SHE'S, it came from CDJapan which listed a special gift of an   anniversary sticker set, which I assume is probably the least appealing of the   online stores considering we are half a year late, but I'll take anything at   this point. Probably not going to use those stickers though, I highly doubt   it'll withstand the amount of water it takes to wash my bottle that I'm going   to paste them on haha </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  That will be all, ladies and gentlemen! What is up next is whatever you would   not believe it because I still don't too after making the purchase yesterday,   likely next month we will be reviewing Itou Miku's new single! Yay, ma bro   would be proud. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yeah anyways we will talk about how that happened   even lol, and how I might be taking her impression as with Ueda Reina we have   discovered in recent years. See you all then. Or when the upcoming major   package where I finally can review two more photobooks and say I go to school   despite it being a fanclub lol bye </div><div><br /></div><div>TL:DR;</div><table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="3024"           data-original-width="4032"           height="240"           src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh12l_JVBir8_OMA_YdVg_FMqK3y9OerUKMAsYtbD0uijtu_oOMwPUOQH-L0SQtJM3x3ryGRU03enafmtXrOrn-rqDi0JK-P-kuvhBEF7OMssr6NbXMIWhMuV52Svd51SZ-QfIidYy9XQ78LeVqqB_Vgmvinb6vrKHXTV-mmud0CPNPPvmoPBjlDaEi/s320/PXL_20220420_131134130.jpg"           width="320"         />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Trust me, the receipt didn't look this clear cut when I started buying         from these guys a decade ago <span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span>       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div><br /></div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
