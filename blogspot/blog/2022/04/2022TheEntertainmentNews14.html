I   don't normally watch these, but heck, I've been listening to live videos all   evening, I could use something else for a change. You know, like, some   Aki-chan cuteness you guys won't get because she's married and I watched Anime   when she started getting famous a decade and a half ago. Damn me, can you stop   the backlash on yourself? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>  Well, we shall talk about new Anime instead, yes? At least try to be relevant   to them kids but I can only be because it's all romance shows this new season   I can only talk about how hopelessly single I am right now. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I should   stop sh*tting on myself haha </div><div><br /></div><div>  Let's Anime and music then!<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      Uh, apparently resting for a week last Sunday night so tonight for the new       episode.

Haha GOT'EM     </div>  </blockquote>  Like really, are you cool if you don't wear lab coats being in a lab? Come on.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode of a series I wouldn't expect to come back to   (#RikeKoiS201), oh yeah hey Aika long time no see lmao voiced by dear Omigawa   Chiaki by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Like really, if I remembered anything from this   series is that Yukimura is a dumb idiot for not appreciating the banger that   is Himuro haha, everyone else is just here to talk about math and science, and   Kanade-chan is MVP. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Let's not talk about my fetishes haha, instead we   shall talk about what gives them the reason to do this sequel. Firstly, we   have new characters. Uh... they are from the natural sciences lab, and uh... I   think they might already be three seasons of Anime in. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> For yes, in   order to expand their experiments of love, those two, Ibarada suggested them   to another department of sciences considering this is university, who focus on   saliva research. And I wouldn't say that I know of that much but I did watch   whatever that last movie of "Kara no Kyoukai" is to know that anything   saliva-related is disturbing to me lol, but yes, further analysis is easier to   do and acquire once they acquaintance themselves to little boy Chris and his   long time partner and whore (lol) Suiu (or maybe Fujihara if I can't remember   that name) where you know, we are in a different level I guess. Considering   they have experience being together (lol) and have also done some analysis on   themselves too but of course not to as great of an extent to prove it, they   serve to be the rebuttal of whatever we might have thought of now, so, how can   you prove love being a project. But yeah, that's the whole point too just go   find the English translation of this Anime's title, but unsurprisingly, they   do it better than these two who thought they were going at it in the Okinawa   trip kissing on the sunset. Yeah, maybe the mood isn't there or whatever, but   as we know so far, we are basically in a different league compared to the   saliva guys. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, this is the challenge in this new season, I   guess. Next up, the.. uh... amount of rated stuff we might have to deal with.   Because so far, we have only dealt with whatever Ibarada does to her childhood   friend lol which isn't much compared to him towards that idol lmao, but yeah,   as summarized by Yukimura, those aren't anything to get us disturbed... until   they LITERALLY just placed a whore inside this series. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, I want   to be nice, but goddamn, Suiu has everything and anything else but decency.   Like, really. We can only get that many jokes out of the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> levels we   are going to experience in this Anime, so let's see how far our oxytocin   levels can go before thise psychological triggers happen. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Lastly,   well, everyone else, of course, as much as we can get them in. Forget about   Yamamoto that artist or something, but from Ikeda-sensei, to the straightness   of Kanade-chan which never gets old because look at that new couple looking   more ridiculous than the current pair lol, to Rikeikuma being a piece of shit   teacher voiced by a cute girl (lol MOCHO~!!), to Ibarada and Kousuke being   themselves... it's quite a trip to get back after whatever miracle of a kiss   happened in the first season. All in all though? I have a harsh feeling this   is going to lose to the competition. Not because I have been in a lab software   project myself at work that'll make me cringe watching this on the weekends   lol, but something else tells me that ignoring science we can definitely make   things more interesting. Remember guys, the first season was aired in   literally the quietest season of romance shows which helped it a lot. Now that   it has to compete with the other romance sequels we have to watch starting   next week? It's like Yukimura and Himuro against the saliva pair, dude. How   can you just beat the kissing when like, Komi-san just smiles and half the   class drops dead? Haha we shall see about that in the following months, I   guess. Great idea to use this to jump back though, I really am wondering what   is for the ending for this season now.   <div>    [TL:DR; "Is R-18 stuff okay?" This is going to be this season in a nutshell     lmao]   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdJfF3MJIw64JD5oXFuhNVUn70XGOXQy2I9DEnhPo5jo1L8vsXn7stRC_3zVf8bwRKXGSKtf3vdqwR9ESVoJCApODcX6ObTm5FFk-koXmCBt5Ask0R-iTbB1dQYcVj-t-JHEQd6iHlc1o8gg6Di6BxB5ivuVjseIGD_d4-fCkmj9ksc4g6dCsF1KJM/s320/rikekoiS201_ikeda2.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                One of these is not like the others lmao               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="1242"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="311"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5uzduQC0DlOyeAjicgHL1XIHqRUEZ4c44DWoS9jLtjDhCATJZO-vaAZrhj4E-XA8Au7zg0GpJF1kVnRVFY21jTxSwnO8w3TJd2G9i_zmXkeRMa01BGQhJfLuYBzdkRGjpYUpaU8UZ_dvYQp_grANhnGB-FdnRKLvUStD61XU85zbubPqQiRXZAGhb/s320/rikekoiS201_coats.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                It's about lab coats but we know it's about cleavage <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1973"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm2PxZZ__XykjlxMZbC7E1Oi1E2R3POwdQgA3NtnTDOAFe10yr2mcyFfgmoxAY-BG3hl-hXs1uu5WIJErpIDalgue73rBfQboyal9wXD-yRAUTSMxSxG5TSSsYNxJqm-eRNXnxBl9nxhTit2rd62ujBKEo1UrQGzqRRuriMp0-JvcEk1s0Tc-6UBpP/s320/rikekoiS201_trio2.jpg"                   width="493"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                The jokes of this series in a nutshell lol               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    </div>    P.S.

Uh, I don't know how     to describe it, but I'll take it along the lines of social distancing *OOF*,     but not of a pandemic because she will be quarantined to hell haha, but of     just socializing in general. Meet Aharen Reina, a cute little girl (voiced     by     <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank"       >Minase Inori</a     >    and that's how I knew of this hahahahaha) who is nice and friendly but...     you can barely hear her speak. And it's not just because she can't     communicate (haha), she can she has more friends than me <span title="*sob*">😢</span>, but that's     the problem in itself. Maybe, Raidou, you should talk to the OTHER guy     beside you in class. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, story. There are a lot of things wrong     about this we should clarify at first, just so you know. Firstly, why is     this girl sitting at the last row of the classroom? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I feel like     this is a logistical mistake but Anime dude, one can see from the back of     the class, she got 20/20 eyesight AND x-ray vision lmao. And then, her     appetite. I really thought it's just her needing this much fuel but probably     so, because from her waking up early and then crashing making the guy some     lunch because his mother wasn't going to lol, it feels weird once again to     have like, a little girl eating crazy amounts of food but hey when was the     last time you saw those though? I like an unrealistic slice-of-life series.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Even so, literally only Raidou who sits beside her thinks it's     weird. Like, yeah, the others don't even care. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Lastly, how much     they actually paid Minase Inori who voiced Aharen in this very episode.     <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I'm pretty sure she wasn't in the recording studio. Haha jokes     aside, she did talk this first episode just in case people be complaining     "where my Inorin at?" lol, since technically speaking one can hear     Reina-chan here, just that, in order to hear her, you gotta have good ears     which I think mine's a little screwed thanks to my sinus, and then you gotta     be sticking on to her, or vice versa, to hear the magic. I wish this is a     fever dream where it applies to IRL idols too lmao, but yeah, that just     makes of a good joke considering Raidou went through everything to try to     not make that closeness happen. Gotta say though, maybe you need to brush up     on your not sciences lol since she be just throwing notes at you all the     time. As you can see, this is just a straight out funny and ridiculous     series and that isn't bad, but will this beat the likes of other romance     series though? We will have to see. I liked the theme songs they are okay     they dumped in TrySail anyways haha, the story so far is just flat out     awkward funny, and don't ask me why it's produced by China. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But     yeah, if you are finding a romance series where you get the cute girl to     stick to you and that is still called being classmates only, you've come to     the right place. Like really, if others don't want to be friends with her     I'll do it. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Yeah, I saw that friend I assume lurking around the     corner we shall see if someone else can provide a different perspective to     this next episode   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR; Let's get this going, because Raidou's     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> for     MVP!!
