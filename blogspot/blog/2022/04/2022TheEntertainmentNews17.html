And if this sucks I'll go   back to splitting them between Saturday and Sunday lol<br /><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS204">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">        Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "We need to do regular girl-like things every once in a while" Wise words,       Kanade-chan haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Serious talk though, like, why are the girls in this series not girls besides   Kanade-chan? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where Anime girls are unlike girls   in real life (#RikeKoiS204), or maybe we are dealing with science students   so... ah hey don't tell me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This episode though, we have a lot more   lore than I expected so let's get into it. Firstly, why the girls in Ikeda Lab   never hang out. Like, no shit, they are science students, and Kanade is the   only normal one and she hardly goes out with her friends so... so what else is   new? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And of course, we learnt about shut-in Ibarada and no-friends   Himuro (lol) so there's that haha. It was an experience though, it's like the   stuff I would do with my friends... maybe twice a year lmao not surprising I'm   a loner too. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Then, Ibarada helping out with research. It's ironic to   say her buddy Torasuke would be at the experiment location, so chances are,   the experiment is at a live event. I'm not going to talk about how much I am   like Torasuke in that regard, but put like, Himuro as Aika and Ten-chan as   whoever that voice actress was on stage singing and dancing and you wonder why   I didn't like them light sticks. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So yeah, that was the experiment,   that is probably geared to sell to production studios if they are interested   in creating a more engaging environment because why wouldn't you they   literally stopped people from shouting during the pandemic might as well sell   these out now lol, and that's how you think of ideas for your university   project, looking at Torasuke swinging them stick in front of a TV. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   And yeah, they did talk a little more about Ibarada which I might just   classify her as cute but in a different way so don't try to bait me into   liking her because Kanade-chan is still MVP until she gets... a... boyfriend   haha MOVING ON!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least, Yukimura as a tutor. I   seriously think most if all students that aren't in top class in schools   should be watching this or any YouTube videos which teach science in a fun   way, because damn Yukimura is the best kind of tutor anyone would want,   talking about how science relates to life and how boring things then get when   I tell you to look at the numbers on the exam paper. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, let's not   spoil them fun for the kids, shall we? Math is a class of science we have to   deal with even if we don't want to lol. But yeah, between   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tapioka" target="_blank">bubble tea</a>&nbsp;on new gal Haru and that poop from the Rikekuma... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all,   I gotta say this second season is printing out good episodes after another,   and I'm really into it now. It is a slow start just to remember what's good   about the series, but I'm glad with new characters which we might just see her   again you think Himuro would mind? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> That you know, we may see more   than science happening you know what I'm sayin'? Haha I mean we are already   going to talk about Kanade-chan getting laid soon so excuse me while I go cry   at a corner lmao </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1331" data-original-width="1280" height="333" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYWC9jOQJml2CAG2JFWIbDbWkHWc2sPf5PH_IJDg9usGroFebTqwZsHHLobpjhL2ExENUZMDqOsSwCUMra8LKjGeUHVAZgRnvaahXP6DGqach5hpeTtQ8x1hD_FmsQviLYkCG-okMLbKEh0E_t7Ouqzvh7tTfZyk6Je0V3x0XcX62CqTw2vKPzETOg/s320/rikekoiS204_ibarada4.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              JK spot the difference contest baby! lol<br />(This one might be               overgrown already but you know, chuunibyou)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1582" data-original-width="1280" height="395" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPrA7kYMkXGgL0BvzcVMKRPltAQiuc_nU6BqWV3m020ZBf2b3UUs05r8l6F6nU4t1YAX6ZBeTE0BGogRnXofW_TQCwFYTkdxZu6lRqb7CtxvHyYRVRzsvgxYIpXIGv_3tT-rMv5qekOmCanssGOIIZTBHU_Mz1JusmqTuNFqFY-qGfwMsXAyGTcdW7/s320/rikekoiS204_haru1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              JK spot the difference contest baby! lol<br />(Well this one's               legitimate haha)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Maybe not huh, the homeroom and PE teacher probably knew better. In   this new episode and I can't believe I'll be saying this (#AharenSan04), but   let me introduce you to serious and boring Kana-chan. Please, Anime, can we   stop ruining the perfect impression that is voice actress Hanazawa Kana? Anime   "Yesterday wo Utatte" as   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/68127/Shinako_Morinome" target="_blank">a woman who hasn't dated anyone</a>  and now this?? What is this, virgin hour? She's married dude- Okay story.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We talk about new character, it seems, and that is literature teacher   Toubaru-sensei. This teacher... she has problems. Apparently more   psychological then physical despite what rumours say about her, because to put   it simply she is just totally into the boy-girl relationships as if she read   from her favourite romance books and she tries to explain them in class. If   you need Anime references (and I'm very good at them now been watching them   since 2008) it's just   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/178037/Ami_Asai" target="_blank">Ami-chan in Anime "Uzaki-chan"</a>  with a bowl of rice because it goes well with the sweetness in   relationships... but Toubaru-sensei doesn't have them. So she just bleeds out.   And this is the effect, it seems, as at this point, the teacher can barely   hold herself to do an hour-long lesson without cringing on Raidou and Aharen's   interactions which we have learnt, mainly because of the girl's quirkiness to   be honest. Speaking of Aharen, and I think the analysing her emotions thing is   kinda boring so we might just skip that, we talk about rapping being Aharen's   favourite genre of (I wouldn't call it) music. Because seriously, F**K YOU   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/168491/Minami_Yamamoto" target="_blank">YAMAMOTO from Anime "JoshiMuda"</a>; Minase Inori rapping be the new thing in 2022 now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Nice, Anime,   nice. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And yeah we got the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> to do it   too!! Nice, Rikachimalu, nice. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Might be too much of it though,   because despite microphones not being allowed to bring into school which I   would argue you can just make a fake one just for style, it's also a pain to   communicate in this way all the time because as Raidou said, it's like a   battle every time they don't have to eat lunch anymore. Remember Aharen needs   a lot of fuel despite her small build? Yeah, burnt all of it on rapping.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But thanks to this series, we are blessed with more voice actors   rapping, and I take that any time of the day haha. Raidou's sister felt bad   though for not recognizing her brothers... talent lol, so she gave him a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/handosupina-" target="_blank">fidget spinner</a>. Because seriously, do you even know there are still some of them sitting on   my colleague's desk at the office even till this day? Haha, if you haven't   seen them, you be missing out. Claimed as the new trending item to curb   boredom... five years ago lmao, Aharen got so into it she can't sleep, she got   the kids at the park with her sweet tricks, and she should really stop playing   them in class even though Toubaru-sensei can't really see from the front of   the class. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, the comedy stacks up. And who cares about Futaba-chan   that loser can't even win Aharen at Reversi. *winks* All in all, trust me I   laughed way too much at this series just this episode alone, and damn Anime,   thanks for delivering. Haha I gotta take a break my insides hurt lol not going   to nosebleed though I'm not that far up comedy's a** </div><div>  [TL:DR; "I need to understand what Aharen-san is trying to convey faster, or   there will be trouble." Oh yeah there will be trouble alright this is how this   series works bro] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnkdw2iHN9Hi0LPllrAraO3_md9FczERYZlJMKIbBcn6jgdf8DMBm_Elng691RRnHcnSSs4XQ6QmYtfxwe3w7lPTKbiia1uDJrNNdRvalMD4sGULj4o61QNWyDqhYGSNm_DJDFPnKOAZGwvbRolIVB8npLAd34DInHwYIzKD7j20AMcaRd_j49OmWc/s320/aharensan04_rap1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I saw this, and I knew, we are going to get some rapping going               this episode<br />(lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3BKpv4vfjazFRKYcOB83jriqIQ8j1tZzrAMYlUIF2-sOvz7YHH_Ww6XfDMRB6vmmCqXBZeNguTKKxqhbXf6L8apd1QAbNGsrB7OlCx9J5HSK8HlCYHjIiZ9gzMKoQkAKECzu7KSsYJ8tRNhi5jFtBNnUTwHZq-pjX0x5WMSeh4z70pgUfyeBYZ-Ao/s320/aharensan04_toubaru8.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me at that moment thinking about how great Inorin rapping would be               haha             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

GREAT START haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Dude, and that's why you cannot cheat on your girl with another she will have   problems on who to assassinate. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where hey   Nagisa-chan is back (#KaguyaSamaS303), looks like we have more relationship   issues on our hands, so let's talk about all of them. Firstly, Nagisa. Again,   with context it is just so much better, but yeah, Nagisa thinks her guy is   cheating on her. Of course, this is the most sceptical of judgement we can   make for what was purely just her bestie helping to buy an anniversary gift   because who goes out to buy gifts for your girl with the girl herself lol, we   just had to find out for ourselves. You know, all other ways including private   detective BUT asking the guy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey way to go Nagisa, you do you. Best   part is, they slapped Kaguya's situation with the karaoke on it along with   Miko-chan who is just innocent as she is complying because you know, somehow   they make me believe that the boyfriend is also cheating on Nagisa too so   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Good thing Mocho is a cheap b*tch isn't it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then, the   fallout. It was meant to be cheap, the gift. Oooooh didn't expect this level   of romance drama here but LET'S GO haha, we are introduced to another   character... of which her relation to Kaguya does not matter lmao, Maki-chan   is it? Yeah, she be basically so similar to Kaguya herself, and I will just   say it here and now, that we pretty much have like, the summary of this series   including the ending haha, within like, half an episode. Because so much so as   Maki here is such a jealous b*tch and tsundere amongst all things, she also   cutely exhibits someone hot in infatuation that even those guys who sit with   her on the student council table (or shall we call it the romance consultation   helpdesk) found her irresistible. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> <i>Don't tell Kaguya-</i> OH MY   GOD SHE IS HERE <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also Ishigami, you know too much about romance   problems. Stop writing the script for this series, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but   not least, I guess it's a little easier to identify to if I referred to that,   we play an equivalent of truth and dare game, but just the truth part. Okay   maybe not a good analogy but you get the idea. Normally, these games do not   involve using an item to analyze the lies, but turns out,   <strike>Fujiwara brought in the lie detector</strike> we don't have to do   anything and we already know Fujiwara will be lying. Haha seriously though I   might have forgot about it until the end to be honest; We should've known   there are only two honest people in the student council. No really, you don't   have to use another coin of a different year to know who they are, trust me.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, jealous easy b*tch Nagisa for best girl lmao, can't wait   for Maki-chan to ruin their relationship which is never according to our   experience with Kaguya here lol we can make three seasons of the drama and   nothing would have happened, and... how can ANYONE hate Miko-chan?

You don't want to know how Tadano realized you're a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chuunibyou" target="_blank">chuunibyou</a>. It's in his childhood memories. "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kurorekishi" target="_blank">Black history</a>", we call it.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In the new episode (#KomiSan15) where you know when you laughed too   much on the above one could use a break, and I gotta say this one does so very   nicely. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> So firstly, I think everyone in class can take part in this   too, we analyze the thoughts of Komi-san in order to know her better. Spoiler   alert, Tadano probably knows her best so don't expect too much, but yeah, they   are rather far off even if Yamai and Nakanaka tried. They got as close to   common logic but you know, sometimes Komi-san be still stuck at not being able   to see that rainbow outside the classroom. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, just do normal   stuff like hang out with people, yes? Komi-san isn't exactly having a tight   schedule haha. Next up, hell yeah we got this back again, we have another   boys' discussion similar to the one last time, so basically just to wrap up on   the other two we missed AND come up with something for Komi-san that isn't   like, marriage life for Tadano. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But seriously though, I highly doubt   the class know enough of the girls in class to put Nakanaka on the top rank   somehow but we might be dealing with a bunch of gamers so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, we   are not comparing on voice actresses so I get it. (Hehe RumiRumi FTW!!! lol)   And then, we have lunch time. Lunch time with Katai-kun. Haha, that got you   all in surprise isn't it? Hey, even the most awkward dude in class wants to   have some social time with his newly made friends lol remember he just came   back to school after months of MIA, did not want Komi-san involved somehow so   thanks Tadano for noticing that and bringing her in, and Najimi joined in on   this group lunch session because they are making sure Tadano doesn't rat the   other two out to each other. You know, that they both have communication   problems- MOVING ON!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And I gotta say the last part is so sweet I   want myself some   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yakiimo" target="_blank">baked sweet potatoes</a>  now, nice guy silent dad gave the daughter some money as he saw her feeling   nervous and he heard the call of the night (which happens for suburban or   countryside level stall tenants in case you only lived in the city), and let   her experience what it is like to, you know, buy some sweet potatoes from the   stall, dude. I recall the days when I was a kid living in the city state with   the good ol' bread seller on the streets, and I would call for some freshly   made bread with kaya butter... Yeah, that. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It's kind of the same here   in Japan, just that the uncle driving the truck thought this was a horror   film. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not going to reference that game I think only Easterners know   but when the host looks at the group coming at him/her you are not supposed to   move so I guess Komi-san be part of the group lol, nice guy uncle decided to   treat the dear kid to some, but of course she had the money so yeah. Kids, but   they have money. Adults, we call them. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And yeah Tadano how DARE you   get a piece of the action. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, this series is just nothing   but content to offer considering there is so much to talk about even if we   don't focus on the main couple to be honest, and let's see if we can make a   Christmas miracle happen in the not winter season lol this is going to be   harder than guessing Komi-san's thoughts haha </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiq79M9IOl5iTBjDnkPmU_VWyXdW-enqW_jfVzPSWiaGnhAUIMSIvVwLBZEtuwGZ2zZ50ULMNcoDb8aw17wN0yvRVD9OBTYb26k6z7r96Ircsuyue505ZpL6Bn5TW8xcfBHwQa5HcMFk9vvEh2TfqGwdx27B5nxKqxTGVgJ9Od70tHwrORN-BrdQCpY/s320/komisan15_kaede2.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Everyone needs some Kaede-chan hug every once in a while tbh             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhMGu3M5-QOO_lYkbcBhfSzCDKoh9JfRStoc8VIy3FZxRo2OYmgMgcZjYDEyon1ktgsAjtXB9CCqpsFTKfIZt0rMAujU8faUVkoEO6fbw5WbzlP0f67Olfx9i4uDNfG6HAsugYQAqUjzFOp8rEiw2M_OJ6tFPtpdQQ17mHYhiyjffnktkgZXc1ob9x/s320/komisan15_katai4.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              NOT THIS<br />(lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdfGGEpt3NrsJlIhsivsUDmHfyO1VQdINgoxP3IgWmEzsDBYMFOfpqPfuTrKX0IEREa6qGF50jdXeiTZissGThSYSSQ8Zf5SoAcI9YTAmBFxK6c4dn7UBj4Ci2qtnsPYjo6Ki1PO1N0WhhaONLjldzAF-QoF-VhQbpXfIjK4JBIio2VLrtz6FIbd_D/s320/komisan15_onemine1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Everyone needs a nice onee-san for a while, I know             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAForkrKhkrHfDbiYYE2iUrNeSBajMnxen7Oobdycem5xybPCAAP7nzAgeutUqfZ_ybgLoarPb3lHc6ts7KoV0vYEf4rfTvWAZaDKhhDGy8bL1--YxgYFFsaAZITCAKvw83DWzpd2h2CpqhdsZrcVbp609tN_4fRWmIHRX6gP7TbbEYNxe-clvqIlL/s320/komisan15_yamai.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              NOT THIS<br />(lmao)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Haha I don't think so but in this   new episode (#ShikimoriSan03) we be going on a movie date!! FINALLY, a proper   date I'm starting to wonder if these two are actually a couple. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And   yeah, deciding episode by the way, they throw all this out just to make sure   you- I'M IN!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, let's talk about why this is better than I   expected. Firstly, when you have a friend who gives you free movie tickets.   Please, I'm not that nice but then again I don't have access to such stuff   so... oh well Izumi lucky you I guess despite who you are. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Of course   he gotta bring his girl out, but as we find out soon enough even without the   actual event itself, he... uh, tends to be unlucky in the worst of situations.   Like, losing your wallet? That's a problem. Do you bring your smartphone out?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> If not, keep it at home, seriously. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay he did, so may I   recommend you use some sort of phone payment option- Okay, maybe not. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   But you get the idea, that even technology can't save this God of Misfortune   to any extent, which I wish you were also rich so you can put it on the tab on   the places you visit in town lol, but yeah, those don't exist. What does exist   though, is Shikimori's choice of movies because we insist she executes her   freedom of choice or else we leave. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And coincidentally if you thought   of dating one Waki Azumi you would be relieved to know that she is also into   horror movies, so make sure you scream through the halls of the movie theatre   so she can laugh at you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, at least this one went better than the   previous date- It didn't. Haha even Shikimori's worst choice of clothes to   wear for the date won't compare to Izumi snapping the strap of his   disaster-prevention bag. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least, and that's why I already   think this is already worth watching, is the parents coming in to save the   day. Izumi's parents, for measure, are pretty much the same as these two in   some aspects without the coolness I guess, but are more than relieved to know   of Shikimori herself being such a perfect prospective daughter-in-law, you   wish your parents were happier seeing your partner for the first time.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, can't be happier if you don't see one. *taps brain* Anyways, and   this is where it counts, they dined at his place since someone lost his wallet   lol, they played video games lmao shout out to the Nintendo Wii, and the   mother had some pep talk with the girl. Just as Shikimori described though,   that Izumi's luck isn't just much as inherited (though probably it is, look at   the super cautious mom who is barely keeping herself safe haha) but is also   making him stronger as a person as he learns of pain and knows to lessen that   pain for others around him, thus making him nice. Man, I really need a reason   to be a nice guy. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, this series is so cool, I could cry. All   in all though, yes I'm in this I guess as much as I'm packed with shows to   watch this season, I'll give this genuinely because I want to date Oonishi   Saori- Oh I can't? Haha well then this is as close as you can get. So yeah   thanks Anime for letting her voice this gem, and may we never find out about   Shikimori's problems haha wink wink don't jinx it Izumi lol </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj559QBDwWTRGpqJzcHz2gISV_B0nqljI3gAXTdN2Fo9n12mgpVmKAl6YU_GNhIeidLwjwif-ZsvDbtbl3untRCPLPhoLx6Wd8Ojy98miFRb_CvPlR0dBmfPtSD7UnGgOwr-LdPYgzYx1GPay3XBsXsrTlhadIHe_dHSmY7tNczihTBlelIR8Qwy1Uz/s320/shikimorisan03_parents.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Probably my parents when one day I said "I have a girlfriend"               lol<br />(<span title="*sob*">😢</span>)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjjWtIxEu8RUrv6eJAlnX3aHrsR0ZMmHQPsKTHjbXVLjfINenb8VqSdJKJYUpujM4LPne-hOVsnFt8uMjw-lPc5LN7gXHzGcnqK4zoxwLrHkLTGlndotcTZZgbLHGjTzwqQQBzE3vPO6BbXEio1jSHtjt2qS698LvOUPpHfze_xj4ziuPZ9UjKNvIOV/s320/shikimorisan03_accident.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              What parents see when kids say they are fine after playing outside               haha             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Though I would argue I might be two weeks late   to giving   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ao-100-syoku-komi-cant-communicate-opening-theme-ep/1614941059?l=en" target="_blank">Itou Miku's new single</a></b>  for Anime "Komi-san", I am still glad I get to grab a copy of the CD and talk   about it... maybe next month. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Yes, ma bro, happy now? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Other   than that, we can talk about new songs now haha that is already old in Klassic   Note timing,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E9%99%BD%E3%81%AF%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E6%98%87%E3%82%8B%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89-single/1615739699?l=en" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</a></b>  is a meh so I'm just giving the topic song which is already pretty average   fare going by their standards, and   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bubble/1617580660?l=en" target="_blank">PHONO TONES' new album</a></b>  wins because it has been a while since we got them and thanks to SPECIAL   OTHERS releasing two months later, we get to enjoy some instrumentals which I   don't hate. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I did give a good amount including the ones released   digital last year when they announced their start to 10 years making music so   yay, I can always take more of this.<br />  <br />  On Twitter music news of Japan or as much as I know in Klassic Note,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1517880982002536448?s=20&amp;t=PumX8rIE0SYiT9m7FGzeng" target="_blank">Yoshioka Kiyoe's new song</a></b>  for that Anime is uh... I really don't care even if it's written by   "RyokuShaka" just because it's no Ikimonogakari so I guess we are at the end   of the line for now until I get impressed somehow which is not now, Primary's   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1517837446561828864?s=20&amp;t=PumX8rIE0SYiT9m7FGzeng" target="_blank">yuiko has finally revealed a new song</a></b>  for some indie event but also is evidence that she is no longer associated   with regular composer Meis Clauson and is taking charge of her own songs by   putting old songs under her name,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/airimania/status/1517158638024298496?s=20&amp;t=PumX8rIE0SYiT9m7FGzeng" target="_blank">Suzuki Airi's new music video</a></b>  for Anime "Kaguya-sama" is actually good- This is what you can get as   Ikimonogakari's replacement guys haha oh the single is going to release in   June, I tried to listen to   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1517134075404128256?s=20&amp;t=PumX8rIE0SYiT9m7FGzeng" target="_blank">yanaginagi's new work</a></b>  which is for VTuber Amane Kanata but it didn't go well lol, apparently   eufonius and nano.RIPE contributed to   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/marble_2020/status/1518069757387304961?s=20&amp;t=M9C64Ix2Tv5DZ0knvDk-9g" target="_blank">marble's new indie single</a></b>  which I have no idea of and where can I listen to it online, and   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1515993791358025728?s=20&amp;t=PumX8rIE0SYiT9m7FGzeng" target="_blank">more Taketatsu Ayana live videos</a></b>  on her music YouTube channel just in case you missed them. Okay serious talk   though? Where can we get them indie releases on digital streaming because   that's all I can pay? Haha someday, yes? (Edit: Oh this   <a href="https://online.m3net.jp/" target="_blank">M3 event</a> is physical   but also online where a series of livestreams showcase the artists involved;   Still no release announcements unless you are there though) </div><div>  <br />Next week I may just pick up some of the Anime theme songs from above   which do not have an official physical release date or whatever, so we can   avoid waiting for months considering how RumiRumi kept praising the Anime   "Komi-san" ending song recently lol yeah I'll give that a chance,   <b>FantasticYouth</b>? I don't have those so you tell me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also on the   list is also Anime-related, for <b>Anime "Kaguya-sama" best album</b> of their   character and theme songs over the years but excluding those we have heard in   recent episodes, so maybe it's a good time to give the character songs another   chance. Or not. We shall see haha I'm not that into Anime songs as I am a   decade ago if you haven't noticed<br />  <br /><br />  <br />  <br />  As I see my weekend come to an end, I can't help but think that work really,   really, REALLY sucks- Cya guys next week then haha we really should stop   talking about work life, and until next time though? Maybe we will enjoy that   long weekend. I seriously need to think of what to do though, I was thinking   of playing a Switch game for a week and complete the Star Wars story just like   how I tried to understand the Halo series, but uh... maybe I should write more   blog posts. Like, I have a laundry list worth of drafts I've not published   just because I am lazy to write them. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Until next week then haha </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. Watching through old making videos of Kitou Akari and I can only say... I   miss her long hair haha oh well I already bought her new fanclub event goods   already so she wins haha she also wins in number of months subbed to a fanclub   by next month as it will be more than a year. Akarin suki~ hehe </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
