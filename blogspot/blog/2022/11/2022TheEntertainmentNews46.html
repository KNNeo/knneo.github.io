BUT!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also Elon   doesn't like me so I may think of moving Klassic Note to Instagram; They have   support for sharing in Apple Music too. </div><div><br /></div><div><span title="*silence*">😐</span></div><div><br /></div><div>  On the good news side though, after much dedication (for the week haha) of   doing some exercise for the week ie. like every other day for an hour max...   hey guess what, I feel better now, what a surprise. Turns out I just have to   be normal and watch more Anime and listen to more Japanese music!!! <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>   Okay let's get to it though I saw enough spoilers for BLEACH on the   <a href="http://anicobin.ldblog.jp/archives/59899515.html" target="_blank"     >Japanese bulletin boards</a   >  haha yes I read that also apparently they review episodes by putting   screencaps with Twitter tweets and people commenting on those is actually   ironically funny if you can understand OR have Google Translate handy lol<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BLEACHTYBW05">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "(Ichigo's) Bankai can't be stolen by Quincies!" Well, ironically it's not       that it can't be, but also, he's main guy so of course not haha     </div>  </blockquote>  I appreciate Zaraki's enthusiasm for Ichigo's arrival to Soul Society haha but   bro, not this soon I'm afraid. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> For what happened in this new episode   (#BLEACHTYBW05) wouldn't make the Kenpachi himself too happy just yet, because   damn, is Ichigo stuck in the world of Garganta. Alone. In a spiritual energy   jail from the enemy. Hmm... now what? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yes, guys, this is the   beat'em up arc and I mean the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>  because damn did the enemy put themselves at such an advantage I would say   they are cheating, and they did steal their powers away from them so yeah,   totally. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, do we still have so much to talk about, just like   Zaraki's overflowing desire for fight. So let's ignore Ichigo stuck in that   jail and discuss about the fights of the shinigami. Firstly, Byakuya not doing   too well though, as so is Renji. After losing his Bankai, the captain really   can't do much as to even fight against the enemy considering also yes, they   can use their Bankai against them. As As Nodt (lol) noted (not grammar mistake   btw) with his deep voice and boy I've never heard harem master voice actor   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka"     target="_blank"     >Matsuoka</a   >  sound so boring before lmao but I guess it's adequate haha we have been here   from that Lycoris Anime, there's no way one can fight against their Bankai   with just even their Shikai, and even then you still gotta find out your own   sword's weakness in order to retaliate, so that's not fun. (In his defence   mine's a Kido-based sword and I excel at Kido so f**k me too if mine gets   stolen haha maybe I can do punches like Yamamoto to Wonderweiss? lol) (My bro   is right just modify to prevent it from killing thyself like Mayuri) So yeah,   no surprise, they all got beat up real bad, and maybe we are hoping that   Ichigo will come and save all of them at some point. Not now though, they are   on their own, Rukia included. Next up, we can stop Ichigo from fighting in   Soul Society but we can't stop Kenpachi from killing three Sternritters at   once. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, <i>technically </i>he didn't and we will eventually talk   about why he only killed two of them hehe, but yeah, he strong. Not strong   enough though considering he wants to fight against God's son so uh, maybe set   the bar lower a bit, Zaraki. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Also his eyepatch isn't- Oh it's undone   already. Oops. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least, and this is why I've been so hyped   about this final arc, we have our first new Bankai reveal. Hisagi was fighting   the one Sternritter who held now deceased (RIP) Sasakibe's powers and   interestingly the powers live on as they die, we shall not talk about why   Hisagi wouldn't use his Bankai considering his enemy can't hold two but then   again what if another one drops in and goes into a suicide pact with him   <span title="*wink*">😉</span> (Uh, that's... a light novel side story reveal haha), but regardless,   old man geezer arrived to save his life but probably also, he might have   realized a familiar attack that got his right-hand man in the grave. Spiritual   grave, we call it. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, the same fate happened to Yamamoto as   with Byakuya ie. the Bankai was used on him just not his which is a relief,   because that fire can't be contained as he swiftly removed this overkill of an   idiot. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Kenpachi, but better. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What IS the highlight of this   episode though is the flashback, as we mentioned about how loyalty works here,   Sasakibe is THE definition of loyalty in this story probably more than me for   my work lol I need to change jobs haha, as he stays by old man all the time   even going to the lengths of learning his Bankai to try to compensate for the   old man's weaknesses which frankly is none lol, but still. To put a dent on   him would make taking this kid more seriously, and also, know what it means to   have to fight with someone who knows his sword, not like stupid Sternritter   who thinks this Bankai is a toy. Pft, how disgusting. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, I'm   not going to talk about who killed Kirge but he's super dead now not even   Ransotengai can save him lol, Ichigo will be stuck in there for a bit the   Scrift's power is kinda absolute and that's the point, and next up, old man   gonna fight Quincy God, so that'll be exciting. Not going to spoil the outcome   but remember what I mentioned about a beat'em up? Sshh quiet me we gotta   witness another Bankai release first. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Haha see you all then. </div><div>  [TL:DR; "The heart burns, even if the rain falls."

Dude,   you smart. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then again, remember when we talked about Hana-chan being   middle schooler? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, instant paralysis for the sister working on   a Sunday and boy did I laugh out hard on that, as Yanagi tries to get the   attention of Sakurai just to know more about him, I must say maybe it's just   on her character but great choice on doing all of this after the morning peak   crowd lol that's me on weekends too I eat breakfast past nine <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, really   got into conversation with this maybe future brother-in-law (just maybe) by   talking about the stuff they like the most: video games. Yep, and that's why   there's a resident gamer in the Uzaki family, and it's not the brother.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... I hope that's enough to be honest. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah   Hana-chan here is feeling the pain we should stop bullying her. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But   damn, really didn't expect much of this development until it happens though.   Hey, maybe the guys in the Uzaki family are this impression until we get into   the stories of MILF and gamers, amirite fellas?? <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Don't ask me why these   genres but it works on Sakurai, so he wins. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Uzaki Hana, what did you   say about timeline? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I gotta go to cook more rice, I gotta haha I   really wonder what can be up next maybe get the brother involved from what was   in the next episode title </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="720"               data-original-width="1280"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiju8lAPBtiuclNMTxomDMsJntF8DYWxDU4tLRFbP57eZI3IKI9GIziVMY1Kp1LK0RcPdZ1M32LWANoEiFCHpB4xGFstdBjnurA66KLxyos_EcJhVikEySD4HaXuvh1a4rh7P2FxjhYitriVRHhX7_cDFuFOaJeHxJcs7HSzM9z_3zAgAAkZj3J_YBf/s320/uzakichanS207_uzaki8.jpg"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Only in Anime can you have boomerang stuck into someone's huge             rack-<br />(Haha or a round trip on Instagram and you'll find one)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table       align="center"       cellpadding="0"       cellspacing="0"       class="tr-caption-container"       style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"     >      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img               border="0"               data-original-height="180"               data-original-width="320"               height="180"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1rZLRF61z9uBkSZfz03NJu2AjdK_fpd_kgXiOUemdtHnuq-7K2E1489N5_9QT2Fzh-gmEM3AMdtSJJHK6DYWbZ3FpBF6MsOOzVFSZyeolv1RyrcIxeeQ-aB2xi7JMeIprlYXiXTuQjJLnJH7R_x6FPXJHaSgR5c6YHsTHgW5m0bldf1Y2HErQHYkM/s1600/uzakichanS207_smirk.gif"               width="320"             />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            I saw this and I already know this gonna be good episode hehe           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </div></div><div>  P.S.

We had to call in   fifth wave feminism to have a winter king just because a God said so. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, in this new episode where maybe liberating my soul could be done by   the one and only Jusetsu haha ah hey (#KoukkyuNoKarasu07), hey we finally got   to see for ourselves <strike>Bingyue</strike> Jusetsu's true form. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   No really, who gives a shit about that weak f**k we have what technically is   God's messenger here, <i>bro</i>. So, what I thought was revenge of the   previous dynasty turned out to be not the case. I also assumed that Bingyue is   some sorcerer who can live past his time and still do magic, but sadly, he's   already dead and is possessing human bodies all this time around which will   explain why Jiu-Jiu was holding something sharp to her neck. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Hey, it   got Jusetsu mad alright. Remember what your predecessor mentioned about not   forming relationships? This is attachment, I tell ya. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Ignoring that,   she did a great job despite knowing this guy is already dead, and would still   listen to his request even if she wasn't blackmailed, still ended up helping   him just because she respects her own job of... moderating souls in this   world? Yeah, I think. Anyways, it has got to to with Bingyue's partner   probably fiancé at this point, but hey, we know where she is right now, up on   a willow tree as a ghost. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> *ahem* Did I mention this story was dark?   Yeah, take note on that. As their engagement was in order, so was a change of   dynasty. All of them were dead with reasons I don't want to explain, but the   partner chose to hang herself to prevent ridicule, and also chose to keep the   marriage gift ie. a comb, a secret so to not let this treasure be taken away   by people of the new era. So, she buried it. Thank goodness. So that's a story   done haha yeah this is it by the way I was expecting some backstabbing but   turns out the only thing we stabbed this episode was a cursed beast haunting   the emperor's bed. Yeah. About that, and that's why the golden chicken   technically didn't stop Jusetsu and why she has to act on this alone, is   because she found a familiar smell of a beast by the bed and couldn't help but   notice also why the aide talked about souls of the emperor's loved ones coming   in to protect said entity. It was a curse, set by you guessed it, that damn   Dowager before she was beheaded to make sure the emperor was cursed beyond his   life and forever even after she is gone. Damn. Women, amirite?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well,   just this woman, because not only did Jusetsu help to send that cursed beast   away, she also helped the emperor's best buddy and his mother depart into the   afterlife. Hey, what other benefactor will save you in this way, and is cute?   <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Last but not least, the new laws of the dynasty. I would expect the   emperor had to explain the reasons behind these changes to his officials, but   as the Consorts were busy having tea and their faces stuffed with buns lmao I   was referring to just Jusetsu hehe   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kawaii" target="_blank">kawaii</a>, he came   in to deliver the good news at her place, mostly about how he changed laws to   stop the policy of killing the previous dynasty Luan race, set up rules to do   king level respect between the two kings and so that's why the emperor kneeled   in front of her, and how he wants to be friends with her. Well the last one is   just personal to be honest haha but damn if every generation was like this   such that the previous two things will work in the empire's favour, that'll be   nice. But we know that's not true, so we shall see how it goes then. Also,   Jiu-Jiu was not a friend by the way, status not high enough. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> *ahem*   Man, I really hope this is still the honeymoon period because apart from the   kings not being able to date each other lmao, I would like to not think that   this is a prelude to something bad to end the series. Hey, I don't know *ahem*   something bad can still happen. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But damn, this is quite a story so   far, ladies and gentlemen. If it hasn't satisfied your drama-filled mind yet,   it has for me. Maybe viewing everything bad from the start might not be great,   but what do I know. There is still chance for a rebellion... right? Yeah, just   not between the kings, but everything can change I guess. Haha let's see how   bad this gets moving on. </div><div>  [TL:DR; The summer king is to protect the other from the adversities of   physical rule, while the winter king is to protect the other from spiritual   elements.

Not... give it beforehand haha yes I've   heard them in full long before through her Monday late night radio show (of   course I watched an archive courtesy of China lol) so I already pre-ordered   it. But because I live in not Japan and I want to save a buck or two in   international shipping because it won't appear by today anyways which   <a     href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1581963230586576896?s=20&amp;t=w4qaB0vwlTgkCDyIIO4-aA"     target="_blank"     >the paper form with a registration code</a   >  (to get a chance to get a potted plant decorated by her) due by today is   INSIDE of the physical release... we'll talk about more next week. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%9F%E3%83%81%E3%83%B2%E3%83%A6%E3%82%B1-ep/1650726750?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</a     ></b   >  was close for me to put it in this order too to be honest but it didn't but   damn are we already at that stage where I can deal with the comforts of   listening to this band's songs and not worry if they are bad. Well, for this   year, to say the least. We shall see moving on I'm only getting more critical   of giving melodies by the year so don't mind me. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I also listened to   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/suits-me-suits-you/1651436459?l=en"       target="_blank"       >wacci's new album</a     ></b   >  because I've listened to their songs even this year, and picked up a couple of   emotional tunes that caught my ears. I don't think they are great so my   expectations aren't high, but even then it's not like they took a sweep for   the week; Nan-chan did it better lol. </div><div>  <br />  In news on Twitter which help liberate political topics from Trending because   Elon Musk is a genius and predicted that the list was controlled by   politicians in Japan haha what,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1589558283941003264?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >Natsukawa Shiina did a live premiere on YouTube yesterday</a     ></b   >  which is a first for secluded money-driven (lol) talent company and music   label MusicRay'n because not did   <a     href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1589558528083218433?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"     target="_blank"     >they add in a live audio commentary through Twitter Spaces</a   >&nbsp;(in where she bumped the mic lmao) so mobile users had to sign up for   YouTube Premium to listen to both at the same time haha and even if you did   watch live you'll just listening to the Twitter monologue ALSO they kept all   in archive for at least a week if I didn't hear wrongly just because so thanks   and good luck trying to sync those together not live,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/toyotamoe/status/1589940559900454913?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >Toyota Moe's solo album has been successfully funded</a     ></b   >  well past its goal which will now include   <a     href="https://twitter.com/toyotamoe/status/1591611810851033089?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"     target="_blank"     >three new cover songs and a 32-page photobook</a   >  without bikini lmao go see her past,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1589996414184079361?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >Natsukawa Shiina's upcoming live release will also be on music       streaming</a     ></b   >  and has revealed four songs ahead of its official release end of the month wtf   is this generosity haha, RYTHEM member <strike>Neat's</strike>  <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/neatsyui/status/1590306176100872192?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >Niitsu Yui's new album finished recording</a     ></b   >  which sounds like we are going to have a great 2023 with her buddy yucat   releasing a solo album too,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/rythem_official/status/1591038156362899457?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >this week's nostalgia on RYTHEM</a     ></b   >  is their final single back in 2010 about goodbyes and I'm glad I didn't   understand the lyrics to give the melody,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie_staff/status/1591355117604728832?s=20&amp;t=bC5C056qcWBo6H5j8bIRmA"       target="_blank"       >Takahashi Rie's 2nd EP will be released early next year</a     ></b   >  which includes that song and music video which brought me to my knees with   that cuteness lmao okay me relax, and this one is the saddest one yet because   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/kano_2525/status/1589467985026355200?s=20&amp;t=q1oZWzjXsFISYayqAqHZGg"       target="_blank"       >Anime "Uzaki-chan" split single with Kano and&nbsp;MKLNtic CD release has       been cancelled</a     ></b   >  (yes, not postponed) which also means the only way to hear them is through   music streaming with the latter artist's releasing end of the month instead.   Man, first time I've heard of this even in my 15 years of Klassic Note, by the   way. I don't want to guess what happened   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1589563248587988994?s=20&amp;t=q1oZWzjXsFISYayqAqHZGg"     target="_blank"     >but I did so</a   >...<br />  <br />So next week we have an empty week on our hands until we have to deal   with more Anime theme songs of obligation haha, but maybe by then we will have   <b>Humbreader's new album</b> appear on streaming sites, maybe   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/yellow-flag/1537337490?i=1537337494&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >something from Natsukawa Shiina</a     ></b   >  after listening to her live yesterday which I barely did lol see previous   paragraph, from the other live festival I've seen too   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/waves/1612623480?i=1612623481&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >one of DYGL's new songs</a     ></b   >  for the year got me in the relaxed feels department so that or maybe I'll   listen to   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/left-of-the-century-ep/1558787951?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Electrico's new EP from last year</a     ></b   >  just because I recalled this Singapore rock band was a thing and they came   back to dump their music library on streaming AND released new songs, and I   might just <b>tune in to some more Hitsujibungaku</b> if I have the time. Not   going to check all the boxes until then though, no promises as always I   haven't started on the latter yet. I also finally finished updating the   <a href="https://klassicnote.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank"     >Klassic Note official website</a   >  utilizing the new stuff on the web hosting service I'm using lol, so be sure   to check it out!<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Hey, I hope you guys had a great Sunday because I did despite leaving the   house TWICE today against my will. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, can't always stay at home   gotta expose myself to the outside world once in a while. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways,   see you guys next time then, I hope something here caught your interest even   if that means no one ever walks into here, and until next time... I'm learning   more about web UI/UX... at work hehe they won't know. Haha I just need the   time to make changes to my GitHub Page though... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. I still CANNOT believe that off all places "BLEACH" at least this final   arc is streaming on Amazon Prime Video. And coincidentally yes, I have a   subscription but not for this purpose it was for a Twitch Prime sub, but damn,   now I can watch this anytime on the go... if I install the app haha bandwidth   doesn't matter I have a cheap data plan hehe <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
