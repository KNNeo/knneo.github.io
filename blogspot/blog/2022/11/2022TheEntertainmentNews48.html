Ugh my headache is acting up again <div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, welcome back, it has been another week, we have more things to cover   this week because the new "ToniKawa" OVA is out now, I can see the "Takagi-san"   movie in the distance, so this year is going to end well, regardless of the   company sponsored Universal trip. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Then again, probably not going to   enjoy coasters with my head in a lull and without a girlfriend so </div><div><br /></div><div>  ANYWAYS to the anyways in the previous paragraph I need new phrases, so if you   have any suggestions hook me up on <strike>Twitter</strike>  <strike>Hive</strike> <strike>Mastodon</strike> Twitter (dammit I'm not that   cool yet), let's get this train wreck going! I've slept the afternoon   yesterday to prepare for this and had a cup of cappuccino for breakfast so I   <i>think </i>I'm ready lol </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BLEACHTYBW07">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "That's a monster that appeared in Soul Society long time ago" <span title="*wink*">😉</span> It's       the old geezer, young Kyoraku Shunsui haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay, gotta say, the full flashback from a thousand years ago is really cool.   Like, not inside original work real cool. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> No really, and that's why   this final season of Anime is fantastic just from this new episode   (#BLEACHTYBW07) because we can show off things like the Gotei 13 Squads from   some time ago. And I know they won't explain much apart from Unohana <span title="*wink*">😉</span>,   we know there's a Shihouin in there so Yoruichi's ancestor, we know there's a   Kenpachi <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, we know there's a Kuchiki so Byakuya's ancestor, probably the   most <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a> one   in there. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Of course, the attention was about the old man and even   then he's not that young, and boy why is Sasakibe here?? Maybe that's why they   got rid of him first. ANYWAYS, RIP to both of them lol the latter won't have   time for a funeral so I hope you're okay with cremation old man <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> but we   know he can't be cremated just because (not going to be in this Anime,   unfortunately) so let's move on. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, can we just appreciate the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shinigami" target="_blank">shinigami</a>  appearances- Wait, did I just say Ichigo was coming to save them? I didn't,   right? I said "not" Ichigo? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah yeah so haha, apart from the despair   we are seeing in front of our eyes as the battle quarters of Seireitei is done   to ruin, we got a nice flashback to justify Yamamoto's death, I guess. Showing   off what happened a thousand years ago without putting this as canon material   sure was a treat, and seeing young Kyoraku before his *ahem* own flashback is   also cool, I guess. Okay, hot, because that picture. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> The   Sternritters started bringing in their soldiers which ironically were stronger   than the shinigami side ones which really made me think if Yhwach was right in   saying the soldiers on the good side are already weaker these days which yeah   maybe some of them even ran lmao, they were real discrete in explaining Akon's   fall by a Sternritter and even then that dude lasted for about 3 seconds haha,   and Ichigo broke out. Out of sheer will, I guess. But not really, as Yhwach   fought him for a bit and yes the previous episode don't matter anymore now   haha this is better, Ichigo did not die because of two reasons. Firstly, his   Blut Vene got triggered. I would assume the Quincy leader is right, that   Ichigo absorbed some of Kirge's powers to subconsciously awaken his own Quincy   powers lol more on his mother's story in about 20 episodes lmao, and with that   it made it easier for him to break out of the absolute Scrift power we   mentioned a while ago made by the Sternritter J who is probably super dead by   now haha. Anyways, Byakuya did ask of him to save Soul Society, but not like   he could which brings us to the other point of why he is still alive and not   joining in the precession with Yamamoto but as a human: Yhwach's time is up. I   shall not elaborate that too much since it will be soon but let's say his   powers don't last too well outside of his palace, so they had to leave. Why   the rest of the gang had to join him I'm not sure maybe the Shrift powers   won't work with his presence in the shadows I assume, so everyone else left   with him, leaving Soul Society is quite a shamble hopefully with Unohana maybe   being able to conduct some funerals apart from treatments. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Man, this   is a sad episode, I can't make jokes here. But yes, this is the recovery arc   of the season so far, our guys are beat up real good and who knows what   happened to Urahara-sensei and Orihime who would've healed the old man's left   arm lol, and let's see who else will appear to help them then. We are not yet   reminded of the legendary Zero Squad from where to access their quarters one   would need the King's Key as mentioned by Aizen some time ago, so   <i>maybe </i>we can form a red carpet of blood to welcome them soon. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>   Hey, it's hard to make jokes when Byakuya is breathing his last breath, okay?   I wish I didn't remember that he "died" at some point lol okay okay spoilers   over see you next time for probably a more light-hearted episode because I   hope you remember this is also a comedy series at heart despite all the   killing or else why would be we have one of the old Gotei 13 be cute and have   a rack- </div><div>  [Interesting fact: Ichigo fighting against Yhwach is basically him fighting   against his sword Zangetsu because you know,&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/37/Takayuki_Sugou" target="_blank">same voice actor</a>&nbsp;haha]</div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOSerBDciErlE0W45ofCafzy0KxR4JKzJOgKFNrp5ZALR0cbaycq4up8Vare94htHAt-KzFrSsTWOOmzs2WIsMdyHSlsrQ7_1ZR-7mn2aGFNlhTX8Xv3IkyElxMvo_vhDb-tuHn6arIx_EAtZBjo37HOw5WZR9js9zrk16V4D8Mxt_nZG4WJ5Gs_t0/s320/bleachTYBW07_picture.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        The legend that'll burn the world, by the way       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUjPrsppkDmF9wAxmM91zK5beJ0o6NZiOAypNPq5o06u6ZmXYG_G9oEVau-UDaCu1uWDtcTJYqm7aEuJqCjR-aiVZrRtlYWJ_eN_OO8nUiPSIriJGJQ4o9hzCeu1ULuazjpd9iO6mV5Iz4l1j8ATkQbZEotv9Izl3TdfKGKRE7UIeXxay-7IumxMGJ/s320/bleachTYBW07_yamamoto5.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Billionaires after they have had enough of money lol advocate time baby       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div><div>P.S.

I know there are those out there but I'm good. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Never,   guys, NEVER let your girl compare. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where looks   like the Uzaki family is going out for an outing after the kids exams are over   (#UzakiChanS209), and thank goodness Kiri doesn't want to go because he   doesn't have anything else to offer anyways. *BOOM* Well, I mean a rack so   *BOOM* Haha let's move on, the others went to the... water park I guess? Yeah   just, I think Fujio-san here has problems driving. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Maybe we should've   called a cab. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, ask yourself if organizing family trips is as bad   as this family, because reality check though when's the last time everyone in   the family hung out? My mom just left today with her friends overseas so   *shrugs* Anyways, let's talk about the Uzakis then. They had a great time.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Wait, is that it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, don't expect me to describe what   they did because mainly if you didn't get the hint this is a PR stunt because   surprise this place actually exists in Japan thus the warning about how   seasonal changes will change the baths anyways, but hey, all of those are real   by the way. And that's why living in a tropical city sucks. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyhow,   we got all the stereotypical family happenings in here: Son refuses to go   lmao, daughters get picked up by random guys who aren't Sakurai and Sakaki   haha, mom also gets picked up lol ah hey I'll go for the mother just so you   know and it's not because of the voice behind, the foot bath we can skip   talking about lest this place gets flagged haha, Fujio is doing his trainer   work even at the park because now guys are picking up on him to advice them on   how to be as ripped as him, and I guess Hana-chan did leave the group a bit to   then coincidentally meet with Sakurai and Sakaki who are also there by chance.   Gotta emphasize, nothing to do with the mascot and KUSOCAT lmao what is that   anyways I really thought that's something like Ami-chan in disguise, nothing   to do with Sakaki planning for Sakurai to appear in her life once again...   pure coincidence. It said so on the script so it must be true. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Also,   we've already seen Ami-chan half-naked we're good. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And I guess the   main couple is chill now now that they got to talk to each other and agree   that Sakaki is in their way lmao. All in all, short write up because I really   don't know how much longer to talk about any of these already, as I'm just in   awe this episode looking at what, muscles and boobs alike? Hey, tell me this   is not a porno haha uh oh getting flagged liao noooooooo </div><div>  [TL:DR; "Sugoi dekai!" &lt;= Not talking about Uzaki Hana, by the way   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>]</div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">       <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgh5N-Vf4hCI4lTs2cxNlHE80FhK-WX0jBF2GaQA3OY6Y1uV4oJwFdFbDIOQ_sdN57ozlSaqtMUqbSeP2A4LYfhYGvruZRrwHGvYe3C9qcP1Zesdc0NKJG5prlL-2krwbQOhuJot8gI-0IO-2ca9_WGcjoWesKIGyvbYacHDl5YdxwbHdlNTSGcMiZU/s320/uzakichanS209_car.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Must they make an Initial D reference??

Haha okay this is   *ahem* so maybe not, satellites aren't invented yet. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Anyways, we   have another story to unfold, but ironically it didn't take long for me to   even find out what happened maybe because of the hints that were present from   the time it started, I assume. The servant who visited the Consort today was a   Lady for one of the consorts who died some time ago, and thought to seek help   on hearing voices from the lake as with the water taken from it to wash   clothing since this particular servant was situated at the palace's wash   house. Story goes though, that she was in this plight mainly because of what   happened to the consort she was serving. In short, she was helping her get   into the inner palace and when finally the back then emperor (so I assume this   is not even the Dowager was in power) decided to visit the premises,   thankfully did not get to see the consort in person because well, she drowned.   Damn. *ahem* Anyways, so the Lady thought this might be due to her wanting to   come back to haunt her and thought this was part of the thing where someone   dies but refused to move on. So you see, from my experience watching this   *ahem* we know that one can't just die and be done with it. Yeah, you gonna   have remnants unfulfilled. So can we stop burdening our dear Jusetsu and-   Welcome back to this review. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But it didn't take long for the Raven   Consort to notice a few things that were weird about this particular case   compared to the many we have heard of. Firstly, people did know well about   this Lady. The people in Jusetsu's abode hardly know of the requestor, and the   eunuch serving as her guard found out that, well, this Lady passed away. Well,   which is why I thought my eyes were seeing things haha didn't know technology   can make me experience that but I guess I was right, the illusion of seeing a   skinnier figure at the lake already brings the question of why this was   drastically different from the human form we saw knocking at her doorstep.   Next, flipping the logic. So turns out this isn't that surprising, that as   someone who has raised the Consort to her place but seeing her take her own   life instead, was probably more in fear of her returning to take a grudge   against this old woman instead of have other issues moving on like whatever   she did to the dirt where the blood of her supposed love one was beheaded-   Period drama, by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, turns out, it's just her   suspecting things too much, getting old and dying was part of the procedure,   and ironically which I assume Jusetsu was just thinking on behalf of the God   on her, which I guess keeping that spirit down by the lake might be a better   idea than destroying it, I guess. Good guy Jusetsu... or is it? Besides her   having great friends and now someone to write letters to ie. the emperor-   F**KING PENPALS!!! We've reached yet another level of friendship lol. Yeah,   looks like people outside are thinking that this cushy role of Raven Consort   might be taken too lightly at this point because damn, is the last part   riveting. Yeah, I don't know why, this is probably worse than the vengeance   felt in that Lady. Damn. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Wow hey as I mention every week, this   series has not failed to deliver stories that touch the heart, and provide   even more depth into the mysteries of the powers and life of the Raven   Consort, and I could not be more hyped than the emperor to know more. Hey,   looks like this is what will end the series formally, so we shall see what   other sorcery others can come up to pit against the Winter King. Oh, bringing   back the dead? You can't do that, bro.

Ask away. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So uh... in this long awaited special episode   of this wonderful marriage series which we are still in season one I guess   (#ToniKawa14), because what better way to promote the upcoming second season   with another episode, yes? This time around, not surprisingly, it's about   cosplay. I mean, you would think this is nothing special, isn't it? Hey, if   not for finding even some way to distract the husband from work (lol why   though) and also because the TV quiz apparently did nothing to stop Nasa-kun   here from creating a database haha... So yeah, this motherf**ker doesn't do   algebra, he just takes the aggregate of possibilities like doing probability.   Damn, AI brain, this Nasa-kun. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Also he's right just use simultaneous   equations, so if A is the mom and B is the kid, then 4B = A and 3B = A+4) (And   yes you can put these in an online equation solver lmao 2022 BABY) And yes,   the other question's answer I learnt from YouTubers playing that Mario Party   minigame. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sorry for being a nerd let's move on who gives a sh*t about   math and literally three women who want to answer them before the guy does   also this isn't a punishment thing, but I guess Charlotte did trigger the main   topic of this episode first so why not. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Apart from the fact that the   maid uniform changed colour lmao I assume this is just another set of uniform   the maid had... yeah I guess this did work on Nasa-kun real good. Problem is,   unless you can heat his brain up enough for it to overheat which apparently   considering he hasn't drunk a sip of water in front of the camera it would be   safe to believe this guy is not human or has an internal cooling system which   might be his small dick- It would be safe to think that he won't do a blowout   like many other Anime characters out there because he would just kiss the   bride anyways. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Aaaand we lost. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Upon asking of more of his   fetishes though lol this series only has one male and he's Yuzaki Nasa lmao,   we also found out that once again, these two as basically high schoolers never   went for dates like normal high schoolers do because they are special. They   are already married to each other- Okay how are we going to follow up on the   joke like this? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But you know, after being convinced by Aya-san (aka   Sumipe but as a bossypants) on both sides, I guess we can see more cosplay   because why not, right? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> RIGHT?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, I didn't write the   script for this episode and charge money for this in Japan for the DVD, the   producers did. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (Yeah apparently overseas viewers can just pop in on   streaming services while Japanese have to buy physical) But serious talk   though, we all expected the last part where they make... out... and kiss   thighs apparently because that's the guy's fetish or something. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Overall though, can I even complain about this episode? I mean, if you   wondered why the reviews out there can be negative, it's just they don't like   cosplay. Period. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Not that, but yeah, the pace is slow and almost   feels like just slice-of-life and I guess they are leaving the actual topics   in the next season, so this is just fanservice and you won't be missing out if   you didn't watch this. Or maybe you will miss out, I don' know. Depends on   whether you like maid outfit or school uniforms haha I just want the voice   actress herself to do this- Yeah, she did NONE of this EVER, by the way. Not   even her upcoming self-produced photobook is going to have any of the cosplay   shown on screen. None. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Haha we got no swimsuit here so she wins IRL I   guess- <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> This series is just perfect "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2026/Hayate_no_Gotoku" target="_blank">Hayate no Gotoku</a>" author you have outdone yourself once again hehe </div><div>  [TL:DR; "What better way to distract a man than with a charming girl, yeah?"   Yeah Charlotte, you right <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> "You gotta know what cosplay your wife can   wear to keep you going when the times comes-" O~KAY haha ah hey]</div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEt08DlUY1Go5X5epmZ1UAx2Q8b4xKpOrf3ppoRHb0o6YmLGH_jNmTMQ-ehRM_HhPQJLZZLCESSo2yIoisbyDhlcoKHPH8ItBL2pzbuiyba5zZflD7lygrwRRvRsPrir2ff3pPYJZQVfqVRV0Q8GCyXh10QWbV9y-Qzw4FcAuzb-KSAImhWuYxzhNH/s320/tonikawa14_aya6.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        "It's just free real estate dude" says the producer haha       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjARS9tCgID43AT_tHzndWzo-T97ABF2aFfY2D48swI6AYLdXyVib4WCWQS4BdwyELmDQnFFkNz0mogxa1mAtBrD9guowql1rStqxo1zQtl02vICLNkFIXbdQMnQLULsYaBNJSOAc2W3M7hWeiNjLDAErwhDznnhWnNxfoK8h2Nqx2QSGwHJ0Odb3Sj/s320/tonikawa14_reveal.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I like how we can somehow see the outfit already lol       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div><div>  P.S.
