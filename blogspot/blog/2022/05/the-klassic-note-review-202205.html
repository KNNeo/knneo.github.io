<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2022.05</h2>

Really, this   package is still earlier than the previous one that shipped out of Japan a   month ago. </div><div><br /></div><div><span title="*silence*">üòê</span></div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay never mind let's talk about happy stuff, yes?

Thanks to Anime "Komi-san" though, it's no   surprise I may end up with similar artists under the same music label as   independent artists from the previous season but despite her being referred to   as solo Anime artist, and considering it's her 10th time coming with singles,   I would like to mention that this is a good single. And I'll talk about why.   Here's a hint, fanservice isn't everything... maybe. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Ao 100 Shoku [100 Colours (of) Blue]</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Today I meet you again, 1cm at a time, falling in love   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    (The) usual times I touch (your) shoulder, 1cm at a time, (the) love wavers   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Your gentle heartbeat I have been listening always"   </div></blockquote><div></div><div>  A delightfully good song is probably how I would describe this Anime opening   theme song in general, because despite it making a weaker impact in melody   compared to its predecessor for Anime opening, its easy listening melody,   interesting intro and outro, and specifically I would like to emphasize the   Anime-descriptive lyrics are the best points of this song I can think of. I   know Miku isn't exactly specialized in hype songs her songs are normally   softer, so this is rather adequate for the mood as a potential love song with   all the cringes from the Anime, but also, suited to her own solo music style   and singing so far. </div><div>Rating: Interestingly Above Average</div><div><br /></div><div>(2)&nbsp;La-Pa-Pa Cream Puff</div><div>From the second verse:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">"The soft sun spreads, step by step</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">(It) will show you the way</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Shown to (you) is (a) model</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Because (we shall) proceed Charming(ly)"   </div></blockquote><div></div><div>  Don't ask me how the title of this song came about, but it won't take you too   long to understand how cute this sounds, and especially for a B-side it'll   make a better impression than the Anime theme song as A-side. I have to   shamelessly say I'm strangely attracted to the lyrics which is just about   cream puff with maybe a hint of romance, and how this song is overall   presented. It piqued my interest the first time I heard of it, and I don't   think this can get any cuter considering the softer vocals we are dealing with   too. The only grime I have of this song is the usual bridge part which I must   say isn't good, but otherwise this is a catchy melody that you will remember   its charm. </div><div>Rating: La-Pa-Pa Average</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: I have to say even in the most unbiassed opinion I can, that this   is still a good single. I know I might have been captivated by the softer   vocals, the better song compositions considering this is an Anime-related   release, but also I would like to be reminded that my tastes in recent years   may have geared me to like this release more than I would hope to. If you   aren't a fan of Itou Miku before, I have a feeling she might be your new   secret admirer from here on. If you are a fan though, not that I have much   experience but I did hear some of her earlier songs, and I would say this is   definitely up there as one of her top releases of all time. Whether it will   stand the test of time though? I wouldn't dare to say, just like how Komi-san   wouldn't. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  (Yeah okay a**hole me La-Pa-Pa your head stop writing such casual reviews as   if you like Mikuu haha; Also DO NOT EXPECT ME TO QUOTE LA-PA-PA as lyrics   quote above I still want to talk about music lmao) </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <a     href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj57ySdWOu3zbPzXAcJSZ1hoQm9FmkaRtdybrRAvGYrvKWrWhbcbfGPL_GQ69zQMX5C7u9ciUsu72aF-H-buFgMM2e6qMHMEyBmC4wzA8H6WnnHzCVHDXDn7Cw2VhQAFPa_25vIXWugLZzkMLHj2XwBnEjWPd22K-vfHvCT6373k-kNLu5bQOYyDED3/s4032/PXL_20220519_121812630.jpg"     style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"     ><img       border="0"       data-original-height="3024"       data-original-width="4032"       height="240"       src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj57ySdWOu3zbPzXAcJSZ1hoQm9FmkaRtdybrRAvGYrvKWrWhbcbfGPL_GQ69zQMX5C7u9ciUsu72aF-H-buFgMM2e6qMHMEyBmC4wzA8H6WnnHzCVHDXDn7Cw2VhQAFPa_25vIXWugLZzkMLHj2XwBnEjWPd22K-vfHvCT6373k-kNLu5bQOYyDED3/s320/PXL_20220519_121812630.jpg"       width="320"   /></a></div><div>  And... it's just another CD. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> What, you want me to talk about it   more?

My neck really hurts and is running on those   pain-relieving balms now and Mikuu can't really fuel me for that long so I   shall stop here. I'll keep this on check until the next post, so don't worry I   won't just abandon her like this. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Definitely bringing in fuel and   hope for the package that SHOULD be here weeks ago during the holiday season   but oh well, we can but wait. Just like how I waited to review this but don't   worry, the next review(s) have already been decided, if you seen my Twitter   account. It's Anime theme song season baby!
