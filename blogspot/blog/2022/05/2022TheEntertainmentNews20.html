Still no packages to unbox, huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, might as well do more Anime and video games haha ah hey it's never too late to finish that Kirby All Star Allies game from 2018 okay <div><br /></div><div>  So yeah I'm in Discord now- Well I am already in tbh thanks to the one friend   who told me to talk to him there so we can play some Grand Theft Auto Online   together years ago. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I kinda miss those days haha work sucks lmao   okay okay me stop thinking about that for another day please </div><div><br /></div><div>  Now I'm really worried about that one package which should've been a sequel to   my birthday celebration... three months ago and is already delayed for a   month. Someone send help haha I just hope it's fine I don't want to do   insurance just because I lost that Lynn photobook first press limited edition   bromide with the bikini- Yeah yeah also Rieri fanclub subscription I am   officially one month behind now haha really should've remembered that before   making the decision to ship via... ship tbh lmao <span title="*dabs*">😎</span><br />  <div><br /></div>  <div>    Okay, enough of intro for now, so Anime! And music, we can talk about that     this week.   </div>  <div>    <br />    <br />    <br /><br />    <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoiS207">      <div style="text-align: center;">        <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span         ><span style="font-size: large;">          Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita. Heart</span         >      </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote class="tr_bq">      <div style="text-align: center;">        "We're not in love or dating or anything like that" Yeah okay         Kanade-chan this is a ROMANCE series lmao       </div>    </blockquote>    Hell yeah after celebrating whatever Himuro's confession to Yukimura? We can     have more good news, Kanade-chan. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Hey, I wish I was that dude,     okay? In this new episode where yes we call that "Kanade love power" now lol     thanks Yukimura for such a scientist-derived name haha (#RikeKoiS207),     double date I guess. So yeah, surprise to no one, we can't be expecting     Torasuke to be accepting of his childhood friend... yet haha, so Kanade and     her boi I guess. Along with these main two who are supposedly in steady     phase? I don't know, look at previous episode and tell me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah,     total 10 couples, huh. Ah hey, what they DID NOT tell you, is they used     Kanade to experiment. Okay, not the way you think, just... you know,     Yukimura did say Kanade was the most convenient, just like how she can just     go out with a dude who confessed to her- Moving on haha, we are not going to     measure the overall entertainment I got in Kanade-love units lol scientists     be like, but we are going to talk about what everyone else did to follow in     the general likes of the two who are the alpha couple target to oversee this     one date. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Confused? Let me explain in layman terms. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We are     also introduced to new characters besides Kanade's boi which I honestly     don't even care because he's even less important than the teacher they     bumped into lol that might be the problem with her anyways, but yeah, we     have Tamaguchi and Kamiya which I assume are juniors in the same school who     somehow agreed to this experiment? Haha it's&nbsp;okay she may be unhappy to     be in this but I TAKE TSUNDERE BITCHES ANY TIME OF THE DAY lol I mean it's     not really that and Aika too but she belongs to Torasuke so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So     firstly, shopping for clothes. We have the guy changing clothes, we have the     girl changing clothes and wants to drag the guy into the fitting room lol     Chris, we have the girl who gets upset whichever clothes you choose lmao     that's actually very normal, and we have the guys recording data for some     reason. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, you know who they each are. But yeah, don't get     affected by the crowd effect that is trying to get Kanade-chan to flirt with     her new boi haha not happening by the way. Next up, we bump into our     ex-boyfriend- Wait, is this legal? Not every couple here will have an ex     though I mean look at Himuro. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, dark times for Kanade-chan,     and no doubt we will get back to that and I rather not, but yeah, we can     move on to more interesting things, like the rooftop scenery at night.     Everyone be flirting, it's almost abnormal for Kanade to not be- Okay it's     their first date I understand, but it seems like everyone else is taking in     the scenery quite nicely. Or boobs, whichever girl comes first. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Hey,     Kamiya, I feel bad for you now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... you think Kanade has     psychological issues? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, probably changed MVP to Kamiya-san this     week because of her behaviour to be honest. Oh, and I meant both of them.     <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Also, because Kamiya sounded like Ede-chan haha it's not btw. My     wishes for getting laid may never get fulfilled even in the near future, but     I'm just glad this Anime has all of those so I can still bask in imagination     as if I have one haha here's hoping for more of the new characters I suppose     I can use cuter people who don't have high school teacher love issues haha   </div>  <div>    [This is the highest amount of images I've stitched together so LARGE IMAGE     FEST!!

Haha did I just summarize this series?     Let's see if this week's jokes hold up to this definition. Firstly, the     school food store. Yes, there can only be one of them. Yes, it's always     crowed because despite the illusion that people make bento to bring from     home, there are still hundreds who don't have such luxury and have to buy     their own even if it's a pathetic     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/meronpan" target="_blank">melon bread</a>    for lunch. Yep. Welcome to Japan, everyone. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What did get Aharen     going later on though, is the arrival of the dog to bring her triple tower     lunch box to her lol, and don't ask how Tobaru-sensei is feeling if she saw     that piggyback in the canteen. She probably went to the infirmary like,     twice. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Then, we play Old Maid. Well, let's just say it's card game,     because clearly Raidou is unclear of the rules. Everything he pulled out of     his brain is not working to his plan, because even Aharen with her lack of     facial expressions is winning this pathetic dude lol, so let's just move on     and save him the shame. As I said, this is Nishikata but he gets his own     consequences... Wait, isn't that the same as "Takagi-san"? *shocked* Haha     let's move on. Ignoring that chair carrying thing and whoever that old dude     is carrying old Aharen lol, next up, CAN WE STOP PUTTING TSUNDERE TRAITS ON     TWELVE YEAR OLDS?? Can we stop doing that, Anime? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I just like shy     girls I don't want them to call the cops on me- Speaking of Futaba-chan     haha, she sucks as cooking. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She doesn't really want to admit it,     but hey, at least she did ask Aharen "Michelin one-star" Reina for     assistance so that's cool, but ended up just not making it again because kid     don't know food will spoil after some time. Ah hey, we can't anticipate     everything, Akkun. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Last but not least, can we have someone sell     that life-sized Aharen Reina doll like, for real? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really,     serious question haha. All in all, just another episode of laughs,     definitely the pace is better than last week's even though we know the     bullsh*t is happening as Raidou explains his strategies in that Old Maid     game, is not going to get me more if they don't come up with new shticks     which so far they are still doing so I'm just glad I don't look as bored as     doll Aharen-san haha   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR; "But I have to anticipate a variety of scenarios or I won't know     what to do if something unexpected happens" This episode NOT in a nutshell     haha if you get it you get it]   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="180"                   data-original-width="320"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWoL1H9rvo8rxns1o_8-_kp2xgGjw7XgDWYlpQYSGx_ZWNj6_KpeaKzmHV5UXqf0nSP4VHNG470YoSmlDiUNKXbsA5GQtI_nzTY19I0fM8ih6blwa-KgDONdXQSdVzHc_eYyHyntSLjRmIhHo_K2GbvhRQgeXSjaFFDmtXQQVriaTBwIIXlRakLNQu/s1600/aharensan07_fall.gif"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                Me after work every day haha I found the perfect GIF               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNJ_m-WQ_sacZLPYILjLwWhefpshSiolktc59hrv1p8rX8XZFMh-XDzZtfWgeyULaddpTzjhv8-_4Glm_Q-UPmCYOHsYi5fU9iLib2eAOW9ZqRRhz500ZEElVGo-YKJBEvOfW1HvJ8QlMFt6bB9hEn7TtD5RoZJqX9enh2sWYP4UyoF4TpEGUELLSO/s320/aharensan07_art1.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                If I didn't tell you what was the context you would think this                 is a great piece of art               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcxJ0C6Vt6TgdJzU1GksYPtnC5YBaH2f4M7y9bIU2VBFjbtQvSkBaPFJZVGI8DOJM4oYRGc_IxijX8GK-WFT9cEDcV2WbrkrOU8cNUf-0VCqQEdZjySkKT7pLk52y3c5szBM3-GHdfrC2S84SX1MQK1J-QMbLpMXaes2BrzNgpsisyCetAYJxPihV4/s320/aharensan07_bed.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                This only gets weirder every other episode lmao               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    </div>    P.S.

Oooh can we not have Kaguya's dad appear? Please?     Haha in this new episode where we get to see them parents again     (#KaguyaSamaS306), haha I love this lore I don't mind them parent     interaction right here haha KAGUYA'S PARENTS STAY AWAY FROM THIS WE DON'T     CARE EVEN IF YOU DO NOT APPEAR <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ahem anyways, parent talk. Hey, I     didn't expect this part to be so entertaining, so let's talk about it.     Introducing Hayasaka's mother Nao-chan (lol me) who is also here to be     parent for Kaguya just because     <span style="font-size: xx-small;">we will not dig too deep into that</span>    but let's just say it's just a guardian duty because who has time for their     kids who are going to be future housewives amirite??? *OOF* Anyways haha     gotta say though what was with that band intro, is that Shirogane's dad DOES     have time for his future daughter-in-law it's already on btw she's halfway     in this lmao, so besides asking how far them kids have been going at it (you     know, sexually haha), he also doesn't mind being her daddy every once in a     while- Anyone even noticed how cute Hayasaka (Ai) was in this episode?     Seriously, let her change her job; She will be infinitely happier as a     person. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But with this parents meeting session we also found out     what likely will be the conclusion to this season maybe, that Shirogane     (Miyuki) has chosen to go overseas to study with a recommendation from the     principal himself in this very high school. (You think Stanford knows about     Shuchi'in? lol) Hey, really, if it's time to make a name for your own     family, that time is now. Though I would argue that will mean ditching your     girl here in Japan but who cares that b*tch can't even take a hint- Speaking     of hints haha, the Prez thought it'll be good to ask her out... to go visit     another school's festival to prepare for their own or just for them to have     fun in it, but yeah, despite their subtle advances they couldn't bring     themselves to say the word "together" which ended up in a deadlock worse     than relational database transactions- DATABASE JOKES!! <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> So yeah, real     problems in this series right there. As they say though, them student     council people attract their own type just look at Ishigami stuck at     confessions too. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah also, Shirogane himself wants to know.     Like, know himself more. Because you know, we are BLOODY THREE SEASONS IN     and he still has no idea IF THE GIRL LIKES HIM OR NOT Jesus Christ someone     send help for me. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, again, the other girls in the council     are not helping out as much or even anything, maybe because Fujiwara has     known this guy's lack of ability to even serenade to a woman or maybe he     should be removed of his vocal chords lmao, and Miko-chan is what we call an     idealist because unless you are already taken you are likely to have the     same ideals as this girl right here thinking that the perfect guy/girl     exists in real life- They don't. Stop dreaming. Just admit that someone in     your life who is still single might be your type. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Yeah reality     check there, me) But yeah, no surprises there how Kaguya may not have     anything to criticize on this perfection that is his crush- All in all, SO     GLAD Kaguya's parents are busy may they be busy till their death lmao <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>     (Please do not insult your parents and love them and not leave them in the     lurch, me)&nbsp;   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR; How to get Hayasaka Ai to be cute: Step 1 - Summon the mother.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also hands up if you want to pay for this parent-level comedy in     this series like Hayasaka's mom lol]   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5mOzc_bT_whXZbLOOj_-lDjM5FtW7RAWRu99JtD_5ugxRi4jBdr1gO46HMGnu_KgrUVMhE-YcMDMVmwyBaqDcf-tJxkwrD4brB2q9o51UrxA0hW_R56y4imBQbBEgZ6DolJaQ7O8ko_I7QEPrq3_GIKUxO1ntI1XrBabNOtJh_qH-BoflA2FQsqeF/s320/kaguyasamaS306_girls1.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                Gotta say this Hayasaka combination is so cute I can't even               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKrQUbh1d6S5KXciiPyFqwO6dfV4WNKYaY1Dqf5PkSLvjkb8KMYjLTql4MoHHtb1xLmOiheL54r_e4ohTA3OW39UO33lqo2Bt2nkyt1N37FUFX7WSaQd1VCiu-4gSUdWAcMS_zSIkEcL7vIkSGp36UeqcrUGPro4qsHdtRdfSBRd1y4c-RZ8a8Dt0W/s320/kaguyasamaS306_parents.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                I saw this as preview on the official Twitter and I'm like "what                 is happening" but now I know haha<br />(And they are still                 better than your real parents-)               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    </div>    <br />  </div>  <div>    P.S.

I don't look that hot.     <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Welp me I guess lol in this new episode (#KomiSan18) where we try     to find everyone after the new year has happened ie. this year I guess haha,     we also get an insight as to where everyone is with their lives... besides     those who just hang out at the fast food restaurant just because lol. Based     on Najimi and then Tadano's call order to go to the shrine for     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hatsuhinode" target="_blank"       >first prayers</a     >, Yamai is enjoying her holidays in beautiful Hawaii which says a lot about     her love for Komi-san because     <strike>why isn't Komi-san with her</strike> why would you go overseas when     Komi-san is in Japan lmao, we destroyed Nakanaka's experience in her video     game's new year event haha, Agari choked on mochi lol, Makeru-chan lost to     her brother haha that's a surprise to no one we should never have a reason     to lose to this lovely girl who can't admit defeat, we invited Onemine's     brother out instead haha and also remind me to get his sister to call     Otori-san or else she might be still stuck at last year haha, please don't     call Katai-kun he's deep in training, and we can't get Inaka because     reception on the countryside is basically zero. Oh, did we miss someone?     <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Somehow we did miss someone actually, as seen from Katai's lack of     engagement with his new buddy Tadano lol he tried to get him out again but     for ice skating which despite him knowing nothing of it and thought that'll     be a great idea, also really thought he'll have a good time with him... as     long as he does not bring Komi-san over. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, what can I say, we     need some gender balance here I can't stand watching too much skating action     between two dudes. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I SWEAR WITH THE     OPENING THEME THAT WAS A GAY MOMENT REFERENCE- Anyways haha I guess Katai     did have a good time and someday Komi-san will voice out her jealousy for     them dudes being dudes... or not. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I know right, just slap your     dumb boyfriend head- <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Last but not least, and I bet you this is the     best part since the start of this series already, is when Tadano falls ill     but gets NOT Najimi for help. He's at home alone, he felt like dying, and     what better way to find meaning in life again than     <strike>call your childhood friend</strike>    <strike>call your girlfriend</strike>&nbsp;call your favourite classmate by     mistake. *<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tehe" target="_blank">tehe</a>*     And so he did, this half-dead dude haha, but really, do you think Komi-san     won't appear after hearing you in literal pain? So yeah, really, REALLY     shouldn't have called Najimi afterwards. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> But oh well, before they     appear though, you be glad that Komi-san did drop by your place to give you     some sustenance and I don't mean by kissing <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>, cooked up a meal for you     so you feel better just by tasting her cooking which I must say Yamai is     still in Hawaii so she won't know of this greatness lmao, and I wonder what     else Komi-san decided to do after tucking her boy in bed.     Hmmmmmmmmmmm.......... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also Tadano, just chop your hands and let     her feed you, you idiot- All in all... come on the last part is the best     part, right?? Even the sister knows. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> If not for Najimi, really. IF     NOT FOR THAT PIECE OF- So I guess next week we'll start with Episode 1 of     the new spin-off series... starring whoever that Anime dude is so STAY TUNED     for that where- Oh you don't know about this? That the main series has     ended? Yeah, we're done haha new show next week I guess lmao them female     fans of this series are WET haha what is with the next episode preview     though I assume this is another dude who will be into Tadano for some reason   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR;

Ah! Summer things to do after what was         that, the river? lol       </div>    </blockquote>    Okay THIS has got to the actual summer episode, right? Like, compared to     whatever we got last week of a disappointment? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode     where we continue the vibes of summer despite getting sunburnt lol     (#ShikimoriSan06), we go to the summer festival! Yeah, not that I've been to     one before, but you know, we do the usual stuff. As they get dressed to go     there which I guess Izumi can't wear his dad's jinbei because size     difference really, but what's stopping Shikimori from going to meet Izumi in     her grandmother's yukata... with some help from the brother because     seriously who asked for his help. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But yeah thanks to the brother     anyways, we get to see yukata Shikimori which I must say looks real good     even after seeing the other friends appear at the location too (but I gotta     say though Nekozaki with the black yukata is also kinda great haha ah), we     get to see all of them play various games in the festival location including     having all kinds of food which at this point Hachimitsu and Inuzuka is still     eating them all lmao and we also found out Shikimori doesn't like sweet     stuff hehe that's cute, the shooting gallery to Shikimori is for losers     because she just cleared that guy's stall haha, and we almost missed the     fireworks because Inuzuka challenged Izumi to a goldfish scooping     competition lol. Ironically on this as Nekozaki mentioned, Shikimori fails     to win against the classmate somehow due to her stare haha I mean look at     them poor fishes, and the other girls decide to help her get her couple     moment by making this their own competition lol, then ended up not being     able to reach a good spot to see them fireworks likely because Shikimori     broke the strap of the sandals but also in case you wonder why people only     suffer feet injuries at a time where it's been years since you ever worn a     pair of those rough sandals that'll get you bruises if not worn often. Hey,     perhaps that was the moment for Izumi to show off his gentlemanly side as a     boyfriend finally, as he decides to piggyback his girl (weight unknown lol)     to the viewing spot his father suggested instead. Yep, all the way. Now that     Izumi has redeemed himself as best partner in this series lol sorry dad, we     can talk a little bit about how much Izumi was totally right about Shikimori     trying to put up such a perfect image in front of his boy. We also learnt     how Izumi did NOT take her out the year before just because he didn't have     the courage to. Oh well but hey, at least there's this year! So screw last     year and let's have a good time not tripping going down the stairs- Yeah,     you also didn't realize that Izumi was literally blessed by the gods until     this very moment, yes? Really, I thought he couldn't have made it out of the     house. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Thanks yoked dad for the save, because to no surprise, the     parents were there all the time lol what telling you a dating spot doesn't     mean they don't go themselves, isn't it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all... I hope the     shooting gallery's owner and his thoughts on Shikimori did not trigger any     dark lore we might have been hinted on because seriously? I rather just bury     those deep underground with all our world's nuclear waste just because.     <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Other than that, I wonder how much I won't get bored of this     series even if it's just date after date- Like, we need more Anime like     these, I can't emphasize more where IZUMI is the cool one haha can't wait to     see what you have up your sleeve next sir haha get it because yukata sleeves     <span title="*dabs*">😎</span>   </div>  <div>    [Oh just as a reminder: This series will delay by a week and be     <a       href="https://twitter.com/anime_shikimori/status/1525528367214338049?s=20&amp;t=1CT8-AzTJ9eIxOtZFi91uw"       target="_blank"       >airing special documentaries instead</a     >    due to a recent announcement of infection within the animation studio so     this will end mid July.
