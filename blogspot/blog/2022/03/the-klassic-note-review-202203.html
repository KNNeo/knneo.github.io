And damn, damn, damn do I have more artists I can talk   about in reviews now that they have become popular and came in under the   spotlight. Hey, the more the better, isn't it? This time around, unlike   artists which target specifically me so female artists, we have a male group   here! And a male band dedicated to singing songs for women? Happy   International Women's Month, by the way. See, I'm an advocate and this is not   a coincidence </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span       style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"       ><b>音楽</b></span     ><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">SHE'S - Blue Thermal [Single]</div></blockquote><table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="300"           data-original-width="300"           height="300"           src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/01/45/TYCT-39170.jpg?v=1"           width="300"         />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img           border="0"           data-original-height="300"           data-original-width="300"           height="300"           src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/00/20/TYCT-30128.jpg?v=1"           width="300"         />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table   align="center"   cellpadding="0"   cellspacing="0"   class="tr-caption-container"   style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >  <tbody>    <tr></tr>    <tr></tr>  </tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div>  (I mean, The Regular Edition cover is a bunch of balloons behind a punched   hole of a thin wall behind a layer of plastic and bubbles? Artistic, to say   the least) </div><div><br /></div><div>  Origin: I have to say, I should thank SHE'S for bringing me closer to feminism   than I will ever be with their music. Being soft with their music but bringing   impact on everything they create, they just tend to exude a little more of   those feelings from the female perspective better than any other male   artist(s) could ever within the industry, and I applaud them for that. Their   style also brought me to like them more than ever since I knew of them five   years ago, with singles to love and album to please. This recent single is no   doubt just credited for the animated movie of the same title, and I can say   this is the easiest way to exhibit how their style doesn't fade when being   associated with credit, as they are still being able to stand on edge with   their music. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Blue Thermal</div><div>From the first chorus:</div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">"The pains that pierce the heart</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Draw the curves that the wind carries</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    Admiring, riding and overcoming, flying up high   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">(I) will take you along"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div>  As you might have figured out from the lyrics, the song sings about flying in   the sky, ambitions to soar in the blue world above us, with power and with   company. For having inherited the song title from its credit, it's hard to   think that it should be more relatable to the show itself, but surprisingly   they are still able to create such a good mood out of it, and I admire them   for that. For the melody, it does borrow the vibes of epic tunes they have   written over the years, brought in with impact and with much love. Overall a   nice package for a song you cannot screw up on, and hearing it more just makes   me feel guilty for preferring their classics over this. I also managed to   watch the music video premier on YouTube on time, and it paints a blue picture   of teen hope and courage as a statement to follow for the movie. </div><div>Rating: Beautifully Above Average</div><div><br /></div><div>(2) Beautiful Bird</div><div>From the first verse:</div><div></div><blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">"I know,I know,I know</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">Seeing (my) footsteps</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    (The) Things enough to make (me) afraid and unable to proceed   </div>  <div style="text-align: center;">So I walk,I walk,I walk</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">I walk straight without a stop</div>  <div style="text-align: center;">    When (I) see you that was what (I) decided"   </div></blockquote><div></div><div>  This song... this feels like a song of praise. Praise them birds, or praise   them braving the skies... this song feel like a song of encouragement, once   again, with company. The emotions are strong on this one, which really made me   think twice the first time I heard of this. Its simple melody and impactful   lyrics did leave an impression on me, and with much thought I accepted it and   gave them praise for making such simple yet nice music once again, as they   have been doing all these years. The English in the lyrics just make them   stand out a little more than you might imagine. </div><div>Rating: Simply Average</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: This is a perfect single to show how great SHE'S actually is, and   I encourage you to give them a listen. I often say that if you can like at   least two styles of a band you will love them, and this single has both of   them. Of impact, and of emotion, these guys handle them all gracefully and   with style. What more can I say? I am sure coming out from watching the   animation this will bring an even greater impact, but I don't even need that   to know these guys gave it their all. </div><div><br /></div><div>- Aozaki Shouhei, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  (Yeah, I know right?

Yeah, back in   January. So.. maybe it was a good idea to listen to new songs early after all,   eh? I could've gotten this signed, man!! </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <a     href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj5P_YI6GDThERDS52cqWdbAtn77zcl21M2GcSRi3otdsjCPTxSr7eIHvxDfOgVBK_4Y2K20I5DC0f7qCHUt_CLdN7YscxleICGP3DGz7GTBlTNHFI0fqzjBhdC5qHuTAuphHNR6NQH2QTAK677tHeGN6WXk2qd_r73btVbfuFW3_mkKqyrcU9fdbvI=s4032"     style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"     ><img       border="0"       data-original-height="3024"       data-original-width="4032"       height="240"       src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj5P_YI6GDThERDS52cqWdbAtn77zcl21M2GcSRi3otdsjCPTxSr7eIHvxDfOgVBK_4Y2K20I5DC0f7qCHUt_CLdN7YscxleICGP3DGz7GTBlTNHFI0fqzjBhdC5qHuTAuphHNR6NQH2QTAK677tHeGN6WXk2qd_r73btVbfuFW3_mkKqyrcU9fdbvI=s320"       width="320"   /></a></div><div>  So! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Never thought I'll buy a SHE'S release, so here I am thinking of   what special gift I should give myself after missing like, a great opportunity   to get a signed something haha it's fine. And because I have been buying CDs   to fill my shelf for nearly a decade, I went back to my "hometown" CDJapan aka   Neowing because (1) they are one of the first to know to internationalize   their store to make me buy stacks of CDs back in 2012 without much friction   and (2) still offer reasonable shipping rates despite only literally buying   this one disc. And it comes with a free postcard of the members too! What more   can I ask for? </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <a     href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbmT6IR5PcOoiN_qhX19lnd8gwxpnCsvDCPEPE0ILm5viL8XygSmAeJqiPJb73GaIXh6IXbOme7MfBhUqSVlIKxdY8rCagK7bkV3KS5mD_G8NhT4pb1auxXgj-m_jojcJnteEdJKCG6uHGRIF2lHN8RwuypGMB6wJNLLWM2OoTPzBUFdPLsbG6LxN-=s4032"     style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"     ><img       border="0"       data-original-height="3024"       data-original-width="4032"       height="240"       src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbmT6IR5PcOoiN_qhX19lnd8gwxpnCsvDCPEPE0ILm5viL8XygSmAeJqiPJb73GaIXh6IXbOme7MfBhUqSVlIKxdY8rCagK7bkV3KS5mD_G8NhT4pb1auxXgj-m_jojcJnteEdJKCG6uHGRIF2lHN8RwuypGMB6wJNLLWM2OoTPzBUFdPLsbG6LxN-=s320"       width="320"   /></a></div><div>  Okay, maybe not the animated jacket enclosed in the booklet because who cares   lol </div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  And that shall be it! As I ignore my dad walking into my room asking what have   I bought lol what does he know, I continue my journey talking about great   music I've found in Japan where people abandoned them for whatever popular is   in Korea now because who cares about those. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, I may have some   plans for the upcoming months, but whether I will fulfil them or not, it's   really up to me. Come on, me, do it for KN15YEARS. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> See you then. </div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
