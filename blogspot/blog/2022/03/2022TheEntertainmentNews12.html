And that's assuming I haven't seen the season preview and I already know of "Aharen-san" AND there are THREE OTHER SEQUELS IN THE SAME SEASON wtf dude who do you think I will choose between <a   href="https://myanimelist.net/character/136359/Kaguya_Shinomiya"   target="_blank"   >Kaguya-sama</a >, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/141790/Shouko_Komi" target="_blank"   >Komi-san</a >and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/165457/Ayame_Himuro" target="_blank"   >Himuro</a >from "RikeKoi"?&nbsp;<a   href="https://myanimelist.net/character/150916/Reina_Aharen"   target="_blank"   >Aharen-san</a >, by the way, nice girl too haha you will find out how right I am in three months <div><br /></div><div>  Anyways!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Talking about Anime, the weekly <strike>chore</strike> post   is here again, but I'm afraid, me, that we have more to cover over the next   week because of the impending fate of the upcoming package dropping... really   soon as in tomorrow so we shall see how to space that out since I have to   work. </div><div><br /></div><div>  So me, how do you intend to watch the "Heike Monogatari" series if you can't   even deal with the length of 3 episodes every week? Well. the write-up is   shorter I guess haha maybe I should stop doing this-<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan85">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;">        Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span       >    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "There is no plan. We either wipe them all out, or don't and lose the       flying boat"     </div>  </blockquote>  I know right, Annie, stop asking Armin for a plan we all wished Erwin was here   to make a decision lol then again he may have drunk that spinal fluid wine too   so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where we try not to kill people now this is   the pacifist episode lmao (#AttackOnTitan85), we notice how desperate Gabi   just wants to kill. Like seriously, girl, you okay? Falco, you not worried she   will kill you in your sleep when you guys are married? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways,   story. It was a mess. Traitors all around, you know what I'm saying? Haha I   meant the title of the episode, very appropriate. In a nutshell, the gang here   knew that Floch's team is just threatening the Hiizuru people to cooperate   which they likely won't so people are just slowly dying (shoutout to the   engineers I look like that IRL and I'm not even under threat lol), so they   don't have much time to think. Armin and Connie thought it'll be better if   they stayed away of this or even try to not kill any of their friends who took   the wrong side, literally up to Annie's expectations, but as they argue,   Magath encourages them to take in the fight. To end this war as stupid as it   may seem. Like really, when will this end? I meant like, we going for another   season or...? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, looks like everyone's joining in to say the   least lest Gabi has to do it herself lol you freak, so they start with bait.   Floch probably already knows this so Armin's plan technically failed, but   suffice it to say Armin and Connie managed to walk towards the flying boat   which was of course guarded and rigged to blow should anyone like them appear,   even if they are friends. Well, they almost got it I guess. Almost. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   But I guess they knew already, so Mikasa and the others were ready to strike   if Floch did not go along with the plan of releasing the flying boat. Oh well,   so much for trying haha. So yeah, they are the traitors I guess, I don't know   who's betraying who already it's a mess just like the Hiizuru ambassador   mentioned. Everyone tried to hide into the basement for cover so Titans can   start roaming in the area which Reiner and Annie did covering each other's   backs so they won't be blasted in the nape, and Armin got shot a lot. Like,   why-are-you-still-not-transforming a lot. *OOF* Connie did his job as a   soldier and took out his friends with total regret... and that's why you can't   have nice things. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, fair talk, the flying boat is technically   saved, but not until they get rid of all of them Jeagerists on ground. Or on   the air, yeah. So we shall see of Floch's fate next week where hopefully, we   see him in red. See you guys then. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi_KNzkB_rNV-RihaQQLMqZFQSuJeoZ0a-pWu0cIaZOVxHr7VIBYH6wcICr0RuXe7-ett-q1GCL3oKCP0ijcI36u5nIKUyLVf6Rr8Nsq6ybvHikdurwj-yJlj8tApE67cMfYvebnhhvZ3dFKjRarDvp3mgWxWBAC7X5kE34pdJGdOejKyTyM2okp7dJ=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              They look like a great couple lmao             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjvyMouAeKX0sqmf3C3GSd7SsB4fNOZzyoHIcEg2wEzrsyGVmygcJdJhja3RWrmhWETj5wQH9UC_skQGdVrV8VdUTYamxIBZPy1hk56VBniHBbrDcgtNx-ARVKn0aqU0EArb4P3Z3iP-gJe6xI8QD1DIfF7Hy71FHzR45kqZWbsSzf2Ec6znB4m3vXl=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Dude, this kid is more desperate to fight than you guys lol<br />(Maybe               that's why Gabi is the main character in this arc?)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Serious   question though. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where looks like we ending the   school year soon since Love Day is here (#TakagiSanS311), we almost forgot   that Nishikata is a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> now.   Yeah. So should we be surprised to see girls fall for this nice dude who   doesn't know people like him. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways (haha), glad he realized that   Takagi can't pull such a joke on him because   <span style="font-size: xx-small;">why would she make herself jealous</span>  HAHAHA so! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, in a nutshell... I think Takagi is not real. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Wait for it, for I can explain. I mean, Nishikata probably also felt that way   too at some point to be honest. So yeah, it started with Nishikata seeing   three boxes in his shoe cabinet, the place where all students have a certain   slot to put their shoes in. So... yeah. Can't believe we are at this point,   Nishikata finally got popular, wow, and probably will get Takagi jealous. (I'm   not referring to the song, no way) (Haha) With the world around them   prospering even if it's Nakai-kun getting chocolates from his girl, to   Hamaguchi getting whatever dark chocolate from Hojou making him think he's   likely not the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmei" target="_blank">honmei</a> one lol I   would to to be honest, gotta say everyone's having a great time even Nishikata   is leaving his old buddies behind haha. But yeah, it got stuck in his head.   Like, how popular he has become after the school festival. After all these   years, he finally had a chance to shine. It was so great, even the girls   walked into the classroom to find him. It was perfect. The best tease of all   time to even Takagi. And... it wasn't for him. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> No really, I thought   I foresee the planning for season four it's going pretty well so far with the   female   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kouhai" target="_blank">kouhai</a> haha but   uh... maybe not. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What is real though, is literally only Nakai's   chocolate because we know he's the coolest only second from Shibasaki whoever   that dude is lmao, Hamaguchi's one was the right one and probably the only one   to be honest because Hojou is a shy girl in essence unlike Sanae (lol don't   beat me up) she did try to make chocolates but screwed it up so guess what   happened dear boy <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>, and Takagi did visit Nishikata's shoe cabinet   this morning. Hmm... what do you think happened in this part? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Remember how throughout this series we have focused on showdowns and teasing   all along? What if you found out the truth was otherwise? Would you still be   able to... give your dear boy your chocolates? I guess unlike Hojou haha,   Takagi had some problems. And here is where the wholesome part comes in, and   despite the initial tease lol shout out to all the sardines out there, Takagi   did do the thing on Valentine's Day: Give his boy some sardines- Okay, give   his boy some chocolates for real. Yeah, Nishikata, get a grip, THIS is the   reality, not those younger girls lmao what does it take to be cool amirite?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, great episode, love the twist and appreciate the lack of   Takagi's tease and increasing Nishikata's imaginations because notice how   quiet Takagi was thinking of ways to get him to meet with her in private   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>, we also have a hint to what was to end this season. So thanks,   Hamaguchi; I'm pretty sure Nishikata will confess to Takagi earlier than you.   HAHAHAHAHA cya guys for that miracle I guess but why is my mind telling me it   can happen </div><div>  [TL:DR; Did I mention about how Yuuki Aoi who voiced Hojou was such great   romance material? Can I talk more about it right now?

Gojou maybe sweating because he has never been   closer with a girl than ever before, but Kitagawa is just gyrating at the fact   that she is with the guy she likes so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode where we   find out life's mistakes just after we decided on them like how I did last   night with my order lol that's no joke btw (#KiseKoi11), we see Gojou getting   excited with another cosplay. This time around, he may have to think twice,   because besides the nice setting of some devil coming to make sure you sleep   at night and I totally would instead of being that dude who just can't stop   writing his novels lol, we, uh... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Where shall I start... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Firstly, if that is not obvious enough, is how much the cosplay will show   skin. I mean, I don't know how Gojou would be okay with this, but he did say   yes to it despite Kitagwa mentioning how much it wouldn't fit her size and   build but yeah not wrong, so they went with it. That's fine, until they wanted   to find a location for the photo shoot... and ended up in a love hotel. Yeah,   sorry, Gramps, I'll leave your grandchildren in there in case you want some.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, I meant condoms, we won't be wearing any of those we be putting   them in our wallets so we can get rich!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (But seriously though,   that's how women know you rich 'cos you be fuckin') (lmao) So yeah,   intentional mistake I might add, but coming from Kitagawa she should know she   would have a great time since the rental is soooo cheap anyways lol, but yeah   might as well make the most of it. And they did. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> They did not   disappoint haha because despite them trying to do cosplay and technically   enjoying the luxuries of being in a... hotel room lol with the TV that can   only watch porn and a bathtub big enough to sit two people... <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> You   get what I mean. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And also also, Gojou coming up with his imagination   considering this is a low sketch easy read&nbsp;<a     href="https://jisho.org/search/yonkoma"     target="_blank"     >4-panel</a   >  manga with little details and he had to come up with something this impressive   because I wonder why I haven't get laid with such a succubus myself. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Jokes aside, we still have more lol, these two definitely did NOT try to avoid   all the stuff that couples would do if they were in a love hotel room. Yeah.   That. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, totally upscaled when guy literally asks girl to be on   top of him. Like, DUDE. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as you would expect, everything went   perfectly because besides the perfect cosplay shot, he also managed to- NOPE.   NO, NOPE. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't worry that didn't happen or else they can't air this   on national TV but that bulge, man... I just can't explain man, natural   instincts? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, thanks for the phone call by the way to tell   them to get out, but other than that I think they had a great time, and I'm   still surprised how Gojou hasn't fainted yet with all that blood rushing   towards his crotch.

That, after that   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1503346445893611520?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"     target="_blank"     >long deliberation of my journey on Twitter</a   >  which you should absolutely take a look, I ended up with Sans, and besides   being a video game character's name, it's also... basically just a bunch of   guys born in the 80s making new music. But I gotta say, it got me, so I   basically gave   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/sans-ep/1611515377?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Sans' 1st EP</a     ></b   >  a listen which released actually this month. Yeah, no joke. And their 2nd EP   is in production. They really don't have a lot of audience, so man if you like   their dance pop style be sure to give them a listen. Pity about the song   length though, like, Cwondo doesn't even make songs this short lol. Moving on,   I got read bored after giving these which means apart from Sans because the   rest are real bad haha, I went to Skream and then found out   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%8A%E3%82%AC%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9C%E3%82%B7%E3%83%88%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3/1611491338?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Spira Spica's new album</a     ></b   >  is out this week too, so I decided to give it a listen. Problem is, I don't   know what songs to give since none of them left an impression which no   surprise, is typical considering their subpar skills in creating songs to   remember. And I am not joking, Anime is the thing carrying them by the way.   Anyways, I'll decide on that before the releases next week, I hope.<br />  <br />  This week's news on Twitter we have:   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1503294872010207234?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >ClariS released a new song</a     >    and     <a       href="https://twitter.com/ClariS_Staff/status/1505241842522427393?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >two music videos</a     ></b   >  for their upcoming album with the latter being real life remakes of their   original songs sung by we know who they are so I shall not comment lol,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/riefuofficial/status/1504966467309109249?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >Rie fu's new live video</a     ></b   >  of the week is also song I liked which is also an Anime theme song if I'm not   wrong, it's time for   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1504804824797360129?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >KANA-BOON's debut on THE FIRST TAKE</a     ></b   >  and they start with a popular song which got me into them featuring the   bassist from ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION   <span style="font-size: xx-small;"     >because they lost theirs if you would recall</span   >  OOF lol and   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/_kanaboon/status/1504050213975367680?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >their new music video</a     ></b   >  is a meh but might be their best song in the release haha,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/horieyui_staff/status/1504432800950554627?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >Horie Yui's new lyric video</a     ></b   >  is for the upcoming album releasing next week,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1504312041309306882?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >SHE'S appeared in a livestream festival</a     ></b   >  which isn't bad at all you just have to skip through all the other artists lol   I did listen to some of them but you know haha,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/sonymusic_EPIC/status/1505382478474723330?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >RyokuShaka's new song</a     ></b   >  is for "Crayon Shin-chan" lol can't wait to see the music video for this,   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1503656506532990979?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >TrySail's new live videos are fitted with 360 degrees audio</a     ></b   >  so be sure to put on those headphones and don't be an idiot like me and listen   on speakers haha, and   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1504065190815416324?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >THE ORAL CIGARETTES' teased a new song</a     ></b   >  to release digitally next week which... eh when's the new album though.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, and be sure to see   <b     ><a       href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1503736809351626752?s=20&amp;t=IKtNBw1mfEwoeig3RmqLVw"       target="_blank"       >my review of SHE'S new single</a     ></b   >  where I talk about how good they are not just getting a female audience.   <span title="*wink*">😉</span><br />  <br />So for next week, we have a couple of albums to listen to which will   curb my... lack of satisfaction listening to indie artists from last week haha   yes Spira Spica included. There's a long awaited   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%B5%B7%E8%BE%BA/1609048239?l=en"       target="_blank"       >SID's new album</a     ></b   >  which started from them signalling their return back in 2019 and man, will I   enjoy this even though I know the new music video did not impress. We'll find   something; I need emotional songs for the Song Awards this year haha. And as I   listened to the album preview, I will also listen to   <b>Horie Yui's new album</b> which man I am just glad she is still singing   dear Hocchan, and I might just give a couple os songs. But my bet is still on   SID; We know each other too well to be able to give more... I hope the past   few releases aren't exactly stellar in my opinion lol the album preview isn't   that good haha<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Man, it's such a good time to just chill to songs every night instead of   having to bear the burden of watching either livestreams or YouTube videos-   Kanno Mai's Instagram Live of the month was soooo good~ Haha okay why am I   deceiving myself here everyone should be doing livestreams every month I will   be watching them every day. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Cya guys next week then, and we know next   week is going to be hectic in this blog because my actual birthday present for   the year is here <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>, so yeah be sure to check back every day as I   slowly but surely update what I find meaningful in my life right now.   <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I even doubt myself on that so we shall see haha playing mobile   games and working does suck the life out of you and I wish someone would take   care of me just like how those   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186184/Haruko_Saeki"     target="_blank"     >onee-san</a   >  do in Anime haha I don't watch IDOLY PRIDE FYI lol bye<br /></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
