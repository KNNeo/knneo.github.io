No really, there are other romance           series to watch on this list if you can't take a cute bear voiced by           Asakura Momo telling you what the Travelling Salesman Problem is lol         </li>        <li>          The only new series I am definitely watching in here is           <b             >"<a               href="https://randomc.net/image/Miscellaneous/Spring%202022%20Preview/Aharen-san%20wa%20Hakarenai%20.png"               target="_blank"               >Aharen-san wa Hakarenai</a             >"</b           >          [Premieres April 1st 2022] because besides the main girl Reina being           voiced by Minase Inori, this series is from an adaptation of author of           "<a             href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san"             target="_blank"             >Denkigai no Honya-san</a           >"           <a href="https://twitter.com/mizuasato" target="_blank">Mizu Asato</a>          which goddamn that 2014 Anime was really good, is back with another           romance series of a girl who can't gauge distance for heck. Like, if           we put her in this pandemic with safe distancing measures, she will be           scolded by EVERYONE for violating the rules lol. So yeah, you can           imagine how bad it gets, but what is hidden in bliss and sitting           waiting for you to enjoy, is how nice the series will be as Reina-chan           here is a nice girl, and to the people around her and that dude who           sits beside her in class. Yeah, this gonna be good, so I have no           qualms taking this in.         </li>        <li>          Like seriously, you have NO IDEA how many sequels are in this most           densely populated season of the year haha         </li>        <li>          Wow can I continue to comment how many of the new series are even more           boring than what I see a decade ago?

I'll think about it, maybe           I'll take a look. The only thing I can recall is that in response to           the title, is that the girl is basically the guy in the relationship           to that dork of a boyfriend lol maybe I shouldn't watch it after all           (Also also, Oonishi is known for voicing not her own natural voice           which I actually like so... yeah try "<a             href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/48849/Sonny_Boy"             target="_blank"             >Sonny Boy</a           >" if you can take its weirdness)         </li>        <li>          I thought I initially would be interested in           <b>"Kakkou no Iinazuke"</b> as the stellar cast and crazy familiarity           with the theme song artists (Ikimonogakari's vocalist Yoshioka Kiyoe           sings the opening for her first solo artist single, and           <a             href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1505844940936425473?s=20&amp;t=iMBXU-sn5NqtFq5ajicjdQ"             target="_blank"             >Sangatsu no Phantasia as ending</a           >) would have reminded me of this series some time ago, but looking at           the review it looks like something similar to "<a             href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/18897/Nisekoi"             target="_blank"             >Nisekoi</a           >" which I actually didn't like and probably "Koi to Uso" too but           yeah, polygamy is just different from whatever this is, indirect           incest? Can I even say that? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I've gotten enough to being with           Kitou Akari but Kohara Konomi though...? <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Maybe not huh haha         </li>        <li>          I swear <b>"Joshikousei to Mahou no Note"</b> looks like a PR           nightmare waiting to bloom until I also saw that it's made in 3DCG           which... uh...

The planet will be gone       within a week! Oh well in case you wondered how the dinosaurs went       extinct... <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode where all plans don't go to plan       (#AttackOnTitan86), looks like we need another plan to catch up to Eren.       And holy shit, this was a good episode. Let's talk about our heroes this       episode. Haha ah by the way, we gonna have a lot of those till the end.       This is war we're talking about, many are going to die for the cause. So       why not firstly the ones who stopped Connie and Armin? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah hey,       just saying. But upon knowing that setting up the boat to fly will take a       lot of time literally days and there is NO WAY these guys can fend off the       Jeagerists plus reinforcements with literally loads of missiles on their       waists, they may need another plan. The Hiizurus suggested instead to       service the boat offshore but in Marleyean ground, and that will guarantee       the fastest departure of the vehicle, but will require a sea transport to       there, and of course, some time to get the ship going because this is       still the coal era and we don't have electric start-up that takes seconds       lol. Still, the enemy is pressing on the attack ensuring the departure       doesn't happen, and the two Titans can hardly hold their ground for long,       so let's talk about the real MVPs here. Firstly, Falco. Thanks to him, the       gang got closer to making this plan B work in their favour. Because he had       that Jaw Titan power very recently, it was against Pieck's suggestion to       transform even at this point and I'm surprised how he isn't crying over       poking his palm till blood comes out <span title="*pukes*">ü§Æ</span>, but suffice it to say that       he did it, his first time and many more until he dies in a decade and a       half lol, but yeah definitely did help to stop some of the soldiers along       with the Cart Titan. Problem is, and yes this is the first time we       witnessed a first transformation, is that your Titan instincts will not       stop you from snapping out of conscious, which is why it takes another to       hold him down so Magath can get him out forcefully. Good to know, new       knowledge here, by the way, and it doesn't even require a flashback. Next       up, we have the sniper. Thanks to him, he single-handedly got rid of the       train sending reinforcements of Jeagerists down to the port which is       *chef's kiss* why did they come in in enclosed train cars so they can't       run away in time lmao, Floch missed his only chance at firing a missile at       the boat, and helped the gang proceed as the ship took off steam so they       can leave safely without interruption. And his name is Shadis, the one who       also saw them take off in the cart back then when Floch took over the       land. Last but not least, <strike>Connie</strike> Magath. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Please,       you think you can make me think Connie is cool after all those action       kills? Give me a break. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Magath volunteered to stay back and fend       off the remaining enemies because (1) he noticed another ship on the port       which is a Marleyean cruise and can catch up to the other ship which he       intends to blow up it seems, and (2) get rid of the remaining people while       he's at it, luring them into the ship and then make magic happen.       Interestingly, Shadis was here to help because thank goodness for not       sniping Magath down lol, and they went off with a bang. So yeah. salutes       to the two that died and one that lived for even till this final season I       kept thinking Levi was the coolest, but I think we may have to put him       back a bit for now.

Don't you have a problem where we need to do a double       confession to different girls with your bro? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey Hamaguchi, I'm       not trying to be a piece of shit but you have some weird ideas in your       middle school brain. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this final episode of a series which       refuses to graduate lol (#TakagiSanS312), you think the graduation will       happen first or the confession? I'm betting on neither. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also, I       guess we cursing on Hamaguchi too, huh. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But really, Nishikata,       just let him do the deed, clap hands and then bail; You'll be fine.       <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Okay let's talk about what really happened on White Day. Because       goddamn, this is quite an ending. Remember how we talked about how they       one-up the previous season? Okay okay, no rush. Let's talk about what       Nishikata did to prepare for White Day. Apparently, a lot. Again, just       like Yukari-chan said, the power of love, man. He made up a puzzle quest       for his girl, leading her to the ultimate gift of probably the chocolates       he had but was waiting for who knows when to give the girl, but problem       is, Takagi won't be back from her family trip to a relative's wedding       until the 14th (and I don't know you can take school leave to do that       haha), and was then even more delayed due to the harsh winds on that day       itself, so yeah, Nishikata literally can't execute his plan at all to just       give a present to her. But we already know she can solve all the puzzles       anyways just as how the girls trio managed to do it beforehand and       <i>then</i> realized it wasn't for them because the dude placed the first       clue in the worst position possible, on the chair of her desk. Oh well.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, moving on to the actual confession, of Hamaguchi, to       Hojou. He gave the chocolates. But just like a wimp he is, and I was       totally ready for it too, he didn't say it. So yeah, how dare you not do       this considering it's       <a         href="https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/1507870346162339841?s=20&amp;t=RxfUQS351TAE2PXDLrgaTw"         target="_blank"         >the voice actress' birthday</a       >&nbsp;today, you idiot. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> And he thought his buddy would do       better than he did? ...He's right though! Because allow me to emphasize       the wholesome moments we have seen in this season alone, right at the end       of each episode, a moment to treasure between the two. So after Nishikata       realized in the library that his girl told him a lie about reading off a       confession from a book, he then noticed, even for a moment, that his girl       has been confessing to him all this time! You know, it's like propaganda,       but with confessions. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah hey, I'm not the smart one, she is.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, literally tease master at her best attempt, but this       time around, Nishikata did not hesitate. So despite the ferry only coming       in late in the afternoon and his efforts to track her down, his run down       the road was finally noticed by the girl, and... again if you expected a       confession I apologize in advance on behalf of the staff, because you       gotta remember there is a new movie release dropping by this summer so...       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Yeah nothing to do with that since this is an adaptation anyways       and I don't think the author intends to end this series anytime soon so we       not getting that. Hey, but they held hands! Nishikata did say he missed       her, and went through this much to give her a present. I mean, I never       even went through the effort of wrapping a gift for my girl so... yeah you       win. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, GREAT EPISODE by the way thank goodness I       watched this last on the list today lol <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> (breaking fifth wall here       as an audience btw), and WHAT A CONCLUSION to this already fantastic       series of crushes and fancy with middle schoolers. What more can I say,       really? Somehow the only bad part about it all is in the title: That       Takagi-san is good at teasing his boy. Yeah. Don't you think so? Things       would've gone SO MUCH BETTER if this love was more cohesive, but hey, it's       the journey that counts. I take this as a confession, sir, so yeah, just       go steady with her why don't you. Hehe I'm not going to expect more       seasons OR an ending to this to be honest, but hey, I've gotten two more       seasons worth of wholesome middle school romance than I can ever ask for.       *applauds*     </div>    <div>      [TL:DR; "But you know, I bet Takagi-chan is super happy!

You treating your daughter as a kid, Kitagawa papa? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>         </div>      </blockquote>      So wait, where's the jack off session?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this final episode of       a series that literally baits you like a <strike>cosplay</strike> gravure       magazine haha (#KiseKoi12), we end the season with the summer vacations!       There's summer festival and homework and everything... but no cosplay.       Yeah. Regardless, let's talk about it. Kitagawa did have a very eventful       season out there, from doing photo shoots for magazines to working on her       homework because her dad said so lol, she did everything that a student       can do for their summer vacations...? Yeah, besides going to the festival       I guess, when you aren't done with homework. Like yeah, that father is       weird she's already 15 haha, but Gojou finished his homework so what do       you think happened. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> The gal even forgot to bring her math       homework back and had to go back to school to get it while being scolded       by the guard for their casual attire? Yeah, she be living on the edge,       this girl. And then we have Gojou-kun. He finished his homework like a       good kid, hardly goes out anyways since it's hot, he doesn't have friends,       and he likes to continue his practice on making hina dolls. All is well,       and then the planets crashed. Yeah, these two. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, so much       has happened over the past few months as we see them bonded through       cosplay, so it's kinda awkward where we see this series end not relevant       to the topic, I guess. But still, I guess yukata cosplay is also a thing       haha, and Gojou did like that nape so <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> They watched horror movies       together, jumped into the pool unintentionally and not in swimsuits lol       that's a shame Kitagawa can't swim anyways, watched fireworks together,       and the guy gets to piggyback the girl because those       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/geta" target="_blank">wooden clogs</a>      got brushed real hard on them feet (unlike the guy who wears them on a       daily basis lol) so it's all fun and games for them to be honest. But most       importantly, they had company. I still can't believe even at the end it       wasn't about cosplay and it isn't       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> because       you know what happened last episode, and they ended with... I guess a       confession from Kitagawa herself over the phone talking to a dozy Gojou?       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Yeah, that's about how much romance we will get after all, huh.       All in all, I wouldn't say this is the best thing ever, we have better       stories out there, but of cosplay, this might be the best storytelling       yet. If the world of Anime is just about giving you the imagination to       what you want, then boy am I glad to have seen a fashionable girl with a       rack in real life liking what I did just because. So yeah, at least for       the interests part, I think the series did a good job on. As to how this       might be better off focusing more on the romance part because goddamn why       didn't they even kiss lmao, but yeah, it's not that kind of relationship I       guess, so we are taking the easy way out. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> I liked the series       though, so at least we will get to see if the real life counterpart will       look good after they reveal the Shizuku outfit in an AnimeJapan 2022 event       to conclude this lovely series I'll remember which is why I watched this       first. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> But yeah, feeling rather empty right now because I wasn't       satisfied with the conclusion for this adaptation, I guess. But you know,       it's about those good times, so I'll take in all of that.     </div>    <div class="thumbnail">      <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh51mM6yxkGNFZP6VZFonVjxYicSxBj8DqgChHL3uyCE54uAGTPMkM0AwD89Nz8cn9iqJfySVeiZG9RqjD720IbXcpYU7I8KgLdGqXNrstX8XVPR5rZZzEJgbWoJZzy8DWIjLoUGJ3Mof4nA_gT_XZLrHUohQ2IptIFzXlXy-Y-oGqCS9n1xlddf9b6/s320/kisekoi12_couple1.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                TFW your friend got more into the Anime you introduced than you                 did lol               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyB6LLa5AHsgl_jU6Vr3tUKvZgo1pCtzczE7zm7H4Kkbhoc0j_gD3XK9gq9Cu-mOyq6vQmnQnWJsduLJ9Dp8XVgfytJmXrT_tJpXHT2OBFVgrJzDIvrEMYPQkXvTPaD5l6L80t1dqXXu77pJyhnfdgEnA_PX-c7vBKuE8GDaqTXhdQW-ALO0x6D7p-/s320/kisekoi12_couple3.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                Normally we would have to animate how much chest is going into                 this guy's back but<br />(Haha but Gojou are they soft though                 <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span>)               </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">        <table           align="center"           cellpadding="0"           cellspacing="0"           class="tr-caption-container"           style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"         >          <tbody>            <tr>              <td style="text-align: center;">                <img                   border="0"                   data-original-height="720"                   data-original-width="1280"                   height="180"                   src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJyEePEo_Vm75cfsZzsOaPE7UGny6fdYzxnN_iPP0g_BSJcnD_GElziZv-w0kiYBrzDfSaleme8tVvK4VSnj_ZkvquGInvpfezBSo76SblVZsSFq1V-s0m-JNwWIgE1XmeXPjkIoThpwrizZSVg-cIQc1fqU1f7oEwnTodtvoHB8Wd5-qEqPkYw420/s320/kisekoi12_couple5.jpg"                   width="320"                 />              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                I know this was in the manga but it reminds me of                 <a                   href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/time-traveling/1567215457?i=1567215461&amp;l=en"                   target="_blank"                   >that song which describes them far apart but together</a                 >              </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    </div>    <div>      P.S.

Next week is going to suck mainly because I have to       go into an Army camp for not work reasons lol, so hopefully it won't be as       boring as I think and I can still listen to new songs and watch new Anime       over next weekend. Oh yeah, be sure to read the last few posts where I       simp on Hondo Kaede <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span>, got lucky with Kouno Marika trading cards and       regretted my purchase of Touyama Nao's anniversary book full of       interviews. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Good summary, me.
