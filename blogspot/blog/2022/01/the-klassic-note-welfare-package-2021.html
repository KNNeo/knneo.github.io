There are great stuff, there are   the bad ones, we'll talk all about it here! </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  (Didn't even realize I did this before Christmas the year before though, but   who cares I had a package that time so) (Hehe yeah go check it out if you   haven't) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">WHAT THEY ARE</div><div style="text-align: left;">  <a     class="azat Xj68le"     href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7691140190529873686/3978531113656693687"   ></a   >I know this is just for me so I can look back at the posts and giggle again   hehe, but yeah, this is a big picture of what sins I've done over the past   year.

   </tr>    </tbody>  </table>  <!--DivTable.com--></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Okay sorry I should've just used numbers but you know, for comparison of how   many bromides I've bought just this year alone haha also I think I lost count   at some point but you get the idea (maybe I should split between new and used   from Suruga-ya) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Unlike last year, because I think I've become numb to the prices in shipping   lol me, we shall only talk about the items specifically, and what was   different compared to last year. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  <div>LEAST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE</div>  <div>    I would say though, I hardly buy anything that has the least worth, so it     kind of ends up being the items that I was most disappointed of due to - and     there are a lot of them last year - gacha elements in getting those items.     I'm fine with badges I'm not going to be mad even if the odds are low, but     bromides though... And that's why I was real sad with     <b>Hanazawa Kana's bromides</b> in which it's her first time selling them     directly to us thanks to her moving of music labels, but then I ended up     getting all the landscape ones instead of the portrait ones which was what I     actually wanted, so really, can we just not do that and just sell all of     them in sets? Please? I'll pay more lol you'll pay more if you buy more     gacha-based ones huh haha no thanks then   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    <div>      MOST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE<br />Normally I would put this in the       least worth portion, but since you know I was a simp the moment I bought       in the <b>Kouno Marika fanclub box</b> YOU KNOW I was already pricing that       one handwritten <i>priceless</i> membership card above everything else.       <span title="*giggles*">ðŸ¤­</span> I'm sorry man, impulse buys are a thing and I don't know how to       scrimp and save. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Apart from that, if we do not talk about stuff       that costed a bomb, I would say I loved <b>Ookubo Rumi's bromides</b> so       much, my phone wallpapers this week were it, and I can't say any more how       much I want <strike>her body</strike>&nbsp;her photos so much and since       there isn't another photobook I'll take this any time of the day. RumiRumi       please release a photobook again I know you be in your 30s but     </div>    <div><br /></div>  </div>  <div><div>BOLDEST ATTEMPT</div></div>  <div>    Ah, my boldest attempt is ironically NOT listed in any of these posts mainly     because I don't have any physical goods to review on. Yes, and it only gets     worse, they both are from <u>and to</u> Tachibana Haru aka     <b>Futon-chan</b>, the only cosplayer I follow till date. As seen from the     thumbnail of this post, Futon-chan has within the year, joined a modelling     company known as "modelpress", and under that name she released a sort of     <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B09FNTY81M/" target="_blank"       >digital photobook</a     >    of her dressed up in many ways than over to please my eyes, so I immediately     bought it to support her advancement it's not that expensive anyways. *dabs*     Bear in mind that the world was on fire, and her being independent is not     great for her own career even if she does MC here and there, so I'm just     glad she is under some shelter now, from here and onwards. And if you     thought getting something from her isn't bold enough, did I tell you that I     ALSO gifted&nbsp; an outfit (cosplay? lingerie?) to her which was on her     Amazon wishlist, on her birthday over a year ago? And I didn't see her wear     it at all? (Or take a selfie and PM me? lmao ah hey I left my Twitter     handler) You don't get any returns on this FYI this is idolism at its     finest. Will I do it again though? Eh maybe not I'll just pay for her     fanclub next week haha there wasn't one last year anyways   </div>  <table     align="center"     cellpadding="0"     cellspacing="0"     class="tr-caption-container"     style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"   >    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <a             href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgxNhaaKE4EkBVAkXJUSv2O0N_X0glJOygP_KTwHIbg-wNXYKi61JHKrv_xmQiGeRMb0HnTBidSB6TG3miEeScVNZZKsynQDKpaT1plpqMPrsq1QmjWK6MRq0sgSNTOfQbkWTlpmmzXPh506tx-e8DLObtuTrdz157BNsA2s36kRa7tMUn8lznRs511=s933"             imageanchor="1"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"             ><img               border="0"               data-original-height="522"               data-original-width="933"               height="179"               src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgxNhaaKE4EkBVAkXJUSv2O0N_X0glJOygP_KTwHIbg-wNXYKi61JHKrv_xmQiGeRMb0HnTBidSB6TG3miEeScVNZZKsynQDKpaT1plpqMPrsq1QmjWK6MRq0sgSNTOfQbkWTlpmmzXPh506tx-e8DLObtuTrdz157BNsA2s36kRa7tMUn8lznRs511=s320"               width="320"           /></a>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">          In case no one believed I did this even though I mentioned it last           year, here you go<br />(No, the photobook did not feature her wearing           the stuff I bought her <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span>)         </td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table>  <div><br /></div>  <div><div>WORTHY MENTIONS</div></div>  <div>    I would argue that I should talk about also how good     <b>Waki Azumi's pamphlet and photo set</b>... bromides thing are, or even     the time I bought an <b>Omigawa Chiaki photobook</b> just because she     promoted it, but I have to say that the stuff that made me move out of my     comfort zone... at least in terms of my wallet lol (RIP wallet), was to     betray my sister and our trips to buy novelty T-shirts to buy...     <b>novelty T-shirts of voice actresses</b>&nbsp;that my sis will never buy     and is super pricey just because. *dabs* From that "Aoibito" shirt and pants     meant as a thing from Amamiya Sora I can't even, to those shirts my mom     ruined by putting on the sun for too long until it changed colour (ugh)     (haiz), there are a lot of things to say about that one bulk purchase     which...

Japan. So yes, I'm paying their 10% right now lol     don't tell my country's government. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> But in the case that changes     which it has been mentioned to encourage local purchases (Like, really? What     about this- ugh), then I may have to tone that down.   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    But until then!! Here's to more fun exploring the merchandise of Japanese     voice actresses! Or not voice actresses, sometimes I do that too haha ah     (cya guys tonight for new anime)   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.S. Thinking of bombing my bro on his birthday in March with Itou Miku's     newest photobook released a month ago in December I know his address     <i>since he asked me to buy stuff for him before so</i> I think I might just     do it it's cheaper than buying from the local bookstore somehow haha no     really   </div></div><hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
