Haha hey I said the thing, though is it the new year if we haven't hit the one on the lunar calendar? lol <div><br /></div><div>  Not going to do the Anime Extra thing for Titans though, so they will be   officially delayed for a week considering they air... tonight haha that's why   I hate Sunday Anime but what to do, I have a day job and I work on Mondays so   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br />  <br />  So let's see what the new season has to offer! Well I'm mostly watching   sequels so you tell me lol I just hope the Bisque Doll thing will be good but   I may be burnt out on romance shows so we shall see<br />  <br />  <br /><br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS301">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span       ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "This is the cool thing that the kids in athletic clubs use!" And you can       still lose to Takagi in arm wrestling BOOM GOTCHA haha     </div>  </blockquote>  I think Nishikata is me dealing with things I am uncomfortable with which is   basically me outdoors so... or maybe it's just love, you ever thought about   that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this first episode of another season of laughs where we   continue our defecation on this poor dude lol (#TakagiSanS301), wait what is   with the suggestive themes on this?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, you saw the opening   animation? What the... Anyways, looks like in summary this is the aftermath of   what happened last season with the summer festival and they held hands? 'Cos   this is quite a theme in here, apparently. We start with Nishikata's   fantasies... well dream it looks like, and yes Takagi-san it's a naughty dream   because how did grabbing a cow's tail become a thing in this? <span title="*silence*">😐</span>   (Goddamn did they put kinky producers in this now lol oh it's the same guys?)   Moving on, we know Nishikata is already missing Takagi he's dreaming of her in   his dreams, and as they meet again after the summer festival before school   starts, Takagi asked Nishikata <strike>out</strike> to guess why she asked him   out, and he got it half right... I guess? But yeah, gotta say though this dude   is getting smarter by the day even though it's still off by a lot, since   teasing is part of the lore is always an easy guess. The desire to meet   though... I'll leave it at that. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Seriously though, this hurts, just   kiss already. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then, we get to see everyone else in class. I know   technically we saw them sleep in class in Nishikata's dream, but this is the   end of the holidays where people haven't finished their homework, so yeah.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Just for recap, the guys all went to the beach but it appears to be   separately in boys and girls groups, so Takagi likely went with Yukari who is   concerned about her fair skin she's trying out homemade masks, Mina is just   totally distracted by bugs as usual, and Sanae... let's just say she is still   as chill as ever. Nishikata went with his dudes Kimura and what his name,   Takao? Oh really, I only referred to him as "bucktooth" <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways,   everyone's got the tans, Takagi be dreaming of her boy too, but I gotta say,   maybe Takagi is a prophet. Haha, to this dude that she likes apparently. You   see, if you love someone you can read their minds perfectly. Your experience   may vary. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, so close yet <u>still</u> so far. Can we change   this around in 12 episodes? I don't know, but we shall see. I feel like now   I've learnt somehow that the fourth wall ie. production is teasing me on this   series for so long, I've been a Nishikata all this time, I feel like. Like,   really, how was I so dumb to pick this up to watch back then? Well, just like   how they are going to be together, I have to watch this till the end now. They   hinted on this as their final year of middle school, so let's see how far this   goes. I honestly really want more romance than the teasing because I know we   have to fulfil the title of this series but I feel like we've had enough... or   have we? *Takagi giggles* </div><div>  [TL:DR; Imagine Rieri in the studio going "wah", just, imagine it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table         align="center"         cellpadding="0"         cellspacing="0"         class="tr-caption-container"         style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"       >        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img                 border="0"                 data-original-height="720"                 data-original-width="1280"                 height="180"                 src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhCH_yr42KpabsU007McIDWvVSQ6zhQgAfyJt-JDJ3fDL7ouiGnS4DCizg2DMig_Qlz8Tpl4pIpkcavq0jnuIcKMihCNA22388LAV8H3yqyNwbveDbxYiX9AgCMdxHpN19WH9u8rNA3zbadQwQNmdYM45S_VmznhZ6tUCALy0Hjkz0I9s-9Rb-HZTIU=s320"                 width="320"               />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              How you know this is not for children<br />(Really huh, cow               outfit?

Ah, the question that most   people can't answer from their family members. I feel you bro, I really do.   <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> In this new series I'm trying out haha get it because outfits   (#KiseKoi01), we find out that you don't need to have friends. You just need   to have passion. Just, look at my solo journey on listening to Japanese music.   <span title="*sob*">😢</span> Anyways, this is an Anime ironically, about the same passion towards   stuff only you like. And to be frank? I totally feel you guys. And I'm glad   there is a Venn Diagram where these two can meet. So, let's talk about how   this relationship happened. Firstly, about Gojou Wakana, the dude. (Yes, just   in case like me you have mistaken that given name as a female) He likes dolls,   specifically   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hinaningyou" target="_blank">hina dolls</a>  if you have not seen them, are a traditional doll design of historical origins   rather unique to Japan, and if you have admired your granddad doing this for   years since you were a kid, you would be drawn to it somehow, and that's our   guy here. I would say that talking to the dolls may be TOO into it, but look   at "Yojouhan" with that freak talking to a life-sized (s*x) doll sheltering it   from the rain and compare it to this. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I wouldn't say much about it,   but seriously as they have mentioned, it's hard to get people to like the   stuff you do, apparently also for the girl who left him because of his love   for dolls back in I assume middle school. In this world where people call you   a loser just because, we switch to the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a> Kitagawa and   her gang. In her accidental bump on Gojou's desk lol are you really okay   though (why would you put that as like, a coincidental thing?) (Ah, anime   production decision, I see), the dude ended up focusing on (her rack but also)   her conversation with the girls talking about how some dude at the hair salon   mocked on her interests in, guess what, Anime. Yep, we got a hidden otaku   here, ladies and gentlemen. Well probably not that hidden, I assume the girls   around her know about it but couldn't care less so she rarely talks about it I   suppose, but yeah, try picking up a chick by insulting on her, bro. Not cool.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> For Gojou though, he's fine he hasn't got found out about her talking   to his beloved doll head figurine OH MY FREAKING GOD. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, that's if   Kitagawa was a normal person but she's not, as we quickly find their   coincidences stack upon each other's lives pretty quickly. The episode focuses   on the dude talking about how conciliatory he is to his classmates making   others in class push class duties to him and then leaving for their own   part-time work and can you give me a cut if I'm doing this for you lol, but   yeah, in contrary Kitagawa stands for herself and wonders why this shy guy in   class doesn't speak up for himself. That didn't get over his mind for a while,   but I gotta say that's pretty good life advice we getting them all in this   series lol. Then, the encounter. The sewing machine at home broke, so Gojou   had to use the school's sewing machine but with the following assumptions: (1)   This school doesn't teach home economics so yeah I can cook fried rice better   than any of them lmao and (2) they don't have an Arts Club but have this Arts   room, weird. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> I assume we have another side story where someone is   forming   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31952/Kono_Bijutsubu_ni_wa_Mondai_ga_Aru"     target="_blank"     >an Art Club with a bunch of weird people</a   >  in it (lol sorry for Anime reference I am an otaku too haha ah-) but that's   for another timeline, but yeah, Gojou can spend all the time he wants to   making hina doll outfits without people finding out... if it isn't for   Kitagawa. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Turns out, she be spending time here to do outfits too,   this gal who doesn't know much on how to do sewing she probably has the same   amount of knowledge as me tbh, but for cosplaying. Guess I was wrong about   when I saw the trailer, but she is just into it, this might be her first   outfit, and it's... terrible. I wish I could use harsher words, but I'm like   nice guy Gojou so I wouldn't go up to her and stare at her half-naked body- Oh   yeah, there are   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> references   here, so be prepared though. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So this is where the intersection is: We   have a girl who wants to make outfits, and some dude who can do it but for   dolls for now. So why not let him teach her- Oh we not teaching to fish she   just wants fish? Uh okay, says Gojou, and thus the magical journey begins. Hey   bro, I hope you don't mind a career change because she's gonna change your   life forever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, great episode though, we might not even be   done concluding on the origins of this romance, but we are getting there, and   I'm rather pleased so far. We have comedy, we have suggestive references, we   have some moments which will no doubt come back to bite us in the final   episode, and we have Kitagawa. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I say we have a winner. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> But   seriously though, if you can get over the slightly lewd stuff around here   which is nothing compared to   <a     href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou"     target="_blank"     >living on an island with you being the only dude</a   >, I would say (sorry for another Anime reference haha I gotta write what   comes in to my mind) this is worth a watch. We can never get enough to cheesy   romance beginnings, and I think this is a good balance of all of it, with   enough fuel to keep it going. Like really, if you aren't prepared to come here   to watch more Kitagawa cosplay, you might be at the wrong place. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Just   look at the opening animation man, we don't even have enough cosplayers in   Japan to make ALL the outfits worn by this one girl in this series haha.   (Edit:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRS8Otwbo7g" target="_blank"     >the ending song music video</a   >) But hey, I'll be darned to see this animated hehe we shall see what is up   next because look at the title of next episode I can't even </div><div>  [TL:DR; This author thought it'll be a great idea to let Kitagawa ask someone   to help her make clothes instead of teaching her how to make clothes.

People listen to songs from 20 years   ago. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   <b     ><a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/kaikai-kitan-ao-no-waltz/1542572215?l=en"       target="_blank"       >Eve's mini-album</a     ></b   >  from 2020 is not going to hit me anytime soon as with most of their songs, so   I'm just giving the one movie theme song.

I really   think if people ask me about indie artists I can recommend this to them. They   be recognized by the music industry too with credited songs, so that's good,   we can see where they go from here on.

The   download period ends next month, so I may want to download again for my older   phone too so maybe, maybe I'll use the VR features again lmao unlikely I'm too   lazy to do so </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.P.S.   <a     href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1478712027912704001?s=20"     target="_blank"     >My "Alternative Girls" profile</a   >  for good measure, because even though I levelled out all the girls'   relationships the top 3 still show a pretty good representation of my   preferences haha thanks game </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
