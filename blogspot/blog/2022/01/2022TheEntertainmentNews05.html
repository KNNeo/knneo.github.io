Haha we found more Klassic Note Reviews we can do apart from     Ryokuoushoku Shakai because of the album this week, since apparently I     missed Ten-chan's too so maybe this will end up becoming my birthday package     instead I guess. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> With Douki-chan, huh. Oh well. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span>   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    Regrets aside *sings     <a       href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/regret-new-rec-version/1536317553?i=1404259089&amp;l=en"       target="_blank"       >RyokuShaka's "regret"</a     >* haha, let's talk about Anime and music! I still can't... *sigh* Haha okay     I'll get over this and who knows if a miracle will happen lol that pop-up     for gifts out of stock keeps happening every time I had to checkout from     Toranoana and it hurts me lmao   </div>  <div>    <br />    <div>      <br />      <br />      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan78">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span           ><span style="font-size: large;">            Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span           >        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "But I don't think (Zeke) you are someone who would drag kids into           this!" Oh no who cares we're talking about thousands of enemies here           bro Falco isn't important lmao<span style="text-align: left;"             >&nbsp;</span           >        </div>      </blockquote>      Is it really Zeke's fault if he doesn't scream just because there's a kid       involved in this? I mean... right?? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode where       apparently we have moral decisions to think of in war haha I know right       (#AttackOnTitan78), Zeke just screamed. Yeah. He didn't hesitate. Maybe       for a moment, but no, he did it. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> THIS IS WAR BABY!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Okay       jokes aside, let's story. Story goes we are still in war, someone shot       Zeke close to the nape I guess but didn't okay Magath I don't want to       point fingers but you could've done better as Commander lmao, and the       Beast Titan fell to the ground. And as expected, Zeke screamed and turned       all his Eldian enemies despite being an Eldian, into Titans. But not       without any resistance. Colt, who is, if you need a reminder and they did       do that, Galliard's brother who shielded him to become a Titan, brought in       Falco and shouted at the one Titan to not do it just because... one       shouldn't drag kids into this? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Like really Colt, you make of a       great comedian haha. It's war; who cares what happens to the innocent       people involved. (But seriously don't quote me on that, I may go to the       international court for this lmao) And so Zeke did it, the madman or mad       Titan whichever you prefer, and everyone instantly turned into Titans.       Colt did mention about having a range on this though, but as we have seen,       it's as far as his voice can go, so shoutout to Pyxis enjoying that wine       spiked with Zeke's spinal fluid haha hey ask any alcoholic if       <i>that</i> is how they want to go. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Falco went for Reiner who is       just struggling to juggle between letting Eren go and not be bitten by       Titan Falco or vice versa but after a second shot is aimed at Zeke once       again making sure his Titan form is beyond saving but STILL not managing       to hit him in person and getting ambushed by Armin's team, Eren just took       this chance to run away from Reiner even if it means abandoning his       current Titan form which is pretty beat up to be honest. Yeah. And before       you can think of what happens to Gabi at this point and how she can be       here with a horse at her age lmao, I just keep forgetting she is like a       superweapon in this series ever since they introduced her at the start of       this eh... season thing so from last year haha. So yeah, Gabi also had a       madman move, and aimed right at human Eren as he was seen running towards       Zeke because how else you gonna inherit his power. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> But yeah,       many things happened, it's pretty chaotic to be honest it might be the       most chaos we have seen ever just stacking upon each other, between Eren's       severed head and Zeke's upper torso to what looks like Gabi being shot so       RIP her first, we switch to the Paths again, as we have seen a couple of       episodes ago. I will not talk too much about the jebait Eren just received       from his brother, but we did learn a lot more from Zeke just sitting there       waiting for his brother to recover. Firstly, the Paths alternate world       they are in. Only people with royal blood and I assume thode who possess       Titan powers can be here, along with, surprise surprise, it's Titan       Founder Ymir herself. Why is that so? Because this is the origin of power,       so Ymir basically can heal all Titans or even make Titan powers in here,       for she is the creator. Secondly, what Ymir can do. Apart from creating       Titan stuff, she apparently can't speak, and is only here to obey everyone       else in this world, so anyone with royal blood. But what does that matter       though? This will bring us to the last point, which was Zeke's plan to       test Eren out. Maybe he knew too, right? Like, from the flashback where       Eren intentionally missed the catch of a baseball from Zeke signalling       their partnership, Zeke probably knew to test Eren out till the final       stages, and Eren did squeal since he thought he had total control. By       telling him what Zeke knows which is wrong, Zeke himself was able to tell       Eren he is the Founding Titan, but in reality, anyone can command Ymir       (sex too? SWEET haha I'm not pedo) (lol) to do anything, including, that's       right, making him those chains which he proclaims will lock him down.       Which should've made you wonder but I didn't, why that wasn't there when       he time healed after dealing with Levi previously. So yeah, I hope you       figured out earlier than me because I'm just here for the ride, but       suffice it to say, these two have to fight it out now. All in all, it       looks like whatever happened after that one moment will drastically change       as soon as we get done with this world's... whatever flashbacks or       conflict we are getting now haha. Don't ask me why Zeke is testing stuff       out, but he did have a lot of time to wait for Eren to recover it seems,       so it's up to them now. Literally. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, we shall see how this       goes. Very interesting lore so far, and I can see the hype now. Goddamn,       this might end way better than I would imagine hehe cya guys next week for       more lore because it's about time we spent even more time talking about       that after this bloodshed lol     </div>    <div>      [TL:DR; How to deceive your brother within 2 minutes lmao ah hey gotta say       Zeke is a master of manipulation in this series]     </div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     height="180"                     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjJECtw38VN6mEBefQzYwt9NdVsZbePxuy8Wg2ji9iG_WYe-NstpVeHo7B3yMgjghPwfdbOZLzRMHaehTCyiOX89AZ9nWCbNxg5MdIVee6j2Lpd1hxLtrK5iBFgjV9FAg7xgtlO2DWO2dF3Rp-5l9eXLjShHbz74AKefT2wvcuaGac7TOM30sXcWm5U=s320"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This episode in a nutshell, to be honest.<br />We waited                   literal years for this haha                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     height="180"                     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhx5PAnoM_jIRykpHpasA9arZCJO3c05lVV9p90ZeP1iq4iiVg09wKt0xyzsjQTvAYWrXl9b6Q3wD6dmYl5SdZyULMSxeKeFPJXaK43NyGaUrDxXBqX8h5Agvo2Q7kyCA05z8wplKB8_7hCy1m7cj1qtbyqMwjkZaH2kIMQfgf3zPgB47lq1kyw0ULu=s320"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  TFW you realized you drank too much for the night lmao                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S. "I'll do it. I'll put an end to 2000 years of Titan domination" This       series in a nutshell haha but hey, if we started with this it wouldn't       have been fun, wouldn't it?     </div>    <div>      P.P.S. "I wish I could shake your hand, but it's best we don't make direct       contact yet" Pandemic joke haha but of course, Titan-powered Eldians       making physical contact means ability to share memories so we can't let       known Eren's love for Mikasa and Zeke's masturbation habits lol what<br />      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TakagiSanS304">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span           ><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 3</span>        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "I was making a showdown out of whether we will change uniforms on the           same day" That is not a showdown, Takagi-san. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span>         </div>      </blockquote>      DO YOU THINK, <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Nishikata, that your girl will forget ANYTHING you       two talked about at any point? Like, seriously, asking for a friend.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode where I'm friends with Takagi-san lmao       (#TakagiSanS304), even kids know how to pretend to get sick when new video       games come out and I don't even fully utilize my sick leave. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ah       hey, I'm an honest person, what can I say? <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> So, story. We have a       lot more kick going on with Takagi apparently lol even if the weather got       cold, so let's talk about changing uniforms. As you may have known, the       weather's gotten cold in Japan and if I wasn't wrong I saw reports of       snowing again in recent weeks from our dear voice actresses living there       lol, but yeah, due to shifting season weathers schools are required to       have two uniforms, one for summer which has shorter sleeves and is cooler,       and a winter outfit which has thicker material and is longer sleeved. Oh,       my (technically) middle school outfit is some cyan coloured pyjamas, no       joke. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah, apart from Takagi guessing when she would change       out to the winter uniform along with Nishikata lol she could've just asked       and still win this showdown, but instead she agreed on Nishikata's duel       which is saying the word "cold", in any phrase or form because this is       Hiragana and more flexible than Latin alphabet, we can make those word       puns we all love and hate haha. I can't explain it better what the boy did       to the girl lmao that sounds wrong, but yeah, no pay-outs in betting       Nishikata lost haha, especially when your pay-out is some direct skin to       skin contact with a middle schooler- Let's move on, shall we? This Anime       is making me noticeable by the police. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And don't ask why Sanae       should mind Mina-chan's message not going through telling her to change       out to winter uniform when they themselves didn't do it too lol I'm       getting this right, yes? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Next up, lunch time. I mean, there's the       canteen which is normally where we go we aren't allowed to hang out in our       classrooms during lunch break, so yeah, it's waaaay harder to find a seat       alone considering I can't hide myself from the crowd eating at the       rooftops. *sigh* Anyways haha, Takagi probably noticed Nishikata and his       buddies are all MIA just because (lmao I like how Takao is just pretending       to be sick btw) (and isn't Sakurai eating with his girl why would he eat       with you losers-), and surprise surprise, she found him eating alone. They       had a showdown Nishikata could easily lose to only when he noticed he lost       lol that impulse meta needs to stop bro, but best thing is he thought he's       going to get an even bigger penalty... somewhere along the lines of       getting fed by a female classmate. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> You see, when it's just the       two of them eating lunch alone like this, the problem is... there's no       competition. No rivalry. No one stopping them. No one snooping by at the       bottom of the stairs. Yeah. It sucks. Just wholesome teasing from Takagi.       It's almost too unfair. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Then, we have a UFO sighting. From Takao,       of all people. It's fake, of all truths. Hey, when we have paranormal       expert Sanae on the task, it's easy to just remember such things than to       approach those guys who just like to do stupid things without being       noticed lol I feel you on a very personal level Takao. <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span> Nishikata       thought it'll be cool to also replicate the image taken but he should've       learnt how to use an expert camera app to take shots with a lower frame       rate haha, but yeah, Takagi sure saw something that changed her mind, even       the guy thought she was joking. No, like, bruh. You said she won't lie.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (It's probably like, a remote controlled thing, but who knows       man, it's Anime lmao) Last but not least, we go to the bath. With Takagi       asking when Nishikata is going to the bath because the one at his place       broke and why don't just ask when can he go to her place to use their bath       lmao, the guy was of course expecting her to appear somewhere sometime...       but not like it's that important anyways no one made a promise at the       entrance she might just be stalking inside the mens' bath all this time       haha ah hey. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> They had the after bath drinks together as Takagi       calculated lol this girl's a genius by backtracking, and Nishikata took       his revenge thinking playing an embarrassment match would work in the dark       without seeing each other's red af faces until you stand really close to       each other- Takagi-san I feel like we have been teased all along, you ever       thought about that? What's more than that is Nishikata even brought in the       offer of sending her home and I don't know why you don't just do it and       let her run away anyways, 'cos this showdown would've been concluded so       nicely, I'll just die of embarrassment myself. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> All in all, great       episode as usual and I love how they can continue to deliver such       consistent wholesomeness without even telling us anything about it, I can       never thank them enough. And by the way, we are going to get 8 more       episodes of these, so I really hope you are ready.

I really thought       that'll be the signal, like, the gramps hurting his back, that Gojou       should do something about fulfilling the promise to Kitagawa about making       the outfit but, uh, let's see how it panned out. Let's first talk about       the events that happened and are happening along the two weeks Gojou       thought he needed to finish the cosplay outfit in. Yes, Kitagawa did not       even bother to stop him I don't know why. *sigh* Anyways, we have the       gramps. I mean, letting your gramps literally trip on what was in your       shopping bag is quite a stretch (get it, because stockings?), but I would       say it's rather important in giving Gojou a hint that he would be spending       days walking in and out and even managing the hina doll house at his own       at this time with ad hoc appointments happening here and there and his       tendency to help out the shop... bro THIS is obligation, maintaining that       shop. Also, exams. Midterms are coming in soon it looks like, and as much       as Kitagawa hated to study because she's a       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a> what a       surprise, but as a person I would be worried about how Gojou will be       juggling between the exams itself AND making that outfit. Ah hey, they       exchanged contact information, I don't see why any one wouldn't have       contacted the other for any sort of advice. Like really, I mean, what       should you do, bro? Why not consult Kitagawa, eh? <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> I know right,       ironically Kitagawa herself also didn't manage to catch a hint on what has       been happening to this poor dude. Ironically though, it made him stronger.       Because despite being under stress with exams and making this outfit and       some dude who wants to see hina dolls and flying back to France in a       couple of days lol shoutout to that foreigner, Gojou still managed to       bring himself together and do it in time. And I quote things every episode       in this series because it's that real, the gramps believed in pushing       oneself further just because one likes doing what he or she does.       That's... probably how we can live with work every day haha if that is not       you quit your job right now. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So yeah misunderstandings galore       when Gojou really found out that Kitagawa was NOT expecting him to finish       the outfit as soon as possible, since literally she has no idea (about       everything honestly but specifically) how long it'll take to finish such       an outfit, is now feeling bad because you know, someone who she met at       school did everything just for her. I wouldn't say this is powered by love       but you gotta wonder what has made Gojou going all this while. Haha the       desire to see Shizuku-tan in person? Maybe but I think it was the boobs.       <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But also, Kitagawa crying. Because as much as I liked to see it       in this episode lol, all Gojou wanted is to fulfil her dream to cosplaying       as that slut. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> No really, have you played the "Slippery Girls"       series yet? I bet you haven't. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> She tried the outfit on, we forced       a gal to cut off her eyebrows lol, and we got our first undressing scene       in this series lmao okay the last one is just for me. All in all, this       series continue to deliver not       <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> stuff       which is great tbh haha, and I wished these two would communicate more       considering your grandfather broke his back because of it. <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span> Next       episode looks great, because really what are boob bags when she already       has two? <span title="*dabs*">üòé</span> Haha someone please make this joke next week I beg you lol     </div>    <div>      [TL:DR; Best parts of this episode are (1)       <strike>Suguta Hina</strike> Kitagawa taking off her shirt haha and (2)       how there's a sound effect of her blowing off her sneeze lmao ah hey this       is a show airing on national TV we show boobs and censor sneezes lol]     </div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     height="180"                     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkhn2wR5yDPnZEKrEGY3A-b2GUNX-Ge2u6W_5SpfTJKWOkne80b_0_NDZQK5VmM8SvPMNjJfq9FVtsAVgDjQrn2zT0toP1oLr4QqANx-BNK2GKsqDdjEpupLSEzTj58VfxHS0_CczWOsyFNGeexEfFqYCV7xxqr2TGABO4z84yIHAqYdqmtHsmiYA5=s320"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Me before exams<br />(Okay I don't really cry I just live with                   the pain of not studying lol)                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     height="180"                     src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjaXWTO1dP4wujpngw5ycOu3WtYLsSPkky0u5xP01J0vURvEEt6YkyoAmUXz17KWIgO7v6ETET8lA4DDk2Jz6R1YVUoOab59uCo-kj50bT23wAnGAeTzJgK7BdTKbYCTBccRVQ3mgFNE_TLFd6jPtVIkxxZ1I9etd2r6KmxhjSidYfrDXoi7DZIQS9P=s320"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Me after exams<br />(Yay!

Overall they are good too, a great end to January and a great start to       this year of Klassic Note, I might add.       <b         ><a           href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/ajuju-and-the-night-and-the-music/1605736457?l=en"           target="_blank"           >Waki Azumi's concept album</a         ></b       >      is branded to be a release which features songs you listen to at night,       but I would argue that check out my special compilation from last year in       Klassic Note "At Ease" where I promise you all of them are better to       listen to at night than any of the songs in that album lol. Anyways, I       picked up the first song in the list which isn't the topic song mainly       because the melody and cabaret type of mood got me, and the rest really       didn't have melodies I liked.       <b         ><a           href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/actor/1600658811?l=en"           target="_blank"           >Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new album</a         ></b       >      preceded in full album reviews this week mainly because I knew I can give       the latter more anyways, so yeah, I did give more attention to the songs       in here, mainly giving the topic song which was just a meh, one new song       and the last was basically from their single last year which will complete       that release so we'll review that release real soon.       <b         ><a           href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/mirror/1602183366?l=en"           target="_blank"           >SCANDAL's new album</a         ></b       >      is no surprise considering they started their 15th anniversary last year       with three singles, and their style is safely good Rock music, so not       giving those is just the new stuff I can find in this Collection Artist,       so three new songs including the topic song.     </div>    <div>      <br />      On news concerning music and I know from Twitter, I missed out       <b         ><a           href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1485598356508667910?s=20&amp;t=XTfWd1AsW1x_L564dHXtww"           target="_blank"           >Ryokuoushoku Shakai's album release livestream</a         ></b       >      on Monday don't worry so did I lol,       <b         ><a           href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1485991311291596802?s=20&amp;t=XTfWd1AsW1x_L564dHXtww"           target="_blank"           >SCANDAL's new music video</a         ></b       >      is... uh...
