<h2>The Pandemic Upturn Shopping Spree 2020 Edition: The Roundup</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hsiltRGdL.jpg" /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Come on, I gotta use the PUSS abbreviation to end the year just because haha   did I even bother to do Christmas special posts anyways lol this might be a   first </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Hey, everyone. 'Tis be the season of giving, but throughout this year, I've   been buying a lot of stuff from Japan through the power of the Internet and   further powered by the situation around the world right now, so though this be   the season of giving, we shall talk about giving... myself. ON THE TWELVE DAYS   OF 2020 MY WALLET GAVE TO ME!!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (Wait, is it really twelve days   worth...? *looks at list * Okay I don't think so haha) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>  Talking about PUSS!!!</b> Haha okay me. This has been quite a year, isn't it?   Cooped at home, too much money to spend on the Internet, and after a year of   photobook reviews... I thought I should give back my support to those... idols   I like, and so I did. From pamphlets which for price cost more than photobooks   for a quarter of content worth, to bromide photos bought legally or otherwise,   to stuff I should have never clicked on.... They be all in my room now so I   guess I should round them up after writing so many blog posts about them   already. Yes, it's not as crazy or long as the ones from last year, but I   probably spent way more this year in Japan than I have ever, so I should talk   about my crazy budget, I guess. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">[Yes, the thumbnail was not another review you missed, will explain below]</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br />WHAT THEY ARE</div><div style="text-align: left;">  This post shall only consider those packages that are from my birthday after   those legendary 10 photobooks I did full reviews on (because they will NEVER   be another of these reviews of purchases... haha), and sadly they will not   include the next package I'm expecting to at least appear by the end of this   year, so I'll exclude that for... well we'll probably be doing this again for   next year anyways so <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So, from February to November 2020 and   summarised, they are: </div><div style="text-align: left;">  <ul style="text-align: left;">    <li>      <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-birthday-present-2020.html">The Birthday Present 2020</a>    </li>    <ul>      <li>Uesaka Sumire bromide sets (2 sets of 3 from 2018, 1 set of 5 from 2016)</li>    </ul>    <li>      <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-eleventh-book-worth-of-photos-not.html">The Eleventh Book Worth of Photos: Not Photobook Edition Plus!

I got the same damn   things in 2x gacha rolls (compared to Asakura Momo's), this was an order to   ship differently from the usual line of forwarding because I can't use my card   on the Japanese store, and... to be honest the book is mostly just interviews   which I rather have more photos of, but hey, it is Naobou's rare chance of   doing this considering she doesn't release a photobook every other year or   something, so I'm not complaining. But based on value, I spend waaay too much   on this alone, that may not justify on the actual PUSS itself. Talking about   that... </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">LEAST WORTH ITEM BASED ON SHIPPING</div><div style="text-align: left;">  Yes, it's <b>PUSS 2020</b>. The first time we ever spent that much money (ugh I hate   to admit) on just the same amount of bromides I could have gotten, by the way,   through the TWO OTHER TIMES I bought it directly from the store itself. <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span>   It's a shame to admit, and hopefully I never have to do that again.   Specifically, shipping for every single item is so expensive, I'm just paying   left and right for shipping fees, we have already determined we spent as much   money on all the items as on the amount of money required to ship them. It's   such a waste of money I can't even </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  (Time to flip this around and talk about what are the BEST to buy on this   list) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">MOST WORTH ITEM BASED ON ITEM VALUE</div><div style="text-align: left;">  This one, I really took some time to think. It wasn't something that hit me   immediately, because it's literally asking me to do accounting (which I won't)   and determine which was worth buying... Well, it's already kind of cheap to   consolidate them before bringing them from Japan to me, but still. Let's   see... if it's purely based on item price and not just the contents inside,   and for value of money? It has to be <b>Kitou Akari's live tour goods</b>, because I   paid the same amount pretty much, compared to Toyota Moe on the same package,   and you can tell from my review which one was better in my opinion at least   haha. But hey, I could be wrong. (I'm not) (haha) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  A close second might actually be that <b>Seiyuu Grand Prix magazine</b> I bought in   physical (which I promise you I will never anymore) and then also actually,   bought the next issue in digital via Amazon Kindle because the cover girl was Nan-chan!!! And   I also had spared Amazon credits but yeah, that was the thumbnail btw haha. In this specific one in physical I bought it because of the FOUR bromides that came with it, a very record-breaking amount even   for the serialisation itself, and featured all voices from Anime "KanoKari",   which probably took over the voice actor magazine industry by storm because   every other magazine was covering them to some extent to be honest. This   100-odd pages book had so much content for the price, I'll sign up for a   subscription for the magazine if I don't have to pay for the international   shipping lol </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">MOST WORTH ITEM BASED ON SHIPPING</div><div style="text-align: left;">  Since it has a base flat rate of 1050yen which I can totally swallow, and it   only takes a fifth of the total package in total, obviously this has to go to   <b>the two direct Suruga-ya bromide runs</b> (it's so good I have to do it twice   haha) (ugh) which in shipping probably combined together is still cheaper   than... other than the actual PUSS, probably most of the other packages to be   honest. That's how cheap it was. Kudos to Suruga-ya to be able to keep prices   this low at this time of year, because man, if you haven't seen how much I'm   paying for international shipping at one point, I just want to cry and that's   not even talking about actual PUSS haha <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span> </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">BOLDEST ATTEMPT</div><div style="text-align: left;">  Yes, it's that calendar. Really, not even that collaboration catalog book from   Futon-chan can comapre to <b>Itou Mayuki 2021 Calendar</b>, because besides her being   an adult video actress (don't look her up) (please), I also cannot hang it up   on my wall because GODDAMN IT HAS NUDES!! Come on, it's totally just nudes   though!!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, Minase Inori became my fallback, but even that   might be a regret as I realised how much of a price I have to pay to get it   and also, from recent weeks, what alternatives I might have gotten. (We'll   talk about those next year) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">WORTHY MENTIONS</div><div style="text-align: left;">  They are not in this list because I didn't write about them, and I'm sorry for   VELTPUNCH because after I learnt to not donate to these guys instead I exercised my   support to more... independent artists so <b>donations to&nbsp;Scenarioart and   UNLIMITS lives</b>&nbsp;with the latter hardly coming up with new songs for 4 years already,   and I hope I will see them again with new songs soon, Scenarioart too because   they be having a tour for each season next year, so we will have some new   songs right? I hope so. Both were 1000yen donations, because their lives were   on YouTube for the public, and I don't want to donate in my native currency   here because exchange rates of banks be bad and I have a better alternative   haha you're welcome guys </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">BEST ITEMS BY TYPE</div><div style="text-align: left;">  Last, but not least, let's talk about what is best around here! Not much to   differentiate between them, and I hoped calendars can be a discussion topic   here but... yeah haha so not them: </div><div style="text-align: left;">  <ul style="text-align: left;">    <li>Bromides (not including sets of used bought in bulk)</li>    <ul>      <li>Uesaka Sumire (2018, 2016)</li>      <li>Columbia Fes</li>      <li><b>Minase Inori</b></li>      <li>Taketatsu Ayana (2019)</li>      <li><b>Kitou Akari</b></li>      <li>Toyota Moe (Postcard sized, can't fit on my photo frame)</li>      <li>Tachibana Haru (Postcard sized, signed)</li>    </ul>    <li>Clear Folders</li><ul><li><b>Minase Inori</b></li>      <li>TrySail (Bought just to pad package)</li>      <li>Douki-chan</li>    </ul>    <li>Pamphlets</li>    <ul>      <li>Asakura Momo</li>      <li><b>Kitou Akari</b></li>      <li>Toyota Moe</li>      <li>Touyama Nao (Lack of gravure content)</li>    </ul>    <li>Books</li>    <ul>      <li><b>Seiyuu Grand Prix</b></li>      <li>Douki-chan Vol.1</li>      <li>Douki-chan Vol.2</li>      <li>Tachibana Haru (Has an age gate lol)</li>    </ul>    <li>Gacha (2 attempts each)</li>    <ul>      <li><b>Asakura Momo</b></li>      <li>TrySail (has keychain which isn't bad but)</li>      <li>Touyama Nao (same item x2)</li>    </ul>  </ul>  <div><br /></div>  <div><br /></div>  <div><br /></div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    And there you go, just a short write-up to what a year I had with Japan     considering we didn't even touch each other and I still had so much fun     working from home (for a while) and in the office, and still trying to make this     year better. Hey, gotta go forward every little bit, right? Yeah,     it sounds like real fake considering it's just using nothing but money (I     mean, I could exercise more haha), but hey, at least I was happy throughout the year lol stop consoling yourself me. But hey, happy holidays people, because what better way to give gifts than to... give them to yourself if no one is giving them to you haha I feel sad now lol. Cya guys next time or probably for next year then since you know the next package is up soon maybe next month, and until next time:</div><div><blockquote style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Merry Christmas 2020!!</span></b></blockquote>The world is on fire now so we can at least celebrate its end and hope for a better year ahead. I know I will I have a subscription to Minase Inori fanclub haha bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Buying the latest bromides feels better than buying used ones haha but you know, I can't buy everything since some are from specific events so</div></div><hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
