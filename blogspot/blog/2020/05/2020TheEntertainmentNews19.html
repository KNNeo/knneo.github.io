<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #19</h2>
<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kBRdiyVXjC8/XrewFwfpg5I/AAAAAAAA65w/LIuPk8thOm0WVZq3SxWpn4JSmuYSwdh1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday06_chika1.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Haha guess what my passion project is this weekend? It's about Anime! Yay FINALLY lol<br /><br />Anyways, will update on how I will present my Anime List in a more informative manner (hopefully not with more opinions because I don't want to assert my bias to you all), but hey, this season's Anime will be included as well. And I can tell you, after looking back the many years of Anime I have given? These three below are WAY better than most of the shows I have given over the past decade GOD Glasslip was such trash I can't even<br /><br />Okay, sh*t Anime aside, let's settle for some good laughs! Okay maybe not Yesterday wo Utatte I can't laugh at anyone else other than myself BOOM GOT ME haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kakushigoto</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I felt bad, so I put them (school bags) both on" Haha Hime-chan please grow up to be a nice girl don't get corrupted by anyone or anything else please</div></blockquote>Welcome to the world of kindness, everyone. Where I'm also given the privilege to talk about how awesome this Anime is every week haha okay it's pretty good in their defence. In this lovely new episode (#Kakushigoto06) where we try not to lie to ourselves of harsh reality lol #CorporateSlaves, someone sent Hime-chan a schoolbag. So firstly, whoever this person is who has been sending schoolbags to her every year. Of course the one the father gave her is the best, so they just end up keeping them, but it's obviously more than that. So turns out, spoiler alert, a man in a limo pulled up to talk to him about the bags, and also remind him about his secret to his daughter, and left. So, if you need any guesses, we might see a lot more about the family of Gotoh in future episodes maybe that Hime-chan may still not know of. Like, for example, her grandparents. Moving on!! Next, is the world of kindness. Well, I'm not going to talk about how nice a world of kindness would be, but kind of like Kakushi I'm glad to be able to get a job that I would prefer that is NOT my university major which is still willing to hire me all these couple of years without trying to sh*t on me and still gave me a pay raise. Real grateful, to everything. So yeah, it's a lot harder for a manga artist, that's for sure, because once you lose popularity even because of your one famous work, you're done. You'll never come back, unlike some exceptions. Still, as a consequence of this, Kakushi ended up accepting his first signing event. And of course in all coincidences, it's also the day he is bringing out Hime-chan to play in a theme park. Well, it's one of those kid experience theme parks so the parents don't get to join, but hey, this makes this a lot more convenient. But that kind of also means he didn't get to watch Hime do all the job cosplay (lol she be doing it better than the father haha kawaii) which I hope there is recorded footage for him to keep (maybe), but that also means he can deal with the signing in which its location is just within the same mall building. I like how the author then touches on the "I don't believe I'm that famous for anyone to come" type of character but obviously, considering his manga sells like hotcakes, there are of course, <strike>hired</strike> genuine fans who come to get his signed autograph. I guess I'll never get the purpose of fanatics behind all this just because, but suffice it to say he was able to juggle both of them well. Almost got found out, but you know, Hime-chan doesn't recognise the father in his manga author cosplay haha. In the end, Hime-chan liked the bookstore job the most (no seriously Hime, go watch <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san" target="_blank">Denki-gai</a> or <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/36317/Gaikotsu_Shotenin_Honda-san" target="_blank">Honda-san</a> and tell me again) (although I would argue a "Maru Maru no Hime-chan" would be way awesome of a sequel lol), and the father got away with it once again. Hey, for someone whose objective is to totally not allow the daughter to know his job isn't... a stable job, for starters, this is as much as he can avoid it being a total disaster haha. And... reverse flashback!! I swear if you didn't even weep at that last part you are not human. *laughs* Today Hime-chan found the new boxes dated her current age probably. Not like we know of what her world is now (for example, does she even know of manga, and is she a fan?), but I guess considering she can understand the manga itself makes you wonder at what point they will reveal the father's job thing, or if the father is even around anymore. Hey, in case you were wondering, now is a good time to think about it. Cya guys next week.<br />[Hime-chan galore because why not!!! Hehe]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HlUZ888XZfk/Xrekbz0XUfI/AAAAAAAA65Y/Dl1YFIvi3P8a9di0R2lepWXhf1i6QYpKwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto06_hime3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so cute I can't even<br />(Shoutout to all the deliverymen and front line workers out there now)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ot1kn2JyGhY/Xrekb23IPmI/AAAAAAAA65c/wvb6QvOqgQgW1C8D0QUXSw-MR-Jm5plaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kakushigoto06_hime7.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This genuinely makes me sad, really.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "Vendor specific illustration cards" I feel bad for the authors already and that's why you don't see them drawing shop bonuses for like, 20 stores unless you're as popular as Kakushi here haha<br />P.P.S. "Watching one of the little girls! She's going to think I'm some creep!" Haha I mean, for the place where parents get to watch kids, she can only suspect you are watching other people's kids and thinking they are cuter than your own lol<br />[I FREAKING SWEAR they cast Sakura Ayane for this Anime because she can do the man voice on all the tsukkomi haha like really go watch every other Anime with her as a boyish character]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Yesterday wo Utatte</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It's something I don't want to remember" YES new character haha I know Rikuo was in a harem all along lol</div></blockquote>CRT TELEVISION??!! WHAT YEAR IS THIS?? *laughs* (Hint: It's around the 90s) Okay, jokes aside which will end up revealing my age lmao (Go to the "Wanted List" page if you want to know), in this new episode of I didn't realise this was actually a harem (#YesterdayWoUtatte06) it's... basically a homeless girl who comes back to find her ex. *laughs* But like seriously, you can stay if you dye your hair black; that's my only condition haha. So, cue new character which also Rikuo dated for four months, Chika-chan. (Edit: Ah, voiced by&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/125916/Chika_Yuzuhara" target="_blank">KitaEri</a>. No wonder I didn't recognise this super familiar voice since I watched "WORKING!!") (To know if it's her notice her distinguishable nasal tone in her natural speech) She's... just as passer-by for this series, I suppose, like the one last week. Everything ended in this episode of her, I mean. So, how <strike>another woman appeared in Rikuo's life</strike> a woman ended up in Rikuo's place. *laughs* Cue Chika-chan; a freaking genius at high school, someone who just lost her way in life and begged nice guy Rikuo to take her in until she gets paid and can pay off her rent, and... it's his ex. Yeah, shit's gotten real now, yes? Within this love rectangle which is of course temporary, orange-haired girl takes herself real comfortably in his care (just the shelter) while literally giving misunderstandings to the other two main girls in the series just by being at his place haha. Aw man, isn't this the best of such romance drama haha the author knows. So, how they found out. Rikuo was down with a fever again (Chika-chan getting laid again GIF coming right up!! Haha) and... you know, kind woman Shinako and <strike>current gf</strike> Haru-chan (lol) of course, went to visit him once they hear he wasn't working at the convenience store but of course, is surprised at seeing another woman at his place. I mean, for anything, this is only going to spawn misunderstandings, so here we go, I guess. *laughs* Haru-chan is obviously mad at someone that is not her at his place, and Shinako... she is taking it real well haha. (I swear that nomikai is literally the production sh*tting on Kana-chan right now lol) (I wonder though, if she ever) (haha) Anyways, Focus here, surprisingly, is on Shinako because what can Haru-chan do anything about this lmao. So, as you can see, Shinako is clearly somewhat jealous or pissed that someone is living with Rikuo somehow. Don't ask me why, he got rejected already anyways, so what's with the leftover feelings I don't know, but we now do know that... you know, she hasn't gotten over him yet. Maybe. *laughs* Thanks to Chika-chan knowing people well, she takes her next available opportunity to (1) explain to Shinako that she's just a freeloader who is taking advantage of Rikuo (not in a sexual way lol) and his kindness to tide things over, and (2) leaves as soon as she gets paid so to avoid more misunderstanding in what is a love triangle in Rikuo's love life right now haha. Hey, if I'm Chika-chan I'll also take a smoke and make a run for it lmao. Anyways, wonderful episode which probably doesn't matter, though I would say that it has some effect on Shinako, no joke. What will it make of Rikuo's already sophisticated love life? We shall see for it ourselves soon. Haha really, didn't expect his love life to be this exciting tbh didn't regret watching this show<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kBRdiyVXjC8/XrewFwfpg5I/AAAAAAAA65w/LIuPk8thOm0WVZq3SxWpn4JSmuYSwdh1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday06_chika1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sadly not a fan of orange hair so sorry Chika-chan haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gHY8uPJmfzU/XrewFwSf6UI/AAAAAAAA650/4WnlxlYaGHsmQTEjtG3AmbBEwmE13uezgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/singyesterday06_friends.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">TFW they realise you're still <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/185/Kana_Hanazawa" target="_blank">a virgin at 30</a> lmao BOOM<br />(That abbreviation is called "those faces when" instead haha)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "There's the girl who you have a crush on, there's Haru-chan, and now you have your ex" This show in a nutshell haha Rikuo is getting ALL the pussy- "Why are you enjoying this so much?"

Okay, they are really cramming a lot of plot in every episode, so let's talk about all of them, shall we? In this new episode (#KaguyaSamaS205), we talk about the days leading up to the Student Council election because Kaguya wanted Shirogane in for some reason hehe. Firstly, Shirogane without the President role. He looks dapper, somehow haha, but also, it just became a real turn-off to Kaguya, in a nutshell. *laughs* I mean, it's totally going to be real different if Shirogane turns normal and never has to deal with Student Council stuff anymore (almost like a boys love Anime lmao) but we're not here for that, and also Kaguya is getting worried, so she asks someone for advice. Nope, not Hayasaka because that's her love rival lol, but Kashiwagi. Hey, the advice thing gotta turn around somehow, and here we are. This is probably the most screen time we will have of that cute girl, so I hope you've enjoyed it to the most like I did haha Mocho~!! *laughs* Ahem, coming back, surprisingly Kashiwagi is a lot more smarter in EQ than this rich kids' nerd (lol), so she offers the best advice possible even though she knew that <strike>Kaguya still likes Shirogane</strike> Kaguya's friend's affection towards that other guy is true love lol even with the image change. And add in the reality checks of Chika-chan and Ishigami (man bro what do you know you virgin haha) and things got real complicated as Kashiwagi tries not to let others take a dump on that main girl's feelings and ruin this series lol, and in the end we realised that Kaguya might really like Shirogane when he's overpowered and serious instead of his relaxed self now haha. I don't know man, but seriously, Shirogane not being President of the Student Council feels weird to some extent, I would argue. Next up, this is not a "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/13333/Tari_Tari" target="_blank">TARI TARI</a>" series by the way, but "Shirogane wants to sing" is on the title it seems. And just like volleyball... he sucks at it. I mean Chika-chan, you could've just tested him before agreeing to ruin your reputation as a musical genius in front of him at least? *laughs* But seriously though, Chika-chan training part deux!! *laughs* She did it though, probably, to a lesser extent in effort compared to the previous time I hope, but man do the lyrics of the school anthem hit her so hard she burst into tears whilst conducting the school cohort to the song. I can feel you, Chika-chan, I really do. Throwback to the past where I also didn't realise I was singing badly but thank goodness I realised it myself before like, 11 or 12? Yeah, and also around the time I started realising the music around me was trash (suck on this, C-Pop) (haha) so maybe yeah, people do change. For the gorilla voice that is Shirogane... boy am I glad if this is going to make it into the soundtrack. The properly sung version, that is. *laughs* But man, must every other Anime base their school anthem on a success story? I know <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/20847/Seitokai_Yakuindomo" target="_blank">way</a> too <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38619/Joshikousei_no_Mudazukai" target="_blank">many</a> of such <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/10165/Nichijou" target="_blank">examples</a> to talk about already so I'm not going into that haha. Lastly, tackling the candidates for the upcoming Student Council elections. Wow, this one. We know Kaguya is real good at manipulating people as with the third guy trying to run for elections, but man, did she have a hard time dealing with Iino Miko, who has practically no way to attack her due to her pureness, but also, practically no chance of winning because you know, we got the perfect couple to win the elections. *sees Kaguya embarrassed* Anyways (haha), we see an intense battle of wits here since the first episode of the series tbh (I mean, after that it's mostly indirect flirting lol), but once Kaguya realised what she's up to, she... she got scared of her haha Miko-chan might have gotten Kaguya with the "you two should get together" shtick and I SERIOUSLY don't want to see the former become the Student Council honestly it would suck lol no <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">ichaicha</a>?? I'm not watching then this show sucks haha let's see if it is or not next week because it's ELECTION DAY BOYS guess who will win wrong answers only I say Trump lmao bye<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pCDNdZ0_Lgo/Xre-0R6ZRMI/AAAAAAAA66Q/3AzXQj_szyYkoCV2aH7-w1ieeONZzhP3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kaguyasamaS205_ishigami.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">WTF is this, a boys love Anime??

We're close to giving some <b>SHISHAMO</b> though I would argue, but I'm not in the mood for them because... SPECIAL OTHERS haha that's for next week btw<br /><br />On news on Twitter and Instagram because where else can you promote your artists and/or works now, <b>nano.RIPE is playing Animal Crossing</b> on their YouTube channel (ugh) (wrong audience, people), uh... I guess there's more of <b>Scenarioart's live performances on YouTube</b> if you missed that, many more have appeared on Instagram just to regain attention at these rough times, and <b>tacica's new single</b> will be reviewed next month because thanks to YouTube I gave them another chance. So yeah, "tashika" as it should be pronounced... count yourself lucky haha<br /><br />So for next week, we're going on a journey yet again, on <b>SPECIAL OTHERS' new album</b> and man, have I prepared for it by listening to the previews for the album on YouTube and... I see some prospective good ones hehe. Don't worry, I'll end up giving half the album anyways like I always do haha. And anything else if I can find more considering many are postponing even their digital releases to the next two months. Well, at least June and July will be packed with new songs haha yay me. Oh also, probably will try to give <b>LuckLife's new single</b> a chance too, seeing it came out this week and I totally forgot about them especially when they keep asking on Twitter via polls when it's coming out I don't know man just tell me lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Well, I guess that's it then. I know it's not much on the Klassic Note portion but hey, I'm lazy to go find new songs anyway so I just do the occasional YouTube recommendations view like everyone else does now which I must say, is not what Klassic Note is about. I actively find songs to listen to tbh, but just that now... you know, I listen to myself work more than listen to music with all these stay at home stuff going on so... it's not that easy haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I'm using my brain to do that many other third-party developers have come up with for like, Javascript libraries so I have a feeling I'm exercising my brain too hard haha but I can argue that I'm doing custom stuff but then again if I want it to be re-usable... haha bye<br /><div id="hiddenTags" style="font-size: 0em;">Kakushigoto,YesterdayWoUtatte,KaguyaSama</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
