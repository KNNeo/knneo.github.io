<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #8</h2>
<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-27Z2st6AeVw/XlIs3FzolHI/AAAAAAAA5W8/OdrOx4xPqcIfaVQtT-L2QaQ69c8MOpNXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri07_ayakashi.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Wait, did I not do Klassic Note Artist Evaluation this year? Dammit haha that's what happens when you have a working life now. (Audience: But you took work leave over the new year.) *silence* MOVING ON!!<br /><br />On other news that is Klassic Note, I'm testing other ways of presenting Hall of Fame and statistics about the song awards, mainly hosting it instead of through a PDF document and including new categories but I'll need to finish that database integration soon to get more accurate data. Funny thing is, the new version of Office didn't make this any easier haha I still have to redo the charts to make it work my way *sigh*<br /><br />Okay, let's talk about entertainment, I guess. My mind is just filled with Animal Crossing and that Nintendo Direct now I feel the urge to take work leave or off just to play this on a Friday haha I'll think about it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">We're skipping <strike>Yumemi-chan</strike> Hatena this week (lol) because it's your half-season recap episode. We'll come back to it next week.</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I spend every day cleaning (your) bathroom, a Cinderella whose prince never comes" Man, why is Yashiro describing her reality more accurately with every episode? lol</div></blockquote>"I shouldn't be friends with Hanako-kun... because, he is already dead!" Man Yashiro, you can't be friends with a dead person? Won't say too much of my friendship with my grandmother but. *laughs* In this new episode (#HanakoKun07), we, uh, stumbled upon a confession, I suppose. Didn't expect this, but you know, Yashiro be a hopeless romantic she will take a ghost for a boyfriend lol. Okay, that might just be part of the episode, but probably still the best. The rest might be too deep in lore I don't even want to pick on it but we have to, so let's talk about it. But firstly, about Yashiro. Last week we got a good amount of flashback as to Hanako's past ie. him as a student named Amane, and he probably died at some point. While killing someone though? That we might not know, but Yashiro wants to know him more so that you know... actually, I don't know. I guess Yashiro is in it now, so she deserves to know. Problem is, to how to ask him for the truth. I guess that's hard in itself, so Minamoto (Kou) asked to make donuts with him, so to give that ghost some stuff to eat and make it up again. Obviously, Kou is good at cooking (he told her how to mix using the bowl) and the ingredients were bought by the brother as mentioned by the brother himself who just kept quiet and be stuffed with donuts lol, but suffice it to say Kou might be trying to be nice. Again, if it were the brother Hanako would've eaten one and dropped dead haha didn't happen though. What DID happen was one of the Mokke (those cute things) was... Man, that one Mokke... you traitor!! *laughs* Hey, within a small community inside of a small community we still will have traitors, don't we? So yeah, that one just left without being observed? I mean, the older Minamoto is looking, to say the least. And when things go down he will strike, hopefully. And then, there's the confession. Abrupt, but I guess everyone will feel indifferent even if it is from Hanako-kun. Still, thanks to the donuts, Hanako met his evil self so to speak (I mean, we don't even know anything), mentioned about how he was killed by the other self, and then left. So this gives us a little more insight into the truth behind the murder. Not much, but we can speculate on it now. From what I can think, there can only be two ways, if we assume for now, that Hanako killed someone who looked just like him. Amane, I mean. Since so far we only know that everyone can see the evil one as one who looks exactly like Hanako. So either (1) he killed a twin of himself ie. another person who then with rumours can be revived into its rather weak state as of now (and found a human friend), or (2) he killed his evil self. How he knew of this might be bad but considering he knows of a teacher who can see the future... maybe not impossible after all. Then, we now know about the bad guys in this Anime series. With Sakura the broadcaster and probably servant to evil Hanako (as I would call him from now until we know a name) who has been spreading all the rumours, and Natsuhiko who might actually have powers to protect the girl ie. he's likely a Seven Wonder because any more powerful he would have already be dealt with even by Minamoto (Teru) in this school. The days went as normal as Sakura continues to spread new rumours through the broadcast room (which is the same voice you heard since episode 1), and... something weird might happen if you tie your shoes at the school entrance within the lockers. Minamoto (Kou) caught the suspect, but instead of exorcising it he asked Hanako for advice and... decided to clear the spirit of its sins? I mean, if it's spawned from a rumour likely it doesn't have much to fulfil but man does it sound like a Japanese millennial with the talk about porno lol. (Is this what it's like there? Haha) Oh, so that's what they were talking about on Twitter about "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/erobideo" target="_blank">ero-video</a>" lmao next episode we get hardcore sex scene-!!! Yeah right haha cya for not sex scenes next week that spirit sounds like a gay lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mG2bCbfr4ts/XlHzX-K_R0I/AAAAAAAA5Vk/HM1YQM134XMkM_bcXOn_F6UjtdZgJF9pQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun07_yashiro5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oh so THIS was what they were talking about on Twitter about ero-video lol not true but</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gC3RjKmIg_k/XlHzYxbsQnI/AAAAAAAA5Vo/uf5u_1m6L4knCfDAwR3dfvZZUHjni8g5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun07_couple4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is pretty wholesome, I must admit. Sorry, Hanako. *laughs*</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "There must be another way to settle this!" Oh if you meant a spirit spawned out of rumours and Hanako's look? It looks female so let's- (Let's corrupt her young mind by showing her porn maybe haha) (Again, we think it's a her)<br />P.P.S. "Traffic safety? Was there a crash in your brain??" I wanted to make the joke from the start tbh, but hey the story did it by itself haha good job author<br />[TL:DR; Hanako is GAY!!! Haha okay if you are gay with yourself I doubt that is gay but still]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Are prime numbers really that interesting?" My mind be like YUKIMURA TRIGGERED and this show didn't disappoint haha</div></blockquote>Is that what Kanade-chan's impression of a drinking party is like? You bet I'm on the same side as those nerds on this ie. zero experience lol oh it's just me? *laughs* In this f**ked up episode (#Rikekoi07) where NO ONE gets drunk I promise you (Aw, not even Kanade-chan?? But I wanna f-), only Yukimura is awake haha I wonder why. And that's why like him I don't get myself drunk. Sadly he's going to be the only guy standing on my side on this lol. And yeah, watching everyone else get wasted haha. Anyways, the party. It's not the kind Kanade-chan imagined, and like her, we get to see for the first time what it's like having a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nomikai" target="_blank">nomikai</a> in Ikeda Lab. Well, in summary, everyone got drunk, but hey, they gotta set it up. Yukimura doesn't drink because he doesn't want to act dumber than he has to (lol, can't help but agree), Himuro needs to reach a tipping point before she loses her composure as a woman and turns into a kid whose voice is probably Ten-chan's cutest voice acting yet haha, Torasuke literally goes back to his childhood upon being drunk despite having crazy drink parties in the soccer club, and I guess Ibarada can drink a lot before falling asleep since she probably bought the drinks lol. Man, it's a real relief you can see the sensei drunk and asleep in the background because with Kanade-chan and the sensei left I wouldn't want anyone to imagine what might happen between the remaining couple. *silence* *laughs* *sees drunk Kanade* Oh well haha. Although unlike Yukimura maybe I would be interested in Kanade-chan's past Yukimura DON'T YOU DARE GET INTERESTED IN HER GO HUG YOUR HIMURO haha okay I'm done. (Kanade-chan throw me around as much as you like just don't throw up on me after you drink lmao) Next up... a science-type Cinderella story?? WTF? I mean, I can interject at this as many times as I want since Kanade-chan is not here lol, but man, can we not? *laughs* So the guys thought it would be a great idea to find more references to prove love in science, but you know, asking for surveys might be a little challenging. And thus, Ibarada and Kanade suggested fiction. I mean, we do know some of the many stories out there are based on real life stories, probably written to a happier ending (unless you're Anime "Attack on Titan" or "Babylon" lol FUCK YOU MAGASE haha) to spice things up for a romance story so probably not accurate already, so I SWEAR this is a filler portion of the Anime where the Anime scriptwriters and producers alike start thinking of how to science-type all fiction stories as much as they can lol. It's more than just mildly irritating considering I don't even know the Kaguya-hime story well enough (I should go watch the Studio Ghibli version like I told myself years ago), so I can only relate with the Cinderella one which is nothing. *laughs* I mean, I legit thought "conservation of mass" is that boob joke I heard of before but, uh, nuclear reactions are funnier haha. They even threw in an omake just so they can write another science-type fiction story- They should just try this style on modern stories they can't even use science in whatever century the stories were from lol. I had a great laugh in this episode though, although I would argue even Kanade-chan kind of got tired of doing the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> and this is why I'd rather get drunk with the lot of them in a drinking party haha because I rather not end up talking about the largest prime number with Yukimura lol. (Hey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number" target="_blank">still accurate as of the episode</a>) Next episode... I guess we're right on track to finding proof for love instead of being about (0.2335 +/- 0.001)mm off track since 23.456 days ago rounded up lol I'm done being smart for the week<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6_JKgiS5g-U/XlIfKSvUV3I/AAAAAAAA5WE/99ayM4S178kZO8l6hXzwGpACFRIja_BDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi07_himuro3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Come to me Himuro I'll buy your drinks AND kiss the shit out of you haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oCXPtz7T1ss/XlIfKQfvQsI/AAAAAAAA5WI/q-aQFtnd0Vw5eZCcbPJZBvvwN3w1Q3N7wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi07_kanade2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My opinion of this episode as with every episode lmao</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

"Being dignified and intellectual is the science-type I aim to be" And then Himuro IMMEDIATELY gets drunk lol I wish Ten-chan was like this also this is how I would start drinking alcohol hehe<br />[Okay since there are so many fiction stories they made let's do more screens, yes?

Okay Kotoko-chan your boy hardly knew that woman lol maybe he did touch them during the fight haha we don't know</div></blockquote>Oh yeah Terada I almost forgot you sacrificed for the greater good but seriously man, rest in peace. In this probably mellow new episode (#KyokouSuiri07) Saki-san can you not lie to your own police? But then again haha she can't really put the alibi as "I was visiting the scene where Steel Lady Nanase died", huh. *laughs* So, remembering that this is still reality where your can't see any youkai, Saki-san can't really tell the police who are investigating now that Terada was killed... by a ghost. I mean, tell me that and I probably won't even believe it even though I'm watching two youkai shows this season haha. And so, after a day of rumours and speculation, the trio had to sit down and think of a solution as soon as possible. Kotoko might not be wrong in thinking that it'll only get worse since the police will not be able to find evidence of someone getting killed and even if they release such information then it'll only solidify Nanase's position of being culprit within the online community which will infinitely make her stronger, thus going down a route with no return. Eventually, Kuro-san did suggest something that made Kotoko-chan click, so we shall see what happens next episode, I guess. Meanwhile, the guys are preparing for the onset where Nanase might strike at any time, killing more humans in the process and strengthening her existence as a youkai. If you really want to guess what Kuro suggested to Kotoko-chan about having a bunch of people involved in the incidents involving Nanase ie. a group of people behind such stuff, it might take a lot more maintenance to keep this truth alive, and yeah, Kuro-san is probably going to die a lot more times than he may have to to turn the tides around every corner in the future. Or he can just fight Nanase every night and not sleep lol this is his part-time job now. And since it'll take another episode or two before we can conclude this, so next week... I guess we'll be talking about this Rikka whom we have no idea is yet, as far as it's mentioned as Kuro's cousin. I mean, we gotta believe she's also a victim of the future-predicting experiments of the family right? Just like Kotoko mentioned? No one said she was dead even though she was on a hospital bed, yes? We shall see then, I guess. If they have to talk about it like this then it's not just Kuro who can predict the future now, to be honest. I don't really have the mood for mystery-solving but this show got me though. Haha Kotoko-chan too but we only talk about her fantasies off season, yes? *laughs* To end this, I would like to emphasise on what the guys have been predicting even without resorting to any methods, how Nanase's popularity would increase over time. Considering now, and if she continues to kill and people believe it was her doing, then people will be scared of her. However, despite being scared of her it's also believing in her existence (I mean, I have to believe she exists to be scared of it, yes?), so this fever will never subside. However, people will eventually not believe in her existence in resistance to such a reality and also due to fear, which will comparatively make her weaker in power over time. Sadly, this is over a very long time, and many would have to be sacrificed for that eventuality to happen. To be frank I thought Saki-san would be a great scapegoat for all this haha think about it I shall stop here<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-27Z2st6AeVw/XlIs3FzolHI/AAAAAAAA5W8/OdrOx4xPqcIfaVQtT-L2QaQ69c8MOpNXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri07_ayakashi.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Which is cuter?

"Did an immortal just talk to me about health?" Wow lol this is such an inside joke for this Anime I can't even<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #00b8cc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Hey it's birthday week! So let's see what we've got for me. <b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> is... under TOYS FACTORY so we get nothing somehow for an indie band so sadded already, but not like the impression got better with the number of music videos I hear online and... am not impressed with so I guess we'll review this again as and when it appears. <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single</b> is probably the focus of the week and I would argue, THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT here in Klassic Note, as it's great of a song and also a song for me to think about, sort of like a wake up call. Don't ask me if I gave the amazarashi cover B-side because I didn't give it 4 years ago I won't suddenly do this now lol. <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> had a disappointing topic song thanks to one Kitagawa who writes Anime theme songs for he, but the B-side which is written by her is more of my taste. Again, half the reason why she's a Collection Artist today. The other half is her brush in chance of good Anime theme songs haha<br /><br />Next week I might spend more time going through <b>Numakura Manami's best album</b> in which I haven't because I just gave the new and last song from last week, and we're giving Anime "Hanako-kun" theme songs with <b>Jibaku Shounen Band's single</b> which is basically two singers (one of which we know from Anime "Tada-kun" who is basically a composer himself, Oonishi Masayoshi) and a producer behind the scenes of which I would say it isn't great from the music video online now, and <b>Kitou Akari's 2nd single</b> which... man did we not get much out of the topic song and again, placing the Anime theme song on B-side isn't making the ending theme any better in my opinion.We shall see about it then. I'll end up giving Akarin more songs than I want anyways haha<br /><br />On news from the Internet and beyond mainly Twitter, <b>Aimer's new single</b> slated for end March is... probably worse than the ClariS and TrySail theme songs somehow so I might just skip it, <b>SHE'S new music video</b> for their upcoming album ain't bad it is rather mellow in tone but I hope that is not it for their album overall haha it's still good though, and <b>UNLIMITS is releasing a live event single</b> on an upcoming event in March which I'll probably not get to hear, but good to know they might be back for new songs and that'll get me hype for them sooner than later. <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES' new music video</b> for their upcoming album is... okay, but not something I like, <b>SID's new music video</b> for their upcoming single next month is probably indicative of their uprising again despite the likely outdated style so I hope they try to keep up, and <b>sphere's radio livestream</b> just in the evening hours ago announced a documentary Blu-Ray from their 10th year anniversary live event from last week, and yes Kotobuki Minako made it official with her departure for further education as a way to (selfishly, lol) do something for herself. It makes me sad to see you go for a year, Mina-chan, but you can treat yourself. <strike>We got the newbies to cover you anyway</strike>&nbsp;No one can replace you my dear so please come back soon hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm done for the week. Is is just me or can I not see my mouse on the PC with my monitor brightness down? Maybe that's why, but I also don't want to just turn up the brightness and blind my eyes for the long term to be honest, but enlarging the cursor or changing it to one of the other presets in Windows 10 isn't helping much it doesn't work in games. Then again my mouse still has scrolling problems and I can't get used to changing wallpapers in a slideshow because I can't choose a couple and have to choose a folder now... Windows 10 sucks five year into beta haha. Cya guys next time, and until then... I might have decided on whether to pre-load the Animal Crossing game and take time off to play this haha or maybe I should do a photobook omake now that Hanazawa Kana is releasing a new one with her almost half-naked?? Haha swimsuits or it doesn't count Kana-chan lol I probably won't but if my friend wants to gift it who knows? Hehe bye for now<br /><div id="hiddenTags" style="font-size: 0em;">HanakoKun,RikeKoi,KyokouSuiri,Humbreaders,RyokuoushokuShakai,yanaginagi,NumakuraManami,JibakuShounenBand,KitouAkari,Aimer,SHE'S,UNLIMITS,THEORALCIGARETTES,SID,sphere</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
