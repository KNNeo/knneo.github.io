<h2>The Birthday Present 2020</h2>
Well, happy birthday to me, I guess.<br /><br />I'll cover these in more detail in later posts, but suffice it to say my "birthday package" has arrived. I really thought it'll be bad due to the epidemic that is around right now (not delivered from Wuhan btw if en route or not I don't know lol), but then again I did may a lot more for this to even arrive so... I'm glad it even appeared.<br /><br />I bought three main things for this time around, and I thought I'd like to share them. From Kito Akari's 1st photobook to Liyuu's debut single to Uesaka Sumire's photo sets, the latter is what I wanted to share since it'll not have any mention in the following reviews I'll be going through in detail later. So, let's get to it then!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE ORIGIN (OF CONSOLIDATION)<br />The photobook was already planned when it was announced last year but only around the time I wanted to order that single which I decided to pre-order this about a month ago so that I could avoid the special ticket to her signing event (I want to give others who can go a better chance haha), and Sumipe's bromides is just to compliment the package since I've wanted to have more of her images in physical copy (not as in printing her selfies out, mind you), so here we are.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE (IN SUMMARY)<br />I'm not going to show everything in detail, but I will show everything that I can talk about. I just won't talk about all of them here as I will only talk about Sumipe's photos here instead.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cwsVvrH6qak/Xj4zDMUJ4DI/AAAAAAAA4c0/B0LM4YpVvcY11_IuH2g_6QhZ7dGinDM3wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200208_114118.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cwsVvrH6qak/Xj4zDMUJ4DI/AAAAAAAA4c0/B0LM4YpVvcY11_IuH2g_6QhZ7dGinDM3wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200208_114118.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Damn, that is a lot...</td></tr></tbody></table>Specifically, I just chose whatever is left on her official store, two sets of 3 which were from last year, and a set of 5 which were randomly chosen from 15+1 mystery photo. I really wonder who will get the special one, but these are already special to me. Pity about the text in the images though; they should've kept it clean so it'll look good on my picture frame hehe<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5rieS3ScyEg/Xj4zJUz4bRI/AAAAAAAA4c4/gm1FvSc4S9oJ4Pjx3MtSQLFuE7tXqqT_wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200208_113351.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5rieS3ScyEg/Xj4zJUz4bRI/AAAAAAAA4c4/gm1FvSc4S9oJ4Pjx3MtSQLFuE7tXqqT_wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200208_113351.jpg" width="320" /></a></td><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puFsRhaHsSI/Xj4zJXhV-6I/AAAAAAAA4c8/NG5WoT35Oq0Psd_fEzle3eMrEHdUWqgAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200208_113438.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puFsRhaHsSI/Xj4zJXhV-6I/AAAAAAAA4c8/NG5WoT35Oq0Psd_fEzle3eMrEHdUWqgAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200208_113438.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">For once I can ignore her chest and appreciate her beauty haha</td></tr></tbody></table>The set of 5 was specifically from about 3 years ago where I started following her selfies (lol), because I can remember the others that I've seen and I'm glad I got something outside of her selfies so at least there is little overlapping. Again, this is already ten thousand times better than her music releases where they gift a signed bromide... yep, signed. So yeah, the cleaner the images are off text the better, don't you say? And I'll talk about the other two items respectively.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J9jueJXZ-pk/Xj4zMLnvruI/AAAAAAAA4dA/U4Q5B-IzqKESacF8YNgL8dbNSc904NvrACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200208_113116.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J9jueJXZ-pk/Xj4zMLnvruI/AAAAAAAA4dA/U4Q5B-IzqKESacF8YNgL8dbNSc904NvrACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG_20200208_113116.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">If you need a reason to why I started to like her from 2016 just look at these</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br />So there you have it, just a sneak peek of what to expect just in case I can't finish the posts by tonight considering this is s Saturday and I have all day to do this when this package arrived in the morning. I'll see you around then, starting from Liyuu's debut single. I've came full circle to give a Chinese while escaping from Chinese songs lol bye<hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
