<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #29</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5EdKeBxKe8s/XxQME8oOpqI/AAAAAAAA9BU/mPzlHxqZ3sowq4J58z2Swy1G4-_scQhNwCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/greatpretender02_laugh.gif" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Happy birthday to Natsukawa Shiina, my beloved imouto. Well it was yesterday already, so what the heck haha. Also, Naobou was my phone wallpaper that day so what the heck haha *gets punched*<div><br /></div><div>Anyways, welcome back!! The weekend sure is fast, isn't it? You know I had a great weekend when I didn't take naps and I wake up early even on Sunday because there are many things to do OR my mom likes to blast freaking speeches in the morning ugh please stop</div><div><br /></div><div>Note: Blogger you are getting irritating with the new interface icons and now I can't see to know if autosave kicked in because it's behind a dropdown menu and also compose and HTML view because of the same reason. Seriously man, who gave you the feedback? Some intern at Google?? I can take their place tbh haha that guy can only ace the interview I can ace your next big revamp lol let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER02"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"You've finally got a job. Don't just give up just because it's hard" Okay mom you referring to my REAL job or the one I lied to you on? lol Edamura wasn't like this when he was younger</div></blockquote>Wow what is <strike>Edamame</strike> Edamura's father man he sounds like he murdered someone or something haha. In this new episode of (#GREATPRETENDER02) whatever I'm watching here but I promise you even without theme songs (technically, originals) I can give this my first exception. Well, this is not the first actually if I didn't remember wrongly but this is still worth a watch so far. Let's talk about why. Firstly, plot twists. It still works. Continuing from the formulae devised last week in the first episode, Edamura had his predicament explained from Laurent, and... most of my deductions were correct, but I guess I missed the part that the old woman he fixed the pipes on is also part of Laurent's contacts, and of course his buddy who turns out, thanks to the flashback, to be his boss in the past until you realise this motherf**ker deals with illegal goods lol. Rough on luck is Edamura too, considering he's lived a life (probably) without a father because his dad probably is bad, the mother who is in hospital till death (goddamn that white towel on the hospital bed), and with nothing left Edamura can't find a job, so he decided to live through life without one. Interestingly, finding the guy back who ruined his life. As things go now though, that he's in "the US of A", Laurent explained his position and rather scheming plan to take the drug lord or movie producer down if possible, and Edamura just became an easy pawn to disguise as the mysterious drug inventor under Laurent's plan. The boy though, as dumb as he may be, really thought he was tricked into this all the way since we know pretty much everything is planned in the first episode (even the bodyguards who chased him down as he ran), so yeah, he decides to not live such a life, I guess. Problem is, Laurent (technically) won the bet, so this boy has to stay as his henchman, I think. Well, Abbie is here to make sure he doesn't leave... and here's where things get interesting. So yeah, plot twists. If you haven't seen the episode please skip this because I'm ending with these anyways, but yeah, Abbie decides to let him go. Not because he's not important or if she thinks Laurent thinks he's a good keep since he probably isn't lol, but yeah, as she said, all of them are lone wolves. Gotta cover yourself at a moment's notice, since you can only rely on yourself in the end anyways, whatever happens. So yeah, she let Edamura leave in hopes that he won't get them into trouble at least haha. Interesting part is down the line, as Laurent visits the Capone's mansion again, knowing that the price of his fake drug just increased, and he gets twice the amount now because "the doctor said so" lmao yes it's Edamura btw. Yeah, playing around with real girls in the pool too so FUCK YOU ABBIE haha. (I feel that I should limit release on the vulgarities here since they are all Westerner characters and they can't stop these words without placing the f-word in between like I do lol) So yeah, Edamura wins? I mean, the series hasn't ended so I assume the battle isn't over, but you know, we know who has the upper hand every time. Edamura is unfamiliar with the place here, and Laurent is just trying not to get him killed while he gets another assistant, excuse me, lone wolf in his team. Great episode though, and hearing Freddie Mercury in the ending just make this so much better haha. I... might end up giving this series if all goes well I mean next case after this mini arc is in Singapore I couldn't miss that even at the sake of pride for my country just joking I'm not that far up their a-</div><div>[Oh, just as a side note? Remember Laurent said "it's a different story" when Edamame mentioned about the taxi driver? Yeah, just a note.]</div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OxHo8Up7vnI/XxQL2IkMPuI/AAAAAAAA9BI/o-TU6styQG4v6YLDW_P_LejqFkwORRImwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender02_kudo.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How you know this is a scam lol<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_QvlpBGj49M/XxQL2HeMW9I/AAAAAAAA9BM/ClugesTqTIs7UxmywkD3FVO8EIGICrX3wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender02_makoto1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How you know this is a scam lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Okay old man you don't have to rub it in NO GO AWAY UZAKI haha</div></blockquote>"This may be where I work, but it's also a place for me to relax" Wow man #WorkplaceGoals haha but really it's not because the workplace is great it's just that it doesn't have her. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (#UzakiChan02) I would like to give everyone a friendly reminder that do not judge people by their looks... until you see how wide their chest is lmao I'm sorry old man I gotta. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, we're going to introduce all the other characters in the series since Uzaki-chan has no friends we can get introduced to and Sakurai the senpai only has his workplace to talk about since it's basically his life now so... haha just joking I just hope there's more. Anyways, apart from the boss not laughing this much in decades (lmao), and living through the life philosophy of "a senpai-teasing a day keeps the doctor away", I think you can understand what this show is about so far especially with this episode. First one might be dry for starters, but this I think I can laugh to, and that's good. Let's talk story. Firstly, the cafe. It's where Sakurai works at, it's where he gets to relax without seeing that one kouhai of his, but you know, Uzaki had to ruin it. Like most parties that don't end well, his part-time work life also won't since you know, she kinda ruined it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But the old man seems to be enjoying it though, so yeah, I mean, us too so... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, the usual teasing and mocking commences, and I would say as much as the pace of the series is kinda slow leading up to jokes I can laugh to, it's not the first Anime that is done this way, so I'm giving that a pass. Then, it's with cats. Okay way too early to introduce that one cat in the theme song animations, but you know, we can start with a stray cat. Sadly, Sakurai hasn't had his share of cats too, considering he can't own one at his place. (Same, bro, same) Unlike Uzaki who just walks up to it like it's her friend, the senpai probably didn't get the joy of doing such things in life, and that is just sad haha even I'm roasting him too. But really, get yourselves a pet if you're still alone, man. Sadly, the cat ran away, and I thought this would lead up to a new character, but it probably led to the most iconic scene in this series since I knew of it through that collaboration with that DOAX free-to-play PC game: Uzaki getting stuck in a hedge. Yep, it's happening. Also, didn't expect panties so if you are freaked out like Sakurai maybe it's a good time to stop laughing at the jokes and leave haha. Unlike you guys who will puss out lol, I'm staying to watch Sakurai pull the poor girl out as if they were doing public sex. Yes, if that isn't implied I'm sorry you're still too pure for this Anime haha. So yeah, funny as it is, but I didn't expect this to one-up "Chio-chan" lol. Then, there's Sakurai at lunch in the canteen. Apparently Uzaki is so worried about her senpai that she can't even concentrate on eating even if she's 3 tables away from him. That's called love, Uzaki-chan. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> ANYWAYS, it's real dumb, again, but it's still funny to watch. Just like how Uzaki later asked Sakurai to help her write her report so she can still stay in college lol. But yeah, it's just those jokes, man, and I think I can live with it haha. I would love to give this series but... someone convince me to give the opening theme song please haha I don't want to but for Uzaki-chan I have to somehow ahaha <span title="*silence*">😐</span> To end this, I'm with the old man, so if you paid to watch this you're already getting your money's worth. He's just paying it forward with Sakurai's pay and free food for Uzaki-chan haha cya guys next week</div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--LqvEMZ5eFA/XxQM7V9pvPI/AAAAAAAA9Bo/yNAILxLdulYSMZvGkYPgoxPO1zZ7miywwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan02_boss.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so creepy I can't even<br />(lol)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OOHup4IyJ2c/XxQM7b-9MSI/AAAAAAAA9Bk/NQuHO0e0ePg3Nv2ASKQ5i8lYq-6nhgriwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan02_seethrough.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Okay Sakurai can I have your see through vision powers please?

That's why (Kazuya's) still a virgin" Wow man, you got burned by your friends so hard haha don't worry men are the worst lol</div></blockquote>Ugh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, dear author, can you not make this so elaborate with the document stack level of coincidences you have prepared for these two? I mean, I can't even bear to write this on my own novel series haha. In this new episode where the granny doesn't believe his grandson will get another girlfriend (#KanoKari02), guess what obaa-chan he got one but he got dumped so yeah, you... haven't... seen her before? Oops. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Besides him jerking off to his ex (man wtf how horny are you for her...?), you know, the coincidences keep stacking up. Besides Chizuru appearing at the college/university where he studies almost flipping his brain off (and maybe his friends), she is also his neighbour? Come on, author! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay it's probably worse if the ex lives next door because Kazuya you really don't want to hear her banging next door- We're talking about Chizuru, right? Haha okay. In the hole that is only going to get deeper (okay now the real talk lol) we'll talk about what happened this episode. Man, the drama keeps falling further into the abyss. So yes, Kazuya decides to (continue to) lie. And so far, it has not been great. Mostly because of the many things the two still has to cover up upon the fact that Kazuya... can't even get himself one. Excuse me, "another". <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We'll start with the grandmother since that's the most direct consequence so far. Of course, as of last week, we know that as a result of Chizuru appearing in the supposed family meeting with Kazuya's family, she had to assume her girlfriend identity (this is literally Ten-chan she's not even acting haha) as she gets paid. At this point though? I don't know. With her living next door, it seems convenient to just call for her to "help" appease the granny so that he won't see his elder get sad again, but man Chizuru is right though, you can't do this forever. Or can we? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And that's pretty much this series in a nutshell. Nothing but lies haha. But we're not over yet. Next up, is having to cover it up among Kazuya's friends. Well we'll assume Chizuru doesn't have any just because. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Even then, the boy has to deal with his friends (not forgetting family) shitting on his relationship status (ie. single) (I feel you bro, I just have nicer family members who won't do that haha) until he has to "reveal" that "he has a girlfriend". Sorry about the quotes but you get the idea haha. So yeah, problem is, as much as Chizuru can cover for him just by being a professional, Kazuya still cannot stop to lie in front of his friends and family, from the grandmother to his two buddies and now... to a drink party. With his ex in it. Okay, now what? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> For a moment, let's talk about Mami-chan. She's cute. Don't ask me why Kazuya can get his knob hard around her lol, but I guess it makes sense in a minute so bear with me for a while. (No seriously, stop jacking off please) (haha) The people around in the drinking party try not to talk about motokano around them, but you know, it's hard. Like my dic- ANYWAYS, (haha) after Kazuya takes it off for a moment wtf, he comes back to Mami-chan literally gloating on the new girl, telling her about whatever Kazuya is when they were dating for about a month if you recall, and thanks Chizuru for defending for him because man, if you weren't actually his girl you'll say the same things as she does. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Also, if you didn't get why Mami-chan asked for a "Virgin Breeze" and a "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/nama" target="_blank">nama</a>" refill off beer) Okay, serious talk though. Is this&nbsp;the best way for them two to split right now? That might be the easiest way out so far so hear me out, Kazuya. Ditch your (rental) girlfriend. NOW. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Mami-chan is helping you out here to put your dong down... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, Chizuru left probably leaving a 1-star review about her rental boyfriend (lol), and Mami-chan comes back with a final push, all while obviously if you have been paying attention, try to egg him off because you know, she knows his character. Probably also reason why she wants to ditch him, I would argue. But really for us viweres? If you think that Mami-chan is trying to f**k with us (mentally) (physically I don't mind too but I don't mean that here) (haha) then it's totally understandable. But man, did they make Yuuki Aoi here the sacrifice haha why. So... all in all in this episode... hey now Chizuru has a regular? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh, and it's for as long as the granny is alive by the way lol and if she lives through 120 we're f**ked haha bye</div><div>[NEXT WEEK IS BEACH EPISODE!!??

In the end I can't deal with giving the male vocals in unison somehow I don't know why, so I only gave the one song. Maybe next time, guys. I also took chance to give <b>yanaginagi's new single</b> a chance, and... it sounds okay so far. If I were to give it you'll know by next week haha I'm just not in the mood to listen to songs this week again might not be for a while tbh</div><br />On news... Twitter (haha), yay <b>Ikimonogakari is releasing a new single end August</b> so hype haha, many people are streaming online lives but with an entry fee so that sucks, unlike <b>cinema staff's reveal of their 2019 live on YouTube</b> which is limited in time and people can donate to recuperate their losses for not doing it physically (which I would argue is more acceptable for me especially without the pay wall), <b>the peggies' new single</b> has a release date now for Anime "KanoKari", <b>Natsukawa Shiina is releasing a new single</b> due August too which was revealed after another song cover on her YouTube channel (which isn't too bad, her new song, not the cover) (not into that style tbh but I am closer than ever before haha), <b>Amamiya Sora's 3rd album</b> is going to release on September following her only cute single so far start of the year and revealed some topic song preview which isn't cute lol, and let's hope we can give some&nbsp;<b>Anime "Uzaki-chan"&nbsp;theme songs</b> which are also releasing in the next couple of months. Man, thank goodness these guys are still dishing out songs those independent artists are not going too well especially those with independent labels haha Scenarioart is doing pretty well somehow despite all this<br /><br />So for next week I decided what the heck, those artists could use all the support with their new songs but not new releases and who knows when they'll happen, so we're doing <b>Digital Singles Week!!</b> (Why does it remind me of me being single-) So yes, I'll amass and listen to whatever has released so far from those artists who are reluctant of doing full on releases, and put it into my library if they are good. <b>Artists involved</b> will cover people I know to people I don't know as much as I can remember, from <strike>GLIM SPANKY</strike> Fujifabric to SCANDAL, to Yogee New Waves I think has one, to Yoru no Honki Dance, to Sambomaster, I hear Polkadot Stringray has one too, and more if I can find them. I'll try. No promises again, but I want to cover as much as I can. Maybe one song a day? Okay that sounds ridiculous how about one artist a day? That sounds reasonable, I'll listen on my way to work. Let's do this then! Oh and also <b>Earphone's new album</b> is out next week too so I'll take a day off lol so this plus 6 songs I think there are enough in this list so yeah hehe<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I think this has happened again, but yeah, remembering worldviews from I think GREAT PRETENDER until I thought of Anime "C" again. Like seriously, that was a one of a kind show. Not in terms of category because I'll sleep on another economy related series, but this one does the action well I might argue even better than "BLEACH", although it's not much, like, not a lot at all haha. Cya guys next week then, and by then... may I find motivation to live haha I don't know man but I know I will lift my spirits up when I see that package arriving in a couple more days hehe yes Phase 3 is coming muahahahaha it's like me spinning the Rotary Press lol bye</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
