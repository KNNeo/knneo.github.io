Thank goodness. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Sshh...</div><div><br /></div><div>Now that we're done with real life, let's go into a virtual life where I scam people for money, I met a girl with huge rack since high school and she is in university with me now, and I can still rent super popular girls who don't mind getting paid for me to be on top of them- Let's move on haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER01"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Speaking English so fluently must be nice!" Yeah Anime, that is going to hit you real quick real soon- Actually it's RIGHT NOW!! Haha</div></blockquote>You know how this Anime works when you realise even the one in the house is a scammer lol and the lady chased out probably the real one or maybe he's also one haha you know we can't trust those people. Politicians, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this bizarre watch of an episode of how to not fall for a scam (#GREATPRETENDER01) and then you realise the saddest people of this Anime are actually whoever are voicing the bad guy and/or the minor characters because they are going to get scammed and bullied by the main guys over and over it sucks to even be here as a newbie voice actor. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yes, even the guys who dubbed the English for them. *laughs on the floor rolling* But seriously man, they cannot carry this in English forever anyways so... haha. Okay, reasons to why I might continue to watch this, and reasons that why I might not after a couple more. Firstly, what is good about this series. The setting. The point that they played the game of putting this in a rather global scope, it's going to make things a lot more fun, and for main guy Makoto, he just lived the life of having to swindle a passenger into dropping his flight to L.A. so he can sit on it. You with me so far? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Next, obvious as stated forcefully in one sentence, is the level of scam you have to understand. Again, not really about inception, but to remember how far one action takes to make sure the objectives are met. Let's take the bigger picture as an example; Duping sort of a drug lord into buying a shit load of illegal drugs probably not worth much at all (in price, let alone in effect), from a candy can bottle. So yeah, you gotta set it up for such a thing. Upon hearing the news that this target has been bailed out, our foreigner guy <strike>Lampent</strike> Laurent&nbsp;set out to sell him a set of (probably normal) drugs (mind you) at a crazily high price. Why is it that high? He then demonstrated on the new girl the producer hired and it made her high as heck, let alone say what will happen if inside a hotel room ya know what I'm sayin'? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So, turns out that one was his hire, and Laurent&nbsp;tied it around by taking the girl from the producer, thus ending the session with her hire. You see where I'm going here? EVERYTHING, including how Laurent&nbsp;continues to bully the heck out of Makoto on his watch and wallet even though they are halfway across the globe, continues to amaze me. I mean, of course in this case it's just script writing, but at least it's impressive. It's like magic; once you know the trick it's not cool anymore. And trust me, I've watched "Breaking The Magician's Code" lol. Even then, it continues to captivate me at every corner, and if you aren't even half as suspicious of everything like Makoto you aren't smarter enough than this "doctor" lol. As practice, try thinking of how Laurent&nbsp;got Makoto to think he swallowed a mere candy and gone bonkers. (Answer if you want it, firstly he didn't know the truth, then is trolling of the two watches that were on his and the guy's wrists resemble the buddy and the old woman which he scammed, probably just similar not that Laurent&nbsp;stole from them BUT HE KNOWS) Lastly, why this shtick wouldn't stick for very long. Let's talk firstly about how hard it is to absorb all the content. Without proper explanations and flashbacks, it will be hard to catch up even in the slightest of content change that could be seen as a scam (for example, how Laurent&nbsp;already prepared to scam Makoto off his wallet by giving it to his buddy) (think about it, ending part with the buddy eating with his other bros), and how many times I've actually needed to pause the video because I have to think through it for a moment and not because I want to laugh at a joke or leave a note here. Then, there's the theme songs. There are no theme songs for this series. Yes, you heard me right. Freddie Mercury as the ending does not count. The opening is just pure music. Man, I really expected another one like Anime "ACCA" but I guess I'm not getting any. Yes, I feel scammed is what I mean. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Lastly, but this bothers me the least, is the cultural shift built into the pace of the series. It's fast, bro. Even the jokes. Makoto's family name didn't even last a second. I mean, I wasn't expecting jokes galore in this series, but when they appear, they disappear real quick. Again, this is a fast paced series, so there isn't much time to be lost in petty jokes anyways. Still, overall, I'll be giving this series a watch. Again, not all at once as if I own a Netflix subscription (man, give them 5 years, and I'll have to), so I'll follow the weekly schedule. And interestingly, this is two-cour, so this series will be long, so I have to make sure I'm willing to sit in this this ride where it's circles upon circles just coloured differently so that the scammer which is not me can know what is happening lol. No really, I physically need to take a break before we move on to the next one- I might actually watch this only on Saturdays. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> 'xcuse me, "exclusively". <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><div>[These are the only screens I took so... but really, the animation looks GREAT I'm just too blown off by the deception I didn't take anything down lol]</div><div></div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3w08KFzpC2A/XwnI4rMA0kI/AAAAAAAA83o/xkvNVNJ3G0MNpKAvPiLwYCCQAs2oFUJYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender01_high.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You can't tell but this girl wants d*ck lol<br />(You can see the tongue sticking out lmao)<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E6aWFpEI5FU/XwnI44_fFII/AAAAAAAA83s/rMyFGz4ASQ0aCAyqIIJp25yVmek2XihPACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender01_suits.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">They look like a great pair already, these two. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. Okay I got why they laughed at the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/edamame" target="_blank">Edamame</a>" joke so hard on Twitter lol and in case you need explanations "Edamura" is a family name, not something you can chew until your teeth goes lmao</div><div>P.P.S. Yes, to keep up appearances, Laurent is voiced by two different voice actors. Yes, Suwabe Jun'ichi can't do English I promise you haha you should've heard him speak in "Seitokai Yakuindomo"<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzakiChan01"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"After that thing we did yesterday? My hip still hurts!" Not a porno by the way ah why are you going away from me <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span></div></blockquote>Is it just me or did Anime make a series about me? Haha probably not true because there isn't a Uzaki-chan in my life and I say that in the nicest way possible because none of the girls in my life have TITS- Okay, let's talk about this Anime this guy has evil eyes I'm pretty sure he's from "Toradora!". <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anime references aside, let's talk about how this first episode (#UzakiChan01) of a long running anticipated series went. Yes, this animated stuff did not set a TV series ever since it exploded (literally) two years ago. Thanks Oozora Naomi-chan for the catch-up haha. In this series where you always get jebaited into hanging out with a rack (lmao), it's... man you can just binge-watch this yourself like a loner on the couch but <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, suffice it to say it's just hanging out with your dear kouhai, that's all. But first things first: if you think this might be a little too dull, you're missing something. You're missing jokes and/or content at every corner. I think I only realised this when I finished watching, but to make it simpler for you to understand if you watched fast-paced shows like "Kaguya-sama" last season it'll be hard to get the flow of this Anime. Even in the first episode, it doesn't deliver much. But that's the point, this is kind of a slice-of-life Anime in itself. It's just the couple (lol) hanging out and doing stuff and fooling around (yes, which beats doing it alone, for starters) and it may not be much, and it may be like this every episode, but if you can get the pace, it's actually done real well. The first episode, for starters, covers a little bit of everything there is to offer. Well, about Uzaki-chan in general lol. Story goes that they know each other in high school through the swimming club, and now they meet in college (university) again. Not that I know why she doesn't know the senpai is a loner, but yeah, since he's alone here might as well do things alone, right? WRONG. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I don't know if this is at the cost of her social circle or anything, but going through a year in college Uzaki decided that loner senpai is sad so she decides to keep him company. Well, while also tarnishing his reputation as much as possible and to sh*t on him in every corner. Man, I wish I can have such a girl in my life. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, a short and sweet series to catch on, but for now to be honest? It's not hitting me. Maybe because I'm hyped for the next show I'm going to watch this week (see below haha), but also that I, like the senpai, couldn't stand such an irritating girl while still enjoying her presence somehow without trying to get nosebleed or touch jellyfish while we're at it. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Again, there's that many things I can laugh at as friends without offending each other so I hope the minor characters will appear soon to spice up the content here no really it looks like a porno now lmao. The theme songs aren't easy to give for starters maybe the ending will do, and the cast is... I mean, I'll give Osaka accented Naomi-chan anytime of the day. I just feel that... that it's a little dry. Not her h*men per say but- Okay we gotta stop with these lol I can't blow my load in this week lmao okay bye<br /></div><div></div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CtQgWYAd7BA/XwnKMo_O6MI/AAAAAAAA838/cJvJBwwJJc884Q3Rfh5i7IqU5-VDo-hyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan01_senpai4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This can be used when the senpai wants to punch her and/or can't resist her cuteness haha<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1K5KZ7LmLKo/XwnKNR3a8LI/AAAAAAAA84A/5HU8OIEBLCkZf50_VBxVkQPlzxGNDgVLwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan01_hip.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is actually a great way to show spraining of hips haha no really this is not a boob joke<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

The senpai after seeing Uzaki-chan on the massage chair be like I got a boner let's stop and then he says "Save that for when (you're) at home" Yeah his load? Haha this series is great to make fun of</div><div>[GIF!!! And NO I'm NEVER going to do anything that involves Uzaki-chan's huge rack- Okay never mind on second thought haha]</div><div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKari01"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo, Okarishimasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Could it be... his girlfriend?" "No way; It's Kazuya we're talking about" Wow your mom and dad just forgot you had a real one for a month? What?? Haha</div></blockquote>Man, that was quite an intro. Short and sweet, I must say. Not so sweet though. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> And I thought I had to worry about ecchi references, but yeah, I had to, I guess. Haha anyways, let's talk about this most anticipated series for the season for me. As you can see in the first episode (#KanoKari01) it's everything this show as to offer, and more! So, story first. Story goes that Kazuya is probably a loner who can't get himself a girlfriend but did, for like about a month. Hey, he already is way better off than me already so he wins haha, but suffice it to say he got dumped. Probably for another guy because you know, women are fickle. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Is this what it feels like to be a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normie</a>? Well, Kazuya is halfway there already haha. Yeah, just that he's alone again. So yeah, he spent days crying I suppose, and in impulse decided to you know, let it off on a rental girlfriend. Well, I probably won't do that to feel better about myself, but hey, he got his way, so sure. He picked specifically Mizuhara Chizuru, probably popular amongst customers she's served since she goes a step out to play her role real well, prepares for whoever she is serving to so provide the best dating experience worth anyone's time, and... she introduced herself to his grandmother. Wait, what? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay but before that, we gotta talk about Kazuya himself. I guess it's kind of mixed in feelings, but think of it as like, him wanting to get out of being alone, but also, then to realise that all this is faked because he checked the online forums about how wonderful of a date she was to everyone else. Man, if this isn't the biggest relation and irony to idolism EVER I can't even. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, he realised that soon enough since his girl didn't even give two sh*ts about him to not let him know what true love is, so yeah, he kind of lets it out on Chizuru the next time he booked her. Pretty bad for a gentleman though, as Chizuru then drags him out of public eyes to obviously, reprimand him for his actions. Seriously, it's like sitting down there watching a magic show and saying "this is all fake you idiots" or like, spoiling the movie as it's being played in a movie theatre. It's just not good, bro. (Also, thanks for the scolding, Ten-chan) (haha) But yeah, surprisingly, the rental girlfriend still has professionalism all around her, as she spares no little time left to still be with this pathetic dude while he... just got news that his grandmother had collapsed. Well, normally people would've just called the "date" off you know, but nope, this one stays true to her job somehow lol. You can guess what happened next haha. Kazuya of course, got a chance to "reveal" that he has a "girlfriend" amongst all expectations of him specifically his granny, that you know, her dear grandson found a partner or something. I don't know why this show has that much sexual references or this is part of the author's style, but as irritating as it is it's also a good joke, I would argue. Moving on, the old woman then wants to brag it to the others in the hospital, only to then let Chizuru realise that her granny is here too, so.. yeah, to not let the cat out of the bag, they shoved themselves right into it. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, more like under a blanket in a vacant hospital bed, but still. (Man, this series is going to make me pull out so many sick jokes I can stop watching porno now-) May be stereotypical for any romance Anime I would say, but you know, it's a good way to know each other. Especially the smell haha ugh. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, they got found out while escaping because you know, misunderstandings, but hey, at least it got two grandmothers happy. But yeah, it was all a lie anyways... or is it? Okay, I think we got spoiled from the trailers real good, but you know, we can ignore those for now haha. Surprisingly, Kazuya then found out that this "girlfriend" of his... is at his school?? Yep, and what a way to end the first episode. The show does give a lot of background for plot, a lot of circumstances for misunderstandings, and a lot of adult stuff that we shouldn't talk too much about and I'll not jerk off to just because. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> But what Chizuru said to wrap up this first episode is summarising of the story here: there isn't anyone who isn't lonely. So yeah, bring up that rental partner app... <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, a wonderful episode to start the series. Maybe too perfect, like our girl her Chiruzu. Next up though, the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/motokano" target="_blank">motokano</a> is coming back for his boy...? Ooo now if the conflict between women isn't half the reason why you came... to watch this series lol, you got another thing coming. Boy, will I look forward to next episode. Again, it has been A WHILE since I got some Yuuki Aoi-chan being cute so please forgive me if I go crazy next episode maybe I should let some steam off before watching this next week HAHA&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/nandemonai" target="_blank">NANDEMONAI</a>&nbsp;HAHAHA CYA NEXT WEEK lol goddamn this is just a pit for sex jokes haha</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q7T2MIBS2Uw/XwmLX1wLevI/AAAAAAAA83A/d9yH3QU3-ScwYO--gRRRL1z3fcmlH3ovACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokari01_kazuya5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Haha they can't draw it downwards since it's too many so they drew it horizontally<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Sksgaw6h50A/XwmLmAtSYeI/AAAAAAAA83E/XzmQLsTlbbIZdW-N7_1REPlVgYzcqMbKACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokari01_laid.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Woah didn't know I was watching a porno haha excuse me while I clean up lmao<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

I did visit indie artists site Audioleaf again but to not much returns, maybe because I wasn't in the mood for it, and probably also why the heck <b><a href="http://www.audioleaf.com/lightpalette/" target="_blank">Light Palette</a></b> is suggested again since I saw them a couple of years ago I think, and I missed a full album since then, like, a year after I gave one song from them. If only their album will be on Apple Music and not just sold physically on Amazon Japan I wouldn't be stuck here without a review now haha sadded<br /><br />On news concerning music and that is on Twitter, <b>nano.RIPE announced their 10th anniversary best album</b> which has new songs and probably many more I've never given in their decade of making music I'm sorry, <b>ClariS announced their best album for their 10 years</b> and this time around it's going to be all Clara and Karen versions including a campaign to suggest songs that they can sing solo (lol), <b>Amamiya Sora's new album</b> is confirmed without much detail, <b>SCANDAL released a new digital single</b>, I think <b>Yogee New Waves released a digital single</b> too, and <b>vivid undress' new music video</b> for their upcoming mini-album is... not what I expected, to say the least. Let's hope the rest of their mini-album isn't like this haha<br /><br />So we're probably going through another week of emptiness as I try to find time to find new songs to listen to... or not. I really am not in the mood too anyways, but man is this an evil cycle now. Finding new songs makes me happy, so not doing so will not get me up for work too, so that's bad. I really need to try next week hehe promise me future self that you will do more</div><div><br /></div><div>[P.S. EARNIE FROGs sounds great, so maybe I'll listen to their new E.P. a listen then. Hey we got something to listen next week!! lol]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I need to shower now it's not early and I have to GO TO OFFICE TO WORK TOMORROW ugh I hate this already haha.
