<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #39</h2>
<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Nr2bsYETHY/X3B8699tbXI/AAAAAAAA-hM/D17Hlzsjkz07pRfduEL5HLHZd-nIlaNlQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan12_ami4.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Yeah, I'm going to spoil here real quick, Anime "KanoKari" and "Uzaki-chan" both have sequels in place after their final episodes aired on Friday. Yeah. So yay, congrats, I guess. Now I'm going to join all those weebs in watching stuff that they never get bored with and never giving new series a chance lol just joking look at the next season preview I'm giving new stuff. <div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, that package is coming soon, I only realised I'm due to ship already a day   after all of the individual packages arrived, so you know, won't do much of a   difference because this forwarding service international shipping fees is kind   of a ripoff (I miss Suruga-ya already haha), and even then it'll take weeks to   arrive. So... I opted for the slightly cheaper rate since I'm going to miss   that single review for the month already haha Nan-chan~ </div><div><br /></div><div>  So, Anime, I guess. And considering how things go for next season ie. most of   them will start from next week, there will be no break then. To, you know,   catch up on manga or movies or whatever because I'm lazy and I want to   continue making that profile list page on GitHub haha okay let's watch   Anime<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER12">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "We have people looking at us..." And then Cynthia's colleague be like OMG       haha why she can't have someone to like her? Geez...     </div>  </blockquote>  Wow, right up into pace, the team is already working rounds in London. As   expected of the team with Laurent in it haha Makoto you still sour about this?   *laughs* In this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER12) of James Coleman which is   definitely not that skinny guy you see in the intro because it's fat af haha,   he's sleeping with an old woman. *laughs* Okay, who knows what about James'   marriage life so I wouldn't ask, but hey, he's living the life right now. But   man, is this so far the best episode of the series because CYNTHIA!!! Haha   man, her in love is too good how did they make the best woman in an- oh this   is original Anime. *laughs* So, story. Firstly, about Coleman. He's an art   appraiser. He's an auctioneer. He does this thing every so once in a while,   and somehow certain paintings are always bought by this rich woman Fara. But   it's not just that, because besides having a secret art gallery which Makoto   and Kudo managed to enter to see the sights (as well as plant a listening   device), it's also the place where she keeps her... lover's most prized   possessions. Yes, coincidentally, it's James here. I know. Unbelievable,   right? But hey, you gotta lie you gotta lie. *laughs* So as you can see, and   as Laurent pointed out, James likes the paintings he likes being kept in good   hands which is not him because he can't afford it anyways, and Fara is   after... whatever his charm is I don't know. He's a good liar? *laughs*   Anyways, as we have found out soon enough, things are starting to pick up from   the team's side to sort of, have a hold of his life and situation. To, you   know, do whatever drunk Cynthia wants out of this heist haha. I guess it's   selling the painting again at a high price, right? So yeah, Laurent went into   the auction, crashed it by buying out the Snow of London at 30 million pounds   (that is a a lot of money FYI) literally robbing it away from Fara who then   got a scolding from her... "art advisor" lol (really the husband believed it?)   (yes apparently she's not single?), but also, is the start of their plan.   Mainly (1) to sell it to Fara while earning money from it ie. make a fake   painting so effectively they got it back for free and (2) make James furious   such that Abbie can get a job under him? Haha, spying or whatever, it worked   for the latter, which of course, we will see that be of use at some point. For   now, it's not enough to ruin James' career, but we will soon, I'll promise you   that. Then, the flashbacks, for Cynthia. First arc we had Makoto. Second arc,   we had Abbie. Now, it's her turn. And like her, we don't know many of her   story. Story goes that there is this painter, who sells replicas for survival,   saw this beautiful woman at the local cafe. I mean, I agree Thomas, that if I   were a painter in London and saw such a beauty? I'll ask her to model for my   artwork. *thumbs up* So yeah, as you can see, as time passes, they sort of got   involved in each other's lives, making and selling artwork, trying to live by.   I legit thought the ring was for them, but nope, or else this would be even   more exciting consdering how Cynthia is effectively single right now.   *laughs* Anyways, they aren't living the life just yet, especially Thomas, and   it was not until James Coleman appearing in their lives that made a   difference. So finally, how this ties all together. Sadly, what is between Thomas and Cynthia is not an affair   or whatever thing yet unlike with James. Well, not yet anyways haha. But, the   two kind of tied together mainly because, instead of Thomas' work of drawing   Cynthia selling for money (which man, I'll buy them, AND her haha), James saw   excellent potential in Thomas... making counterfeit artwork. Uh oh. We got an   evil villain on our hands. Because so far, we know of his reputation as a man   of art, so whatever he approves will literally be the actual work, or - hear   me out - an actual facsimile. Yes, this guy's playing dirty now. Surprisingly   though, he may not be able to tell the difference. Because since he said he   can be deceived by Thomas' replication of artwork, Cynthia (today) probably   thinks she can deceive him again. So yeah, I guess we're going in that   direction now. What happens next? Man, I just want more wholesome love stories   of Cynthia. But yeah, I better brace myself for the breakup and/or her   relationship with James just in case haha thank goodness this isn't like Sam   from the previous arc who is NOT straight haha bye</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nHPSDD-2-wE/X3B9TzCq0RI/AAAAAAAA-hY/rl4lwn7u1NIIPhSI4DX3xAuL4jppTzdZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender12_art.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        James Coleman might not appreciate this but I think this is a work of         art on a work of art<br />(I got no money to buy this though haha)       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WpYCQhVBE6o/X3B9VN7vNOI/AAAAAAAA-hc/hUmEj8i7jg8GVrAOv7eZEFR5qbxJnSggACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender12_couple2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">lol<br /></td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Uh oh. *laughs*     </div>  </blockquote>  And then you realise Uzaki-chan is always finding you, Sakurai, because..   you're the only one she knows. Well, knows well. Her other friends do not   count if they don't appear in this animation lmao. In this final episode of   the season (#UzakiChan12) because I believe you've read the first paragraph of   this post lol, last week's ending was a farce. *laughs* Oh well, really   thought she was pregnant or something haha you know she can't sit on the floor   anymore or something because it'll be hard to get up. *giggles* Anyways, I'm   those guys who cheer when <strike>Uzaki</strike> big chests appear in the   swimming club as managers lol this is going to turn into a porno in a minute   haha. So, story, I guess? I mean, it is the final episode (for now), so I   wonder what's going on. Turns out, they gotta spice it up, right? *prepares   rice cooker* So let's talk about it. *laughs* So, I assume, in this Anime   filler of a final episode, we talk about the past, and get drunk. Man, isn't   this life though? Firstly, more flashbacks. Well, thanks to Ami-chan asking   about Uzaki's past, we now know more about her first encounter with the   senpai. For starters, she wasn't initially swimming in the club. She's supposedly just in as a   manager along with her (then) friend (lol) who dragged her into helping out   the swimming club because you know, the girl wants her senpai. Hey, guess who   also got her senpai down the line. *laughs* Yeah, friend I hope you got laid   because Hana-chan did- Ah. *laughs* And yes, it really sounds like she has   been changing her tone and kind of, you know, losing her own tone in conversation   nowadays and sounding like Sakurai, at least, from an outsider's perspective.   I guess you get influenced by peoples' tones once you hang out long enough   with them anyways. I only get my influences from YouTube videos lmao. Then,   Sakaki recalls Sakurai being drunk. Well, he doesn't really now because he   knows it sucks (the toilet trip, I assume), so as matured as he is in   responsible drinking, he controls himself. So yeah, since Uzaki wants to break   him (haha), the friend rats on him and teaches him a way to break down his   defences. So drink at home, don't give him water to dilute his drinking, and   since Uzaki gets drunk easily, pretend to drink along. Haha NOW we can get him   drunk lmao. *gets a bowl of rice and sits down* Now for the fun part. *laughs*   So yeah, nothing much happens as Sakaki described, since drunk Sakurai is just   sloppy, he talks little and is very tired. So yeah, not very entertaining   compared to Uzaki-chan, of course. On top of that, his words make of a very   embarrassed Uzaki, so she might as well be drunk anyways, is what I assume she   was doing after hearing about whatever "love" thing that is going on in   Sakurai's mind haha. Sakaki drops by to see what happened unlike Ami-chan (lol   hey don't say you weren't invited haha), and puts them to sleep for the night   because you know, it's kinda late. And in case you didn't   <strike>see the official Twitter spoiler screenshots until you watched it     yourself</strike>  notice why the camera angles for both of them are so close up, it's because   they can't reveal until the next morning that they... remember Sakurai only   had one bed at his place? Yeah, it's big enough to fit two people now.   *laughs* *gets another bowl of rice and chopsticks* So yeah, that was quite a   night. And as Uzaki thought she can do this experiment again (without thinking   that how bad this will hurt anyone's liver), Sakurai reminds her that summer   vacation's over, <i>bitch</i>. *laughs* And that's it, actually. I know   there's the last part where *empties bowl and refills* but you get the idea.   This Anime's so good with plain rice lmao okay that's not the point. The point   is that this series, apart from the joke that is Uzaki x Sakurai, is probably   just the interactions between the characters, the mood, and overall, what this   slice-of-life wants to represent: going outdoors. I know this is real   irrelevant at this time of year or even this year to be honest, but I'm sure   we'll remember this to come back to watch this again because... there's season   two!! That's right, more laughter, more awkward situations as much as the   author can conjure lol, and because we have an interesting ending of back to   school featuring new character Kiri which is Hana's younger brother AND two   other new characters waiting to come in to this Anime series (see tweet from the author,   <a href="https://twitter.com/syokumutaiman/status/1309495351292825600" target="_blank">here</a>), I can't wait to see what more episodes we'll get from whoever wants to   join in the feast of rice haha no really we need more bowls, chopsticks and   rice cookin' because IT IS&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/tamaranai" target="_blank">TAMARANAI</a>  haha (as in irresistible) hey this Anime is great slice-of-life what can I say</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Eyda4vI6l3M/X3B8qI2AidI/AAAAAAAA-g4/lfnOhqrGc74TbJCEG30o4eZUE_eTT9J2ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan12_uzaki1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        How is this cute I don't even know<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-liSg2rigm44/X3B8qNceTiI/AAAAAAAA-g8/YHRqe8yrd8489fcHY_cdYspKVHX_L9-xACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/uzakichan12_back.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Yet another display of back pain through animation haha<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

But I already       am, Ruka-chan. *laughs* Oh you meant Kazuya     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay FINALLY Kazuya has woken up to see the reality in front of him and   appreciating Ruka-chan has his girl. You f**king idiot so stop thinking about   Chizuru already...? Haha you think this will end right if it's like this?   Haha, naïve are we, huh. In this final episode for the season (#KanoKari12) we   have a lovely scene where Kazuya is literally confessing to Ruka-chan which is   seriously OUT OF THIS WORLD RIGHT NOW lol but I mean seriously and- Oh wait.   Last week, huh. Yeah, totally forgot about it I thought Kazuya was   hallucinating Chizuru and Mami-chan while confessing to this girl in front of   him lmao. So, story...? Firstly, about the two girls in a karaoke room first,   I guess, then we'll talk about Kazuya. So, if it's not obvious enough because   even Kazuya figured it out, Mami-chan is renting Chizuru out. Very awkwardly,   because why would you do that, knowing that you're that ex, and somehow you   should be like everyone else not knowing about this... relationship between   Kazuya and this rental girl... hey again, it's complicated. Well, to   Mami-chan, it's not that complicated. Just... stop it. By doing all this of   course, I suppose she has this message sent across those two (yes Kazuya is   hearing at the door because it's his workplace lol), and throughout this date   sort of, I think even with the interactions on the bridge, it's still really   obvious that both of their real emotions are... nowhere to be found lmao. Like   really, think about it. Mami-chan is totally jealous about this relationship   and totally wants to ruin it like the evil villain she wants to not be   somehow, Chizuru really wonders about her relationship with Kazuya at this   point outside of money which I might say is not even important anymore, and   Kazuya is a crybaby haha. But thankfully, he didn't interfere so this will   play out properly, but honestly, if this is not Anime filler than I would   argue that it's not enough. I know this would not make of a great romcom   (lol), but hey, author, you wrote in a b*tch make her behave like one. You   know, go out to ruin other peoples' lives because so far you've not been doing   much to fan the flames. Hey, maybe it's me who saw all those dramas as a kid   lol that was such bad influence, but yeah, that subtlety is too weak to make a   case. But yeah, maybe Chizuru pleading to Mami-chan's feelings about Kazuya   did hit it, I guess. Like the "it's our problem" shtick- hey Mami-chan you'll   make of a good actress. *laughs* Then, the situation at hand. Which is why I   say this might sound like a filler episode to end the   <strike>series</strike> season because it's just another summary of Kazuya's   fake relationship with Chizuru to the whole world at this point right now, but   also, I guess, another doki moment where Kazuya accidentally spouts out that   he wants her body haha. What, Kazuya, that's all you want, you pervert.   *laughs* All in all, as I'm hearing the new insert song not by halca but by   Amamiya Sora herself, I must say this Anime still leaves me with mixed   emotions, and me nowhere near satisfied because clearly, Kazuya is in no   position to talk about his love life as pretty much everything is in a mess   right now, which would tide over this past year (in Anime time) (it has been   this long?) of his life, so yeah... I hope there is some conclusion at some   point even in the manga. But for now, because I know from the official Twitter   already and yes the very last part of the episode was kind of cryptic but   SEASON TWO!! WOOOO!!! Haha okay I wasn't this excited about Uzaki-chan so stop   faking it. *laughs* But yay maybe, because I didn't expect to hang out this   long, but clearly, this Anime is making bucks. *laughs* So yeah, more of this   drama I guess. I might add that if you are going to miss   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/majime" target="_blank">majime</a> Chizuru   'cos this is her new surname now lol, not b*tchy enough Mami-chan who is not   bad enough to piss me off but can't stop being jealous until we know of her   true feelings which is never, Ruka-chan which is MVP every week since she   appeared until Sumi-chan who became MVP for like an episode because this week   doesn't feature her lmao. Man, can't wait for more clarifications next season   imagine of the Anime stopped here I would say this ended way worse than I has   expected, to be honest. I mean, what kind of ending is this? I'm just not   convinced. The laughs are great, the romance is mostly fake, and I can only   idolise on the girls in this series. Seriously, I'm as bored as Mami-chan haha   just joking not that farfetched but still. Anyways, to end this... KAZUYA YOU   FUCKING WUSS!!! YOU MAN, TILL THE END!! UGH I'm quitting this series haha cya   guys next season </div><div>  [This is the most screencaps I've taken of Kazuya so far this series of him because he's snooping on them in the karaoke room so here you go]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TxHtWzsq7GE/X3B79D3WqSI/AAAAAAAA-gk/3gpUC4RPhME346Aov2e15zolgg2M1hUQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokari12_kazuya1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        When people <strike>ask</strike> find out I like a certain someone in         class lol<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5bC6ergVWrw/X3B79MWXEmI/AAAAAAAA-go/wpKdx6NwnYU7q6cnlVfheSM5DTxRoDjjQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokari12_kazuya6.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        This is just pathetic, both in person and in image quality lmao<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Me." Alright haha I'm not   masochist </div><div>  P.P.S. "Why are Mami-chan and Chizuru together??" Well because Mami-chan is   lesbian? Haha Kazuya I can't believe you dated someone who doesn't like dudes   lol (yes I'm Mami-chan mode right now haha)<br />  [Sorry for the Kazuya screencaps so here are some girls to compensate for that   haha] </div><div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1345" data-original-width="1280" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--hanWf9yEkc/X3B7VHCtcLI/AAAAAAAA-gU/IyKAbUOQW4A3fzcjBjUEtJyeoY5UwZpGwCLcBGAsYHQ/w305-h320/kanokari12_ruka5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="305" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        A large image to end the season amirite??

It's been some time since I give Ede-chan (Hondo         Kaede) any magic related Anime a chance remember Tejina Senpai?         <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/142261/Senpai">Wait.</a>        *laughs*<br />      </li>      <li>        If I don't give Kito Akari as <strike>waifu</strike> wife Anime         <b>"Tonikaku Kawaii" [premiers October 2nd 2020]</b> I must be crazy. I         kind of know the author's background with "Hayate no Gotoku" series         because I kind of watched my sis watch it lol, so I can guess the level         of humour and story we're going on with over here. Other than that,         naming this the Akarin waife Anime is not an exaggeration this is how         you marry her lol the photobook doesn't count       </li>      <li>        I know <b>"Munou na Nana"</b> is a once in a blue moon Ookubo Rumi as         main series, but man, am I not any bit interested in the story haha like         seriously       </li>      <li>        "Project Rescue Our Princess" lmao that's not the Anime title for         <b>"Maou-jou de Oyasumi"</b> though it's just a cute princess Anime with         Minase Inori as main girl. Who could resist? I can haha. Unless I'm         interested in like, the Zelda/Peach's perspective waiting for the hero         to rescue her, I might give this a try. And she sleeps all day?? I'm out         lmao       </li>      <li>        So <b>"Ikebukuro West Gate Park"</b> is like the Yazkuza series? I'm         good I've watched till Kiwami 2 from someone's livestreams I could use a         break haha       </li>      <li>        <b>"Adachi to Shimamura"</b> is like my relationship with my best         friend: Not because one of us is gay but he likes Mikuu and I like         Akarin. I guess you can't call us gay haha they are not lesbian either         (More along the lines of         <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shoujoai" target="_blank">shoujo-ai</a>, as clarified by the site)       </li>      <li>        <b>"Yuukoku no Moriarty"</b> sounds like a different interpretation of         Sherlock Holmes series but seriously, no girls?? I'm out haha       </li>      <li>        <b>"Ochikobore Fruit Tart"</b> is a comeback story but in case you         didn't notice, it's filled with newbie female voice actresses. Yes. It's         an actual idol Anime series *wink* Idolmaster *wink* but worse. Is         Hikasa Youko the only cast I know of? Haha this Anime sucks lol       </li>      <li>        And in case you wonder why         <b>"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season" [premiers December 7th           2020]</b>        is at the end of this season because, as you should have seen by the         premier date, it's... probably a season and a little more long. Yeah,         we'll see how this goes I'll still watch it till the end though I want         to see the... I forgot what species they are already haha       </li>    </ul>    In short, if I will watch any of them they are denoted by [premier air     dates] which range from "I'll give Episode 1 a try" to "I'm watching this     <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2020/02/tenth-book-worth-of-photos-end-route.html">till the end and beyond</a>    because of Akarin" lol I'm going to hate Mondays in December because of     Attack on Titan again   </div>  <div>    <br />    <blockquote class="tr_bq">      <div style="text-align: center;">        <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>        <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>      </div>    </blockquote><div>Well, this week was kind of week in Klassic Note, though I would say I really am not in the mood to give new songs and am trying to be stricter these days because man, are there real good songs this year to compete with. So, clearing up <b>Cocoro Auction's new mini-album</b> and rejecting <b>DENIMS' new mini-album</b> (haha yes they only deserve this much), this week there's <b>nano.RIPE's best album</b> which... I guess I can give more than a few. Distracting me at work with rather mundane tunes since they have already done this for so long, but then again I realised this is what got me into them, so yeah? I'll try to give more if I can like some more of their melodies if I feel like it. Good chances, this will not go well. And as with Anime "KanoKari" end of the (first) season <b>Amamiya Sora's new song</b> for the Anime is... kinda okay, but clearly given to the Anime which we hope, will be in a future release at some point considering why not just put it in her recent album. That element of surprise might not be necessary imo. I guess they can't talk about it which will suck if they have to wait till this week, I guess.</div><div><br /></div>    In news on Twitter and beyond whatever because I can't remember this paragraph's intro every time, <b>KANA-BOON's new single</b> will be that firefighting Anime's new opening theme song with single out due November, I may actually give more than one song now that <b>Waki Azumi's new music video</b> is sounding more prospective than ever if I haven't got bored of giving Anime songs, we talked about <b>Amamiya Sora's new song</b> already it's kind of obvious effort for the Anime itself with overflowing budget lol, I didn't know <b>YuNi's new song actually had a single</b> coming literally next week, and I promise you I'm trying to search the Internet for that <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai x Ikimonogakari</b>'s Yoshioka Kiyoe (the vocalist) collaboration on TV which I don't own cable of. The last one might be impossible to find haha I just want to see artists of generations interact man it's all I've wanted haha<br />    <br />    So for next week, besides the one I mentioned above which is <b>YuNi's new single</b> because I think they realised the ending song for Anime "Uzaki-chan" is selling so they can afford to write another song and release it in a CD which I may be able to review and buy who knows, and man this was some time coming, <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</b>. The latter though, it was announced two months ago, and the last time I've given her anything is two years ago, and I know I've already given the one song because of lyricist yuiko, but hey, let's keep a clean slate so I can review this properly when the time comes. I'll look forward to this one but yeah I'll remember YuNi-san too I promise.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    And introducing Friend Mode in... you know, that GitHub Profile Page I'm     maintaining and I swear those online games I'm playing inspired me to do     this because, you know, 2 is better than 1. Especially girls I like, I can always use more of them. For now, it's just really troublesome to actually input data into both profiles, so that's kind of a pain. Sadly though, since I'm using a single source, this is kind of unavoidable let's see if I can improve this next week then. Cya guys next time, and until next week... Hmm I don't know. I would ask you to wait for the package with me but if you're not into Nan-chan, Akarin, Moeshi and/or Futon-chan then I'm sorry haha let's hope it arrives sooner or later<br />      </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
