ARGH I HATE   MYSELF!!! You're welcome, Japan economy haha <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>  Hey, welcome back. Okay, before we start, I promise you that this is THE LAST   ORDER of buying used bromide photos FOR THE YEAR. I PROMISE. May I be struck   by lightning if I do this again. (uh oh) (haha) Also, new goods do not count   lmao these are used ones it's different hehe *phew* </div><div><br /></div><div>  So, if you wondered how fast I did to click on these stuff, think again. I was   <b><i>very</i></b> fast. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So without further ado, let me talk a little   more about what SHOULD have been the PUSS back in April where I did indirectly   shop on THE SAME STORE which only delivered 3 items after 6 rounds of   cancellations <span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE ORIGIN<br />It all   started, with this: </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <a href="https://www.suruga-ya.com/en" target="_blank"><img border="0" data-original-height="80" data-original-width="920" height="56" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gn97FYjI2cY/X1Mbbf_y7iI/AAAAAAAA-CE/a3kegF7POc8hpM-XcFj_Y6IRsH5xe8oAwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h56/global_banner_en.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div>  This banner. When I was window shopping around the actual Japanese site of   Suruga-ya, one of the only few places that openly sell these bromide photos   online. Normally, if you visit Japan (which I have never, but my friend did   lol and bought me some back then because he knew) (of Minase Inori, FYI)   (Inorin!!~ lol) you will visit those Anime stores? Yes, and among some of   them, they sell used goods, from figurines to CDs to posters to... yes, these.   Again, this is technically illegal because they are not for re-sale (you can   see that on the photos themselves), but you know, this is also the only way to   (1) catch back in time to get older ones and (2) get rare stuff like those   involving fanclubs. As you can see in recent posts I have made an effort to   buy them in tandem with releases from magazines to live event goods as much as   I can to compensate for this... piracy haha (hey I did spend money on this),   but yeah, the truth is, buying them directly when it's actually released even   if it comes with as a special for a magazine, is still more worth it than   this. </div><div><br /><br />BUT WHY</div><div>  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container cheaper-table">    <tbody>      <tr>        <th style="border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px;">        </th>        <th><a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-auction-house-journey-part-deux.html">The Auction House<br />Journey Part Deux</a></th>        <th><a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-pandemic-upturn-shopping-spree-2020.html">PUSS 2020</a></th>        <th>          The Cheaper Option         </th>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">          Source(s)         </td>        <td>          Yahoo Auctions Japan         </td>        <td>          Mercari, Suruga-ya via Rakuten<br />          All via Buyee         </td>        <td>          Suruga-ya.com         </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">No. of items</td>        <td>          22</td>        <td>          63</td>        <td>          27</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Item Average</td>        <td>          ~480yen</td>        <td>          ~370yen</td>        <td>          ~233yen</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Subtotal</td>        <td>          10550yen</td>        <td>          23348yen</td>        <td>          6280yen</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Service Fee(s)</td>        <td>          7861yen</td>        <td>          21880yen</td>        <td>          500yen</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Int'l Shipping</td>        <td>          1130yen</td>        <td>          0yen</td>        <td>          1050yen</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Grand Total</td>        <td>          19541yen</td>        <td>          45228yen</td>        <td>          7830yen</td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Items/Shipping Ratio</td>        <td>54/46</td>        <td>          52/48</td>        <td><b>          80/20</b></td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption">Money Wasted On</td>        <td>          Domestic Shipping Fees</td>        <td>          Item Unit Prices, Service Fees</td>        <td>          -</td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table>  <div><br /></div>  Let's talk about ALL the <u>advantages</u> about this specific package.   Firstly, it's the shipping rate. <b>International shipping rate</b>. At this   point, flat rate of 1050yen. No joke. They even offer shipping discounts (at   this rate btw) with minimum purchase from 10000yen (which of course I did not   do and I COULD HAVE haha). And that's it. For comparison I pay more   international shipping buying a CD directly from a Japan store eg. HMV Japan,   and thank goodness that previous package was void of shipping which was about   3000yen? Yeah, now you wonder why I was so dumb half a year ago. Then, it's   the direct shopping service&nbsp;I get from this approach. Considering this   website is <b>more updated on stock</b> compared to the nightmare I   experienced for a month going through Rakuten as described in the first PUSS   2020 post (lol), this one was surprisingly easy to deal with. Out of stock   notices are easily seen (even if there isn't a filter on search which is fine   I can't read the Google Translate from Japanese anyways lol more on that   later), as you can see <b>their service is fast</b> because I ordered on   Tuesday (yes, ie. 1st September 2020) and it arrived today, and   <b>their charges</b> for this service is only - you heard it right - 500yen   flat. Yes. For comparison the previous "scam" was 500 PER ITEM. F**K haha </div><div><br /></div><div>This will be the closest to me actually shopping on the store in Japan without going there btw</div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pdWIZFM9lbk/X1MeBHCHe-I/AAAAAAAA-CU/FWSTDfaxAT08b7WDebmIbtq7v5T2YxjoQCLcBGAsYHQ/s3312/screencapture-suruga-ya-en-mypage-order-detail-49037-2020-09-05-12_49_00.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3312" data-original-width="949" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pdWIZFM9lbk/X1MeBHCHe-I/AAAAAAAA-CU/FWSTDfaxAT08b7WDebmIbtq7v5T2YxjoQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/screencapture-suruga-ya-en-mypage-order-detail-49037-2020-09-05-12_49_00.jpg" /></a>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        For reference<br />(<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pdWIZFM9lbk/X1MeBHCHe-I/AAAAAAAA-CU/FWSTDfaxAT08b7WDebmIbtq7v5T2YxjoQCLcBGAsYHQ/s3312/screencapture-suruga-ya-en-mypage-order-detail-49037-2020-09-05-12_49_00.jpg" target="_blank">click!</a>)<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>There are still <u>disadvantages</u> about this though, like the   <b>limited availability of certain newer items</b> because all the popular   ones are already sold out the moment they are posted (or even claimed in shops   in Japan since at this point people can leave their houses), but still. Also,   if you see the unboxing below, you'll also notice   <b>their approach to shipping</b>: one big box, but without any padding. Yeah.   Then again, there isn't much to protect besides from scratches so this isn't   much of a dealbreaker. More importantly, there are <b>missing items</b> in   this order, as you can see above. Okay, not that they screwed it up, calm   down, but they are likely out of stock by the time I wanted to order them and   they did not update the website (<span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> find some deja vu there?) so at this   point it's about a 10% miss rate. Out of the 30 items that you will see below,   3 items were missing and probably were the ones I wished had shipped I mean I   used sphere to pad the order I'd rather those not ship haha</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7z3gvTiP5Ic/X1MisBFBu7I/AAAAAAAA-EE/38K3TSm8ohgOh21d776JpWcNW9I3S0V2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/IMG_20200905_132101.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1269" data-original-width="2048" height="248" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7z3gvTiP5Ic/X1MisBFBu7I/AAAAAAAA-EE/38K3TSm8ohgOh21d776JpWcNW9I3S0V2QCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h248/IMG_20200905_132101.jpg" width="400" /></a>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Okay how did I squeeze all of them in one shot lol<br />(Also, there's         one real big head there haha; See below)       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>  In summary because I did not do up a table for this unlike last time (lol),   for a total of now <b>27 bromide photos</b> which consist of: 5 from Kaburagi Atsushi/Aki Yuki/Yuuki Aoi (yes only the last one is correct), 4 from Minako Kotobu/Kotobuki Minako, 2 from Natsukawa Pie/Natsukawa Shiina (lmao), 3 from Tachibana Rika, 3 from Satou Satomi, 2 from Fuchigami Mai, 1 each from Kido Ibuki, Tomomi Okubo/Ookubo Rumi and Numakura Manami (Aimi Numakura), and 5 from SPHIA/sphere to pad the order. Again, it's all for the purpose to bring up some of the people in my photo library so far. You know, playing catching up considering some are either just rare now or have no future plans to release more photos... yeah haha </div><div><br /><span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span></div><div>  <br />Yes, that was on purpose lol. So overall, because some items were   missing, instead of refunds they amended the   <b>final payment to be 7830yen</b>, from the 9170yen (~110 SGD if I'm not   wrong I forgot already) initial purchase from... I   <b>saved even more money</b> thanks to my sis' new debit card which charges   directly in yen based on the best exchange rate I can get from here. "For   testing purposes", by the way. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So man, by now it's already within 100   bucks so heck, remember the previous big package was 600, for 30+ photos?   Yeah, <i>I could've bought 5 more times from this shop</i> haha. Then again,   there are rarer stuff from that one compared to this, so whatever. You can't   buy Akarin and Ajuju (Waki Azumi) from this store just because so that's kinda   sad haha </div><div><br /></div><div>  UNBOXING TIME!!!

(That Aki-chan one was from an auction site, from some random guy who   lied lol) Other than that, if age is not a concern as I try to choose the   newer ones besides those to up the numbers (Aoi-chan, Fuchigami Mai,   Rika-sama), so most of them are in good condition. Again, I did actually get   my hands on 3 of them&nbsp; back then in April and I know o f their quality so   this isn't too far away by comparison- Hey it IS 30 items in the end after   all!! <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  In conclusion, I felt much lighter. Like, in burden. From the burden of money   spent on shipping, and from the burden of waiting for them to arrive. This   hype could not be more higher than this. Well, if I did not do this for the...   5th time this year? 6th, I should include those from my birthday haha. So   yeah, but I really promise for used items this shall be the last. At least for   the year. But probably as I mentioned, I would just buy the latest from now   since they are easier to obtain and also more hype because you can actually   get Akarin bromides now haha, but yeah, I love burning money. Not paper money   though I'm not actually involved in Lunar 7th Month from where I live   apparently. (lol) Cya guys next time then, and until then... excuse me while I   scan all this into my PC again haha why do I love to torture myself last year   it's photobook interviews now this </div><div><br /></div><div>  TL:DR; I was so bored on Saturdays I know this one will arrive EXACTLY on the   time where I can't think of anything to do over the weekend haha thanks past   me ugh </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. I need to find alternatives for forwarding services haha this is   mind-blowing of a reminder on how much money I could have saved </div><hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
