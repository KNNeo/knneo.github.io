<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #1</h2>
<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bpmAHItd_k8/XhHUOxlUGzI/AAAAAAAA3sY/Dl6zKARCsW8cE6RDaV0MLuvUUZAILJJKQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon08_wife.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>New year, new- I did that already just go see Anzai Chika's photobook haha<br /><br />Let's get this done quickly since there isn't much and I still need time to transition back to work after about like, a week and a half of work leave. New department too, so hopefully I can still have an easy time and not only have half an hour lunch breaks and not leave until the sun sets. Yeah, that's how bad that group is doing. Wish me the best, whoever is reading this which is probably just myself haha<br /><br />We better finish this quick I am doing the runs recently and I don't want it to disrupt my writing of this post lol ugh<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"What is justice?" Actually, thinking back, don't you think justice is "helping the majority do what is right"? Think about it.</div></blockquote>I mean, what is life now that they got rid of the best girl in the show? (Audience: What about Magase Ai?) MAGASE!!!!! Haha okay we're done with her for now. In this new episode (8) after the break, the family goes to the zoo. Okay, this sounds like such a great farce, but yeah let's get the happy things out of the way, Seizaki's family. *laughs* So yeah, apart from the happy stuff, we now progress from that pivot point that is <strike>the murder of Sekuro Hiasa</strike> <strike>the sadness of Seizaki</strike> the victory of Itsuki and the suicide law, because seriously, we haven't gotten over a lot of the other stuff from the past yet. Which is what Seizaki is in now, getting hallucinations about his dead buddies (Hiasa RIP) (well I guess not since they sent in the eye ugh) and whoever did all this by her own, that woman. Like Voldermort, I'm going to avoid mentioning her name since it literally is evil lol. Anyways, many things happened in Japan, so let's talk about those before going global. In Japan, Shiniki is... "prospering" with the new suicide law as it is going to be put in place, the drug that the pharmaceutical company was arrested for was probably pardoned and the euthanasia drug was released into market. Well, you can guess the rest. The Shiniki parliament is divided about the suicide law which still allows the mayor to be Itsuki so good on him, but bad for all of us. And of course considering this isn't a single country thing, the world knew about the group suicide and this new age city which just implemented a suicide law. From France to Canada, many cities are slowly implementing what could be detrimental to society. Again, life is not a video game where you can die and live again as something better or whatever. To be frank? If you die that's it. Don't bring religion into this, I tell you. Okay, let's talk about America. Suddenly we get a flashback about Alexander, some white dude who thinks all the time on anything and everything it seems, got lucky in a video game to be picked up by the love of his life (I also want haha the wife is HOT lol), has a son who can think on his own about the suicide law thank God, and... so much for the build-up of story because spoiler alert, he is the President of the United States. Yeah, since the Japanese can't deal with it, let's see if America can do something about it. What is this, BANANA FISH? *laughs* Ignoring similarities with other Anime series, let's actually talk about why FBI would be concerned about this. The agents in the car were right though, that if you're smart enough you'll think of dying. Just like how civilisation has worked over thousands of years ago, at the start you are just struggling to live, so dying isn't even a consideration as it is the easiest option. Then comes innovation and creativity, where your needs are met and can fulfill desire or even accomplish things in life as life expectancy increases. Eventually it'll come to a state that you will think of something else entirely different since society has done everything, but I'm not saying that the US President will think of dying lol (Seizaki is more desperate to commit suicide anyways), but he <i>is</i> thinking about it. We are of course, at this stage, only barely introduced to the involvement of other countries (mainly America) in assistance to Japan's sudden change in governance and... helplessness in preventing such a event from happening. Nomaru probably is so sad he can cry in a corner, Seizaki's superior is quitting seeing how Shiniki has actually "improved" in suicidal rates over this law, and Seizaki... let's just say he gave all the information to the FBI. We shall ignore his condition in exchange because it'll be a pivot point in the end of this series anyways. All in all, just a heads up to what will happen in the next few episodes as we conclude this series. Again, not expecting a happy ending whichever this goes (again, the family isn't even killed or whatever whatever enticed into suicide yet, Seizaki's), but may the previous episode be this series' ugliest. Please. You cannot one-up Kara no Kyoukai. Don't do it. *laughs* Cya guys next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bpmAHItd_k8/XhHUOxlUGzI/AAAAAAAA3sY/Dl6zKARCsW8cE6RDaV0MLuvUUZAILJJKQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon08_wife.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">In view of the impending sadness whichever direction it goes let's have some cute wife images haha<br />(The First Lady of USA may be hot but Seizaki you're wife is my type lmao okay don't hit me)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J2CiMA8WhA8/XhHUQEVBDVI/AAAAAAAA3sc/zU3Z79PqNt4-n2yJGryNVrejwqD-qvtDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon08_alex2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I don't think like this, but maybe I should start thinking like this dude lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "But I still believe that most problems in life can be solved if you keep thinking about them" That's LITERALLY my work life which is why I have all the unnecessary stress, and it'll NEVER work on <strike>Magase</strike>&nbsp;that woman, I guarantee you haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>We're starting off slow this year in Klassic Note 2020, as I apologise for not posting much in the new year. But I'm sure you saw the Song Awards Results already, so please tell me if you liked that Top 20 audio preview done using my HTML5 knowledge hehe. Anyways, this weekend I started reviewing some releases which I missed last year, and this is not an exhaustive list since I have more which we will talk about next week or next pargraph probably. <b>Sakamoto Maaya's new album</b> sounds alright thanks to the one trailer I heard on YouTube, and of course thanks to her releasing her music library on streaming (ie. Apple Music Japan for me) I get to hear the whole album. And it's okay, I think I can give a couple of songs. Not Tainaka Sachi, but I still kind of enjoyed listening to it. I just can't remember what song that one of those reminded me of; you go listen to the first song in the trailer and tell me what it feels like. Sorry for <b>miwa's new single</b> which was released last week but I gave Ikimonogakari instead and closed it, but hey I'm back in the new year for her. Eh... not that I would be giving anything on her new double A-side single since her "reboot" (her previous single was better), but... I may try giving one. Again, and if I don't, I'm sure it'll come back to <strike>haunt</strike> make me give them in the future haha<br /><br />Next week, and it is rather sudden because I just saw it yesterday, we getting <b>Polkadot Stingray's new mini-album</b> a listen but MAN are they fast. They got too many songs to write or what? lol anyways the music videos don't sound bad and they have quite a reputation here in Klassic Note already (congrats on 6th place in Top 20) so yeah I'll give a listen. Among the many releases from last year I have intentions of listening to so I might as well list them here in bulk: Goose house changed itself to <b>Play house and it's 1st album</b> is dedicated to answering all the "questions" in previous albums somehow, <b>a flood of circle has a new single</b> which I haven't given a listen since year end restrictions, and I'm going into the English world and <b>giving Dido a listen</b> because I gave one song from her like 5 years ago. It's going to be a slow year since things have been moving fast here in Klassic Note, so I hope you will give me some time to transition into the new year of new songs to give.<br /><br />On Twitter and news around the Internet explicitly ignoring voice actress marriages (F*** haha Rurukyan I wish you all the best with your 7 years younger husband lol), <b>Uesaka Sumire's new music video</b> is your new religious chant if you're into those, <b>Kitou Akari's new music video preview</b> isn't bad and since I'm giving Hanako-kun that Anime a chance I'll see if this goes in too, and <b>Q-MHz released the theme songs compilation for the above Anime "Babylon"</b> which I was just talking about just now. I mean, the last one I don't care since I already gave two I can ignore the other songs I already gave this series haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This shall be it again, I'm going to meditate until tomorrow morning lol. Also in Klassic Note Twitter you should've noticed my increasing usage of Japanese to... you know, talk about music, and again this is not to gain any popularity, but I'd like to talk about it to practice anyways. This year ahead's fortunes seem bad for me though, so I will not hold my breath. But I'll see how long I can hold my breath until I can't stand the new work environment that I may have to start writing a resignation latter lol. Maybe I should ask to have lunch again with the old guys they just across the room anyways haha okay bye<br /><br />P.S. Update on that Harvest Moon Mineral Town remake: Erii-chan is cute, sorry Mari-chan for not liking books, and farming on that ground which is smaller than Stardew Valley is still harder than Stardew Valley somehow. Probably because I'm playing it blind for now, so we shall see. Didn't know you had to learn how to make butter just from cooking- Do people learn how to do that just from cooking? lol<br /><div id="hiddenTags" style="font-size: 0em;">Babylon,SakamotoMaaya,miwa,PlayHouse,afloodofcircle,Dido,UesakaSumire,KitouAkari,QMHz</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
