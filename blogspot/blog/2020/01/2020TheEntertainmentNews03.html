<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #3</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7jb_ir1Suo/XiPb1M51MBI/AAAAAAAA38c/xDYvQYzTHFUj0P66lUqiALyNlCsNgizRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_aoi.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>I know it's a bit sudden, but this year's theme for watching Anime shall be "openness".<br /><br />Haha I know I literally based this on the number of shows I picked up this time around and I haven't even confirmed half of them to be able to say this but, hey, if it happens you'll see them around next week, I assure you. Oh yeah, next week... it's a public holiday here so I can't spend my weekend watching Anime now so... I may watch these earlier maybe. I just hope I don't have half a dozen shows to watch since Sunday is basically Anime day now lol<br /><br />Well maybe I'll just end up with 3 shows this season I don't know does this count as openness? Haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Okay, quick one. I'm not giving it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Easily for a number of reasons: (1) The guy is doing the tsukkomi role for EVERYTHING based on just even one guy so that's going to be tiring for even me seeing there's a diverse cast, (2) the guys around the main guy are (probably) literally Baka/Yamamoto from Anime "Jyoshimuda" who I can't even stand one of them in the intro already, (3) the opening theme sucks lol especially with the colourful characters and (4) I'm already watching 4 new shows this season. So, no. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></div></blockquote>TL:DR; Even a kid will get tired of asking questions just by looking at five minutes of this show imo<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Babylon</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I asked a friend I trusted to take care of (my family)" If it means I'm punished for killing the devil, I'll do it... is probably what Seizaki will say</div></blockquote>Again, I think I said this before, all this spreading of allowing suicide law probably spawned from one woman, and Itsuki probably is also done for by the woman in the first place. So yeah, just one evil, it seems. But we don't know, maybe it was from Itsuki. In this new episode (#Babylon10) where I hope things are heating up further, we come to a proper conclusion of the thinking process of the suicide law from the world leader's prospective. Of course, I'm talking about the America President Alex as I will now refer to him from here on. So, story. Seizaki and his buddy went back to ask the Mayor of Hartford about his visit to the old folks' home (sorry I'm used to this term) and... some girl commited suicide. Oh well, that Mayor told the kid that AFTER he received that one call, so... RIP kid you will be missed haha AGAIN the latest female in the series just came and went real quick I think this show is feminist. Moving on (haha), Alex consulted a priest about what it means in Christianity to commit suicide. I don't know much about this considering I've only heard someone tell me about it during my university time for about 10 minutes I think, commiting suicide is not a sin. And as the final words of the priest (he is not dead yet, I meant the cutscene), God loves mankind. Which is why obviously, knowing the freedom that the world has even thousands of years ago even pertaining to a fundamental thing of life such as death, The Lord did not state that as a sin. So yeah, you can die? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And that's why I'm a free thinker. But then again I can think of dying too and am probably more susceptible to Magase Ai's... incitement to kill, so... haha. Anyways, Alex then moved on to talk about this with two other people who will influence his decisions about this suicide law thing as a leader. First, his wife. The wife wanted him to not think too much, since time is of essence (she isn't wrong) and you aren't typically given all the facts before making the best decision, which is why intinuition becomes your next important thing. Hey, not telling you guys to just think of death and go die haha, but she is not exactly wrong. I just hope that his intinuition is not go to commit suicide lol. He then talked to Seizaki mainly on two things: why he wanted to be in the FBI and giving all the information as we have seen him in the US so far, and why he wants Magase, uh, I mean, the devil, eliminated. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (We can't say that she's like that Harry Potter villian that needs a nickname) Firstly, Seizaki revealed to Alex his actual intentions of being in the FBI: to kill Magase. (oops) No surprise there, I mean, we should've known. So he's here to get a gun to kill whenever, basically. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, goes to show how hard it is to do this at any occasion. Well, it's world affairs now so whatever. Then, he talks about his story to the President. I would argue that now that he has revealed his intentions to Alex himself (his chest hurts a bit man, he felt that) about how he practically lost everyone around him (at work) because of this dumb woman, that he is here to take revenge. Again, not really directly related to the law but considering that if the law is enacted and you start losing your life and people around you and this snowballs, we will see many more people dying for no reason. So yeah, that's bad, I guess. Oh also, at least we know now that the family is in good hands considering Magase doesn't have much time to influence that one guy who is protecting the family to kill the family or whatsoever so, good on you, bro. Alex then gave him what he asked for: a gun by being in the FBI officially so he can <strike>kill that bitc</strike> do what's right haha, and a command to always listen to his orders. The latter one, will probably come in use as a way to stop him from something in case he needs to. Hey, if it's to stop Seizaki from killing himself it's always  welcome. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, we've got enough people dying already another one just died this week, okay? Then, it's the Summit? Okay, the Prez be tuning in to Itsuki's speech on live television now too? So now Itsuki is bullsh*tting about how the suicide law cities can work together?? WTF isn't this a solo thing in the first place? This is no longer about society well-being already, this is politics. When's the last time you hear of a new law that everyone will gather in like, not inside the United Nations to talk about? So yeah, Itsuki's trying a revolution here, it seems. And at the end of thinking for at least two weeks day and night, I think Alex has an answer. He thought that he doesn't have to be the one who is thinking about the <u>morality</u> of the suicide law. (Take note of the word I just used) Because, just like Itsuki, he just needs to act like a leader. And considering he's the world leader (ignoring China and North Korea lol) he can make the world not fall into this trap. I mean, it'll take as many occasions of Magase's influence to get enough people to kill themselves, but it only takes him to stop all of that. (And Seizaki with a gun too probably haha) That... might be the focus of next week as he calls for his world summit to work against the one put forth by Itsuki, I guess. We shall see. This is getting to a point beyond human comprehension, people. I'm not going to tell you what I feel about this show now, but I can tell you something that Seizaki is right about as he always is: I want to see that evil woman put down. And I guarantee you we will see it happen. And if she doesn't die I'll go in and take an Anime gun and do it like those isekai shows haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_jHe8F8JR3M/XiPE4cwvEVI/AAAAAAAA37k/fyaDpEGv_dccdvsVULfNeRyLbiEMM-eIQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon10_girl2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Here's a question in a thumbnail:<br />What you do think is the right age to allow the suicide law to be applicable?<br />Because if not I'm pretty sure I'll be dead younger than this girl lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FmYiA1Z7BNY/XiPE4alZ5_I/AAAAAAAA37g/WwKBCZ8UqIMrmDh9zeWo6stJzbEbJm-xQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/babylon10_wife.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Gotta love that wife, you lucky bastard haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I'm not a burglar! I'm a Master Thief" Okay  12-year-old don't let me call the police on you haha</div></blockquote>Nah, he's not gonna hold that secret I mean look at Makoto's face he can't even keep a secret lmao. In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion02) I learn that <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">TSUNDERE</a> HATENA-CHAN <a href="https://jisho.org/search/saikou" target="_blank">SAIKOU</a>!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No seriously, this might become the only reason why I'll continue to watch this series haha. So, story time, because we got lots more to talk about on... everything, it seems. Hey, Makoto not being a female is already good enough content for one episode so they gotta push the side characters to this week, yes? Haha so, we are introduced to more characters of this wonderful series but first, a story about Artifacts. Since this is still by far the most interesting part of this show, we can learn a little more about it as described by Hatena-chan. Artifacts are magical objects with a will, it seems, that were (probably ancestors but also) made by the mother. Problem is then, a good amount of them were stolen. (Why make so many in the first place?? lol) (Then again Kokomi could also do this too lol later on that) Stolen probably to be used for bad purposes, since now a good amount of people know of these and could be using this for evil, or even for own benefit like auctioning this stuff. Hey, if it's magical then it has great value even if you don't know how to use it. So once in a while the current Master Thief i.e. the mother, has to go "steal" back what was theirs to begin with, which is effectively just replacing it with an object that looks the same so the normal humans won't see the difference anyway. And that's why they call the mother the Master Thief. Of Artifacts. Haha not like we're going to make a justice Robin Hood series out of this lol it's just taking back what's been stolen. And Hatena-chan is in line to succeed in her mother's duty. She sucks, haha, but still, she is in training. Then, they go to school, and here is where the new slew of character introductions start. Cue Kikyouin Kokomi, <strike>Hatena-chan</strike> Kana-chan's childhood friend and classmate who, amongst all things, keep talking about that other name in which as of now should be kept secret. What a d*ck friend, amirite?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> There is more reason to this which we will talk about later, and Makoto somehow got a few new friends at school like those guys (the biggest dude is real suspicious imo who asked you to join the little boy gang lol) and probably picked up a few chicks in school by showing off his magic wand (which is surprisingly not his penis lmao OKAY) and probably defending Hatena in the process (considering Ema-san is student council level busy). You know, because that silly girl keeps showing off the magic stuff and probably is the one who gets the Artifacts stolen from the mansion in the first place. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> So that's why. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> ANYWAYS, back in the mansion, Makoto gets to take a break from school instead of doing butler duties because there isn't anything to do at the time (that or the old geezer is real good at it) so he gets to talk to Yumemi. Man, Yumemi-chan's room is the best haha IS THAT A PX4?? Haha and in case you didn't notice her room is filled with Artifacts which will probably protect her when needed. Problem number 2 comes in during dinner where Kokomi suddenly shows up at her childhood friend's house to... well, besides finding out that Hatena is hiding a man at her place (thank goodness it's not her room lmao) (also, sweet female butler you got there), Kokomi is also here to search for an Artifact. Yeah, just any one, she doesn't care. Unlike the Master Thief of her successor, this one... doesn't know about magic. So... it'll be practically impossible to get one under her command anyways but man did the father promise something stupid and think it'll not come back to bite on him. Oh well, the servants will clean up after this so... haha *sigh* Kokomi, and her family, turns out, is also part of a conglomerate (wow I spelt that correctly first try I thought autocorrect was broken lol) which will somehow take care of all administrative matters in this series, I'm sure. So she knows everything. And after a good day's digging of someone else's place without saying sorry, the girl leaves for the night. (I don't like the butler's grin at the end, and she can fight too so) All in all, wonderful development for a series that I might continue watching, to be honest. I mean, I'm already in for the theme songs so this will do quite nicely for the season haha wtf is with that ending lol<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JaZT8USFFbs/XiPQTXvlmuI/AAAAAAAA370/kMmu13Fzyp0FozqQZYSvE3AKvnlMqgpLgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion02_girls.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How you know you have successfully picked up chicks with your magic skills haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nEMMDag1k_o/XiPQVaiySJI/AAAAAAAA374/Wsb8_eHQzJUzJKdmbZ3S0ftVw8TqMMFdwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion02_kokomi2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Nowhere close to porno, by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Anyways, story because we have quite a lot to talk about. Firstly, the youkai in question this week as hinted last week. Well, there isn't much of a hint besides the radio thing at the end and considering I still get much from it... oh well haha. (Okay I went back to see it again and it still isn't much of a hint) So, it's about losing stuff. I mean, from Yashiro losing her textbook to missing locker doors, man is this getting from bad to worse real quick. We would expect Hanako-kun to take care of this but, uh, he's more concerned about keeping that one girls' toilet clean lol does he have OCD?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> For Yashiro, she rather spend her time helping other (male) senpai out with paperwork though haha. I get you, girl, but both of you two are hopeless lmao. Okay, Yashiro has more friends than the one apparition so... lol. Too bad for Yashiro, it's her job now for being saved (technically) twice in an episode, so she kinda has to do this now after school every day. Man, there's even surveillance for keeping up with this thing btw (which is also probably  exposing her to danger tbh Hanako-kun you piece of sh-) and talking about that, some youkai noticed that, for sure. Turns out, it's some youkai who keeps devouring on stuff which made people think their stuff got "lost" so Hanako did end up taking care of it. Turns out, they are innocent little creatures who like to play prank on humans from time to time. But things can be different in this case, and instead of letting the rumours spread negatively, Yashiro as a human can help change the rumours to give these little beings (it's a plushie too btw go look it up) a chance of being viewed positively because that's their purpose in their youkai life, and to stop the weird stuff from happening where only the one girl can explain haha. So, the rumour now includes a reversal, where if you give them candy they will not pester you. Sounds like a great trade-off, so there's that. Secondly, we have a rival. Well, not as in love rival because Yashiro doesn't have any (BOOM GOT HER haha), but we have someone to come exorcise the one guy in the girls' toilet. I wouldn't call that exorcise since besides being an offence to be present in a girls' toilet as a male (lol), he is technically evil. But as Yashiro said, we don't know anything about this ghost. So, cue Minamoto Kou (if you need a reminder he was confessed to multiple times by girls but not Yashiro, and got bumped by her probably down the stairs and given terrible gifts like twice all in one episode lmao) who apparently is under a line of exorcists (nope this is not "Ao no Exorcist" I don't watch that weeb shit lol) and is tasked (by himself) apparently to get rid of Hanako. I mean, the friendship is nice and all between the two just earlier, but then Hanako had to fight back. And he won. Well, to a newbie in this, but still. He was a killer, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, considering this youkai has a knife for a weapon, this shouldn't be too surprising. And in what seems to be the most amount of action (as in time, and as in intensity) we have seen thus far, this is probably that side dish I'll end up remembering for this series, to say the least. Of course, we will end up having to answer the question where this ex-killer will be able to <a href="http://approachinese.com/dict/zh2en/%E9%87%91%E7%9B%86%E6%B4%97%E6%89%8B/" target="_blank">clean his hands upon the gold pan</a> (sorry if this is a Chinese proverb) and not start splashing blood everywhere because we've got a new rumour in the house!! Hey, if that fourth step on the stairs brings me to the "Spirited Away" world to be a servant it might be worse than cleaning the toilet for some youkai haha cya next week<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P7jb_ir1Suo/XiPb1M51MBI/AAAAAAAA38c/xDYvQYzTHFUj0P66lUqiALyNlCsNgizRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_aoi.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Cute youkai may be cute but cute classmate is better hehe kawaii</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n4YyyD08nAM/XiPb1mHk3XI/AAAAAAAA38g/PxIRrtdpk-MJXDPPF2dqyJqK6hUkdHVKACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun02_gay.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so gay I can't even</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#RikeKoi04) of a series where it's focused on nothing but experiments instead of lovey-dovey stuff although there is, this series is going to be literally "Kaguya-sama" episode 1 but it's every episode haha. Goddamn though if there is any Anime that can science up romance this much it's only this show, I guarantee you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Let's <strike>talk about</strike> analyse this episode. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But seriously, this series is just making me laugh like an idiot while making me dumb, and I like it. So this episode, the duo go dating. And if you expected it to be an experiment, you're not alone haha. And so far... I mean, it's only getting better tbh. And thank goodness there's two other observers in with this experiment, or else the two might already be wrong from the start. Hey, this Anime is not whatever tsukkomi Anime I rejected earlier so thanks Kanade-chan for telling them to get clothing haha. And as expected, they had to plan on how to do this experiment, from how to come up with proper hypotheses to how to track data and so on. Again, if you don't mind any of these this show is still watchable. Why? Because of the many romantic scenes here and they have to let the two tap on their counter app on the times they felt something haha. But seriously, it might be too much. The Anime sure knows how to reduce that as much as possible in order not to lose audience like me though, as the bear literally gave up to explain too much so to not bore the rest of us. (Just Google "statistics normalisation" if you need to understand that) But otherwise, Himuro is lovely af, Yukimura is going along with his intuition a lot more in this date (after arguing with the one guy who is trying to chat up his girl) than his own deductions which is great. Also, the recording of data from the other two is the best haha. There is technically also flexibility in this experient (lol), where Yukimura gave up in holding hands with his girl so to make Himuro feel so sad we can only tell with the data that she is instead of looking at her face. Hey, who says feelings in a date cannot be seen? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on and ignoring that loser who got slapped by going out with some other girl lol (okay he did got analysed by two people on picking a girl up, so...), we move on to the next part of the date, which is the theme park. Hey, so stereotypical, you just need to watch enough Anime to know this is the place to go on dates. But heck, all along the way the couple is only talking about physics and scientific theories, from roller coaster centripetal force to historical paranormal discoveries- Okay I'm tired haha I don't get grades for explaining these here anyways. (Science student here, by the way) All in all, besides the science stuff that can make the show real dry after getting us wet (I mean, look at Himuro and hear her scream on the rides haha), there are certain scenes which I said, Yukimura did take some initiative to make it look like a date than follow the experiment plan. For example, the present. I know it's still based heavily on scientific analysis (yeah Yukimura why not analyse her vag-), but they are afraid of heights while sitting on a Ferris Wheel haha, and the experiment was a success. Hey, at least we know Himuro was enjoying it lmao. Okay, and here's my ultimatum right here: Not going to do hypotheses, but if they can keep up this pace of having something to talk about (scientifically and romantically) every week I'll watch it. We shall see what they can cook up i.e. experiment plan for next week. But then again, right now I'm 65.2% sure I'll watch this series till the end haha you thought you won't get stats from me?? Hey, blame this show haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PRYzR1BAgKo/XiP2WwV-JXI/AAAAAAAA39A/ALISSMZzub4sxkFxRSz7Qk9hHkm-RFKCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi02_kanade2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">We can don't watch that tsukkomi Anime I rejected liao because she's one and she's cuter hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4DOH9ry5bYQ/XiP2W_jmXqI/AAAAAAAA388/VfG30D3n_-Mmf-cQW6eNP_zSW0PLlZRYACEwYBhgL/s320/rikekoi02_himuro1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oh hello sexy Ten-chan haha the voice don't matter anymore</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri02) of this other youkai series, I've never seen a serpent want a beautiful woman's body that bad lmao. Okay images of snakes eating up humans whole are surfacing already so let's talk about this quick haha. Hmm... if you are still okay with mystery talks every episode to a bunch of youkai who won't give up on explanations like your mom then... hey, I'm liking it because it's rather peaceful tbh. So, the story of the week is a serpent. Kotoko was summoned to the river a town away because the "Water God" living there has something to clarify on. Hey, it be more persistent than the best detectives out there, and this will take a lot of explanation it seems, but she seems bent on going anyways. She's been given the title of God of Wisdom, after all. If Kotoko wants a backup plan by calling on Kuro-san who literally saved her last episode, it's no wonder it sucks when he rejected the offer. Also, having regeneration skills like Kuro would be real useful in many occasions if he didn't also take in another corpse other than a mermaid to cancel his immortality. Man, this show is complicated haha. So yeah, that's how it is for now, so we'll leave what that other one is that he ate for next time. Meanwhile, Kotoko has to go up to the mountains alone... after visiting Kuro-san again in the evening in hopes he would join, and man is he really cooking up soup for dinner lol. Kuro gets her ready for the mountain trip haha, and off she went. Alone, of course, and he snatched a youkai as a promise for coming back alive, I guess. It was quite a long debate going on so I won't bore you with the story if you aren't as interested, but a murder case likely tied to a third person with someone covering it up... so far won't explain why that one woman who admitted she was the killer threw the corpse into the river the God drinks water from. Hey, she couldn't find anywhere else, can? It was the nearest place she could go at night why you have to rat it out on her?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I'm pretty sure if I said that I'll be removed of my duties by being eaten immediately haha. So... I don't know man. You guys enjoyed it? The jokes in between somehow got me going though, but to be honest I may get real bored if it's always like this every week. But I'll try. I saw the original work a little and there are several arcs with the first major one coming out soon so we shall see. For next episode... I swear if Kotoko says "I don't know" we're going to make Kuro-san the sacrifice liao haha bye<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hIxcV_bs1Hs/XiQFR7JBC9I/AAAAAAAA39g/fnFbP9KijO4SJkmF7QpO52fI5UqOiEyCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri02_youkai3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">You wished beach cleaning was this efficient haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-locgR9W6pGs/XiQFThz-k8I/AAAAAAAA39k/eOIdirXm4LoH9XIBfCOiN7etmInvMriDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri02_youkai1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I see, this is a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sukebe" target="_blank">sukebe</a> youkai haha pls let me be it</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Let's start with this week's stuff. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> was real close to getting on the shelf mainly because of the B-side I would say, but then again the full theme song isn't great either, so I shall not further comment. <b>Yuuki Aoi's new single</b> is thrown off my shelf now that I listen to it, since I will probably never get used to her style and voice as of now. I really missed her when she was in Victor, to be honest. A cute her is better than cool her imo. Now, for past releases. <b>Play.Goose's first album</b> (yep, the guys who were in Goose house) was... said to be the answers to the previous songs, and... not that I cared about that in the lyrics because I don't, but I could pick up a song or two just to remember, so sure I'll continue to listen to them maybe. <b>Dido's latest album</b> as I have given her one song years ago is... different than her usual style, but that doesn't mean I can't give her a song or two. I'll give myself another week to sink in on this. <b>Cider Girl's new album</b> which released last week apparently wasn't too bad, but it's definitely not great enough for me to talk about it enthusiastically (man what is with songs today), nonetheless though I will give chance. Last but not least, <b>Anime "Kyokou Suiri" opening theme song single</b> which released even before the Anime previewed it this week, released last week and... it's a band alright. It's... just not the ones I'll be liking. They are J-Rock too so that's rather bad on their reputation haha. Which will be complimented by the fact that I may end up dropping the Anime after all, so don't feel about it, yes? I show no emotion to songs that suck-<br /><br />I can imagine what it feels like when vivid undress writes their first Anime theme song- Please don't be like them haha<br /><br />Next week brings us a slew of releases which I don't know if I'll like but we'll see. These range from <b>Tachibana Rika's first album</b> after she started a couple of years ago and I've literally given her nothing besides the recent song which I probably will start doing AFTER she got married (lol no relation btw), <b>Uesaka Sumire's new album</b> literally based on the one single which rocked the world last year so I'm not anticipating much hearing whatever that topic song is about (it's her quirk and I don't like it), and <b>Base Ball Bear's new album</b> since their band turned three-piece last year and I started giving them more songs, so this might be the most anticipating one. And considering it's holiday season next weekend I'll have plenty of time to decide all of the above sure enough. Music subscriptions are making this real easy to do so, by the way so FUCK YOU SPOTIFY-<br /><br />I would love to write a post about how well Spotify and its ad-driven service compares to the Apple Music Japan subscription I pay for now but that'll have to wait until I have the time to type a lot- Oh yeah my subscription I have to renew haha<br /><br />Talking about new news across the Internet, of course, about music for Klassic Note, I'm probably not going to get hyped about <b>TrySail's new single</b> considering their previews didn't hook me in at all, <b>fumika surprised us with a new single</b> with her which I've not heard yet haha, <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song</b> for a.. college festival project is written by yuiko-san in which I cannot express how great she sounds singing solo, and <b>Anime "Kaguya-sama" is airing next season</b>. Welp Attack on Titan Season 4 because you will be forgotten haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This shall be it then. I also clicked the order button on my last photobook for the year which starts on my birthday and this 10th book will probably appear next month which is... Kitou Akari's 1st photobook. Because she's getting popular. I'll save the talk on the actual post itself, but suffice it to say I had to wait for the pre-order sign event ticket chance to expire on Monday? Yeah, before I could order because I probably won't go even if I get it and I don't really want to rob others the chance of winning one which will probably not be of my concern lol. Hey, good guy me, but not like Akarin will know. But we are getting good side dishes along with the book (talking about special gifts lol), so I'll look forward to that. Cya guys next week, and until next time... I want to finish that Harvest Moon Mineral Town game before the new Animal Crossing game comes out. I just need to marry someone haha hardest decisions in games amirite?? <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Haha bye<br /><br />P.S. Windows 10 has been doing me well so far I just don't know why my mouse scrolling has been bad ever since I changed OS the keyboard was after that and I still have the problem<br /><br />P.P.S. Not going to make a post about it, but this year's calendar is... sphere. It's probably bad enough to compare to the table fold-around calendar from Mikakoshi since it's all live footage images so I'm not showing you guys what's inside.
