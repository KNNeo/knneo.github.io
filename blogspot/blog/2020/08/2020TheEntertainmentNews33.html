Just feeling tired nowadays maybe doing the same thing day and night at work somehow. Well, I'm going to get my monthly happy package in a couple of weeks so that's good. *laughs* Also, set up such that my dad can get his phone changed within the next couple of days, sadly, on weekdays. Too bad, but he stays at home now anyways, and his phone is acting cranky on calls already, so I decided to do it now, like, half a year since I suggested it. Well, my sis don't give two shits so I'm doing it for my dad. Happy Father's Day haha okay try using my level of filial piety to kill me you can't</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's talk about Anime, shall we? I didn't take any work leave tomorrow so my weekend is ending so let's be done with it haha</div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="GREATPRETENDER06"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> GREAT PRETENDER</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"If you don't want your mom in heaven to worry..." Uh oh RIP Makoto's mom it wasn't his fault he's still doing well in jail lol</div></blockquote>"Team Confidence" lol how is this reminding me of "Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei" where you can't get rid of that friend who pops up in your university life whichever path you choose haha. Yeah, just in this case the main guy is Makoto and the friend is Laurent. So, more plot development before we move in to the next big deal, I guess. In this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER06) after Makoto got a lot of cash helping Laurent out to defeat Cassano, he decided to... do jail time. Wait, what? Yes, and he did it, for how long we don't know. Laurent, after years of enjoying the fortune from Cassano, seems to be eyeing for something else once again. Let's start from the top. Firstly, about Chris. I know, I'm like "who is this?" because I have no idea who it is anyways (maybe one of the guys since the last heist), but we start with the lady getting fired by her manager. For pure bias reasons. Over here at this blog we try to promote worker performance based on merit and not on anything else, so yeah, this is kind of dated maybe. But yeah, there are such employers out there. To cut cost or whatever, and she still has a kid to feed. So bad luck, girl, or so we think. Cue Cynthia, yes, I mean, it's not obvious enough? *laughs* But her disguised of course, to talk to the manager into duping his whole fortune basically, on underground betting. Well firstly because (1) everything is rigged, yes EVERYTHING, and I guess (2) Cynthia still runs the place so she decided to help out the poor woman? Spoiler alert: all the manager's fortune goes to Chris, by the way, via mysterious package of course. So, the plot in a nutshell, is just they were betting in a bar, the manager gets excited, they have sex- Haha okay wrong story the man wishes this will happen lol. They talk over the bar, Cynthia suggests a loophole in underground betting and thus cannot go down to the place with him to bet, but instructs him to earn some paper for her. He does so, they won, and of course the idiot is dumb enough to withdraw all of his cash to bet on that Abigail when we do remember that the place is run by them so Abbie just loses on purpose (but with a relapse of her desire for blood) (okay so that one testing of Sakura Magic is this too?) so his entire fortune is gone haha. Hey, easy bait, especially if it's only for the one guy, who promptly called the police on the place to arrest... nobody. Haha what an idiot the bank teller is real wise though lol. Then, we talk about Makoto's story after jail. He... picked up new skills, and of course, a new perspective. Of probably, not doing that "confidence man" business with Laurent, considering everything is under his scope, and he's always taken advantage of, plus he just wants to live an honest life, so he finds a job as a mechanic after he was released, continuing his skills he picked up behind bars. An old man took him in, and in a couple of months he's gotten good enough to fix planes. He gives him an offer to help out in an Air Race (if you haven't seen those before) (not even in video), and he accepts!! Yeah, we got him again, huh. *laughs* Says Laurent lol because suddenly Makoto is in Cynthia's island again. Not deja vu, by the way, he's just dumb haha. So yeah, again, all under Laurent's plan. So, last but not least, the plan. Laurent intends to participate a team in the Air Race hosted by some rich oil princes, and take the prize money (and maybe their fortunes too) while they are at it. Makoto somehow took the bait anyways without much resistance lol (he could've just left and this series would have ended haha), and they decide to start training in preparation for the race that is taking place... wait for it... in Singapore. Yes, thus the title of this arc. Sadly, they have a long way to go, as Makoto shows off his skills to Abbie only to be doubted and being sent on board with the pilot (yes Abbbie can fly a plane) (and fight too?) (wow she knows everything) only to find out that the engine died and they had to bail. I would like to believe Laurent and Cythia that his skills aren't great, but it didn't take too long for Laurent to reveal what he did to the plane before it started taking off. But we know Makoto's skills are probably good but they are in this case still mediocre haha the old man just gave him the confidence to do it get it "confidence man" haha okay I hate my jokes lmao. Anyways, as you can see, this is the first step into making them look like they have a team, and THEN rig every single plane out there in competition to make sure they win. Simple. What could go wrong? More sabotage? Or probably something we cannot expect? Remember, their network of connections is as far as it can take them I may already be set up to assist in their plan to get a cut because I live there lmao hey Laurent if you need some help I could use some dough lol let's see what happens next week<div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TAGvw1KMXZ0/XzkdsEC4CAI/AAAAAAAA9kM/T5n54mC-Lj49airwBnpb2zsJyj2aze5kgCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/greatpretender06_cynthia4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Can Cynthia be more cool than last week?

"...take a bath, and sleep..." And then he sleeps in it? Haha the power of language man. Well they didn't say Makoto is sleeping on a bed anyways lol (in Japanese "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hairu" target="_blank">haite</a>" means entering a bath, so it makes more sense for the joke compared to English subs)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="UzakiChan06"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It's so hot" I know right Ayachi you so hot- Uh, I mean... *laughs* I mean, that did happen, her in a bikini. Sort of. *laughs*</div></blockquote>I'm afraid I have to say this here now that all is laid bare, Sakurai and Uzaki are both in Anime level body proportions that will not be possible in the real world. Like, really, even Sakurai. *laughs* In this new episode (#UzakiChan06) where they still have to make the old guy in the cafe appear so he's the narrator of the intro lol, they go to the beach. Hey, obligatory beach episode, what else? You don't need explanations for that. But okay, they have one. So turns out, Uzaki is asking Sakurai out for summer vacation. And being the loner Sakurai is, he would rather spend all day <strike>playing games</strike> catching up on stuff he missed (lol) (I would argue that you cannot miss catching up on video games; Not until you start working haha) (Well, those guys from "WotaKoi" were handling it quite well though), than go to like, the beach, with this irritating friend of his. Not talking about Sakaki anyways haha, but hey, they had to go anyways. *laughs* So yeah, and besides being trashed in the changing room, Ami-chan is here too, so yeah, four people, in case you didn't know what happened to the old man in the cafe lol. Sakurai jumps into the ocean with his swimming goggles while leaving Uzaki-chan alone, so Ami gives him a lashing. Like yeah, no one can resist picking up on two jugs on the beach, amirite?? *silence* Anyways, yeah they kind of have to look after each other, but not Uzaki she isn't. Besides beating the crap out of Sakurai for praising her swimsuit (and probably how big those jugs were) (lol guess you figured out the meaning for jugs haha), she also teased the shit out of him while he was playing <a href="https://jisho.org/search/suikawari" target="_blank">suikawari</a>, giving him like, gamepad buttons instead of actual directions. Accident happened, and THANK GOODNESS for Kuso Cat, by the way, or else I would've stopped watching this since Episode 1 lol hey add in Ami-chan for that too hehe I'm half here for Ayachi tbh. Anyways, I'm not into ecchi scenes and neither should you (yes, you, 10-year-old), so we move on to the lodging that Sakaki has provided... and it's huge. You know, because there's gotta be someone rich in the series or else how we get the free accommodation? Oh, and it's gotta be big too, can't be small like what people normally rent out at a bargain haha. After a delightful dinner with ingredients prepared by Sakaki... he thought it'll be fun to go to the mountains for some courage testing. Yeah, bad idea bro, as of course, Sakurai is not bought by this idea, as timid as he might seem, to join in on this fiasco. Uh, just, don't look at Uzaki-chan now she's too excited to go crazy on knowing of her senpai's weakness lol. Again, I don't know if this is to get back at him or whatever ("THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TOUCHING MY BREA-" lol) but yeah, if people genuinely are scared (sorry Nan-chan but I didn't force you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLJ2tueYKsk" target="_blank">play horror video games for 2 hours last night</a>) (link is for first hour second is for premium members) (she needs to be protected, my dear imouto) (haha) I would normally not do those things to them. How to say? It sounds great to bring people to their brink of emotions, but then if it potentially can break them like what we see after Sakurai has been teased for a while by his kouhai... you wouldn't do that to anyone anymore, I promise. Anyways, Sakurai got freaked out so bad he got tired, and after everyone else went to bed and Uzaki still hyping about clearing a level in whatever game not noticing the people around her were sleeping already, she stopped and... you know, slept at the sofa because Sakurai said so- Okay that was a lie, but you get the point. *laughs* Yeah, you two <i>really </i>missed something the night before I'm sure haha Well, considering only Uzaki-chan knows about it (and us) (haha that makes two of us), I sure hope for Sakurai's sake... yeah go get that body pillow you'll need it lmao. Wonderful episode, accidents can be avoided as usual I could do with less... rated... stuff... haha, and next week we're going other places to play. Apparently the cafe is not enough to house the lot of them. Yeah, Uzaki is working there now too haha the fun brought to them lol great for them haha we shall see more shenanigans next week I suppose</div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MtvTPMp6Qv8/XzkeyovYR5I/AAAAAAAA9kg/bPnxF_YA6GcPzdteb3uqswEMe5zHttwXwCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/uzakichan06_cat1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's a rule to not show ecchi scenes here so here's some KUSO CAT lol<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c7afBCADgJI/XzkeyncNVsI/AAAAAAAA9kk/sTTn6923_i00R2qCie9He50TCqePsDehQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/uzakichan06_cat3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption">It's a rule to not show ecchi scenes here so here's some KUSO CAT lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

I know Mami-chan is your exception and mine's Ten-chan but. *lauhgs* Okay, I'm hype though, 'cos we get Ruka-chan this week! I got spoiled a bit on the plot, so let's talk about it now that I've seen it all. In this new episode (#KanoKari06) where Kazuya would be better sleeping at the corridor haha, no they just too it normal. Besides, we have an issue to solve. So firstly, about the two of them. Yes, Chizuru and Kazuya, of course. Kazuya really starts to get worried on two fronts, that the elders would not be able to take in the news anyways, and mainly also, because he wouldn't be able to get over the fact that he broke up with his ex here, and still trying to escape out of it promptly and actually after all this, try to get a real girlfriend. Chizuru understands this too, as matured as she is, so she gives Kazuya some more time. And yes, the solution to all this might be to really get a real one, so the elders can be appeased and Kazuya wouldn't feel so bad about himself. Also, about his wallet. *laughs* But yeah, he has thought about it, dating this rental girlfriend for real. Haha hey, she doesn't care for now so... maybe not? We shall see. Meanwhile, as Kibe-san is gloating over the two making up since the incident (lol dude you too good of a man to get a girlfriend normally these people are gay and ripped) (lmao), Kazuya's other friend comes into play. Yes, Kuri-san now has a girlfriend. Yeah. Wait, what? *laughs* Don't know how he got it which is already suspicious (I'm sorry because I really know it already) (why did they not show it this episode though), and it hasn't been long I wonder how long the guy has been keeping mum about it anyways, but yeah, ignoring that one first encounter between her panties and Kazuya's eyes (lol), enter Ruka-chan. Well, not really entering yet, as you have seen in trailers. But you know, someone wanted to show off like what Kazuya did, so they have to go on a double date. Hey, your friend reminding yourself of you a couple of episodes ago, bro? *laughs* If this is going any other ways I wouldn't even believe it but you know, we kind of know what happens. For the time being, as the four spend an afternoon in the rock climbing centre, they got to hang out with each other, mainly two pair of dude eyes dating two female bodies, if you get what I'm saying here lol these perverts haha. And that's why you get a normal girlfriend- Okay moving on! *laughs* A lot of things happened sideways too, so let's talk all about it. Ignoring Kuri wanting to show off his girl to someone else (I wonder if Kibe knows about this lol), Ruka-chan found out somehow that Chizuru is a rental girlfriend but did not mention any reason for it because I mean, if you have seen her on dating sites is probably the only reason you'll know about her, right? I mean, look at Chizuru's normal appearance not as a rental girlfriend haha. But let's assume she doesn't know that, or that she just has a good eye for what couples are really like and didn't believe a word from her guy saying how intimate they were and the Kazuya saving Chizuru and her in turn giving him CPR- They don't know about that. *laughs* But yeah, you get the idea. But really, do they have to be physical in order to prove their love for each other, just in general? I mean Ruka-chan, you kissed your guy yet? *laughs* Anyways, Chizuru did a fake kiss, Ruka wasn't convinced, Kuri was an idiot, and Kazuya was sweating even when he's not climbing the wall haha. But yeah, coming back, and assuming she DOES know that Chizuru is a fake not because they can't convince her they were really dating to the level that she can be convinced (hey not everyone can lie all the way like Laurent here haha yes a GREAT PRETENDER reference), but more of like if they are found out and she tells on... anybody they would be screwed. You see, that's what happens when you let the whole world know you have a fake girlfriend, Kazuya. *laughs* I think for Kuri-san too but that's a future problem hehe oops. But yeah, they got out of it quick, but Kazuya is now real worried that this might happen sooner or later. Of course, I see no incentive in ratting any of them out for real, for (1) I'm pretty sure in <a href="https://twitter.com/kanokari_anime/status/1293472294543687680?s=20" target="_blank">the web preview</a> someone mentioned that Ruka is a fake too *wink* (okay maybe not I was hearing it wrong haha oops) and more importantly (2) Kazuya immediately went to try to confront her alone so to tell her to not rat him out and this is where he took the bait haha F**KING GOT HIM lol. Man, I feel like Ruka-chan may have been way more experienced as a woman even if she is indeed someone who doesn't know of the rental girlfriend thing. Women instinct, that's what it's called. So yeah, now Kazuya really has to explain himself now that he has literally shown his tail about his whole dating thing so far. Hey, someone has to find out somehow. Let's see how he gets out of this one though lol I'm just glad Naobou (who voiced Ruka-chan of course) is finally in HELL YEAH haha cya guys next week (she looks really like the 2D equivalent though I mean <a href="https://twitter.com/mygirl_official/status/1291718508166799365?s=20" target="_blank">look at this</a>)</div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SC5UZ7WojOs/XzkcPp990UI/AAAAAAAA9j0/hblTMhTojWoNdEC7MRTLfdCihVIAqgT_ACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/kanokari06_ruka5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Because <strike>Naobou</strike> Ruka-chan is kawaii hehe<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YDOdS7WbIrg/XzkcQQbPxlI/AAAAAAAA9j4/NU9nc2RGCsMqtskMxm4JmYEj83Gqvfy2wCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h180/kanokari06_couple3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Really, if my dying wish is to do this with a certain someone, preferably Ten-chan haha<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

And since I thought I prepared for this and have work so I didn't prepare for like say, another Digital Singles Week (why must this remind me of me being single) but yeah, we got stuff for next week already so maybe next time then I just want a break but like, from work haha<br /><br />On news from Twitter and beyond that I may or may not care at this point, <b>miwa's new music video</b> for some drama is... real bold, but man do I not get the traditional Japan fusion thing or whatever dance so cya next time miwa-san haha, I hope you listened in to <b>VELTPUNCH's livestream</b> of them mostly talking about the album which I didn't pay attention much but of course the mini acoustic live which played every single song I know of so that's good (they are also doing another next month so yay), <b>SPYAIR is releasing a new single</b> due November since their last 2 years ago, <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new music video</b> (preview) is pretty cool but not as cool as the song itself I would argue, and <b>Amamiya Sora released new videos</b> we didn't ask for, like a recording video of her self-composed song which is due on her new album next month, to special behind the scenes footage of her doing music videos over the past 5 years as she steps into her 6th year in her solo music career. Yes, I did review a couple of her singles including her debut single too. I remember it as if it was yesterday lol Ten-chan we were so young back then haha&nbsp;<br /><br />So for next week, and don't mind me pasting the content from last week here lol, I'll be listening to <b>vivid undress' new mini-album</b> "since they went major last year December. The latter though... I didn't give the topic song though so first impressions aren't great so we shall see for the rest of the release then dear guys don't disappoint me." *laughs* No really, my perspective hasn't changed yet maybe it will next week. "Oh, and <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new single</b> if I have the time" okay me stop copying yourself lmao but seriously we'll talk about them next week this time I'm sure I confirmed it on their Twitter again haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Man, I can't help but thank Natsukawa "My Imout" Shiina on her special gameplay livestream yesterday playing horror games and freaking herself out for 2 hours (second hour is for premium members only, niconico premium) so effectively for an hour I hear her scream and squeal which is normally not seen on her gameplay videos, difference being no live cam. They got her an emergency cat/dog button so she can relax from the tension but man was it fun to watch. I did have that guilt though watching it maybe this is the kind of stuff she can do on my birthday if I asked her lmao okay that's enough creepiness. Okay I gotta stop now I need to cut my nails haha cya guys next week then, and until next time... I don't think I'm moving to WordPress because I can do anything here considering my JavaScript knowledge and WordPress... I don't have money to host this haha bye<br /></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Man is... *ahem*, KING AMUSEMENT CREATIVE ie. an Anime production company, releasing episodes of their old archive online including, you guessed it, Seitokai Yakuindomo which aired back in 2010. Yeah, I went on a marathon last night on this for like half of first season and man did I miss a lot of stuff from that series. I guess they did make it boring on the OVAs with just jokes and no plot progression (well "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/surume" target="_blank">Surume</a> to Takatoshi" is good haha) so it didn't stick well. Like really, the movies were better maybe that's why they're doing that now. Can't wait for that to appear... next year? Haha yeah so I can laugh at more jokes only I can understand lol</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
