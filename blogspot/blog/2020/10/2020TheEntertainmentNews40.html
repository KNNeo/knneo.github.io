<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O9UQqeq49do/X3ltQ-NktjI/AAAAAAAA-ng/IuSj6SXPiHMUhPMjJk6wFn0MVHSxd_G1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tonikawa01_tsukasa2.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Man, why are the new shows I want to watch this season all about smart kids lol okay I wouldn't call Makoto smart but *laughs* <div><br /></div><div>  Hmm... I don't have much for this month's Otaku Package haha but at least I   paid for something, so there's at least one thing now. Haha me trying to find   more things to justify the international shipping it's so dumb. Also, I'm   thinking of... crossing the line with calendars here with AV actresses but,   uh, I worry for nudity so I'm holding back for now. I'll see what it looks   like based on reviews of Twitter fan images then we will see. I can't think of   any alternatives for calendars for next year too tbh </div><div><br /></div><div>  Well, let's cut to the chase, yes? If you see this posted early compared to   previous ones because specifically on the day of this post, 7pm is Uesaka   Sumire Instagram live, and 9pm is Touyama Nao Instagram live. Problem is,   Sumipe decided to do 2 hours. Yeah. I wish I haven't liked any of them or if   the pandemic ever existed they would have never got to this haha then again   she's freelance now I suppose </div><div><br /></div><div>  ANIME NOW! I can't WAIT to get laid with Akarin in Anime haha the photobook   earlier this year was just a taste </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="MajoTabi01">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Majou no Tabitabi</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "For me to be the youngest graduated witch, it doesn't seem to be       interesting for the rest of the witches in the country" I mean, that's       called jealousy you know how long some of them took to become even an       apprentice? lol     </div>  </blockquote>  Wait, how did Elaina keep her broom when she landed? Did she shoved it up her-   Okay in this very healthy series that I shouldn't make jokes of   (#MajoTabi01) we, uh... see the realities of life. No really, from the   perspective of a 14-year-old. So, let's give you a summary of Elaina's...   first three years as a magician. Well, it all started from reading a novel   series or probably, diary series of a witch, and makes her aspire to become   one as a kid. And so she worked hard for it, and graduated as the youngest   graduate in the country. Hey, if that doesn't make anyone jealous, think   again. Because since the world's requirement here is to ask for an existing   witch to recognise her abilities to become a full fledged one, everyone is   shunning her just because. It's sad, but hey, that's the reality right there,   girl. Really makes me wonder why she never questioned why is it such a case,   but you know, I got my current life pretty easily already so don't ask me   about rejection. *laughs* Anyways, she overheard her parents talk about a   passing by witch named Fran on the outskirts of the country, and she decides   to try out on someone who isn't in town, so maybe she won't think she's some   kind of genius only or something. Surprisingly, she got took in easily, so   yeah, gotta have a drawback, isn't it? The Stardust Witch accepts her as a   discipline, and then... she became a slave. Again, Elaina, if you have watched   the many <a href="https://jisho.org/search/majo" target="_blank">majo</a> Anime out there, you're doing it wrong. Everyone makes the same   mistake anyways, so let me tell you the way. *lifts up glasses* Firstly,   always question anything and everything. Not like, being a jerk, but putting   up with everything is a mistake. We'll talk about that later anyways, so I'll   just say in passing. Just like in real life, if you really have questions   about how the world works, you can always ask. But then again in this case   it's unlikely going to work since Fran will just shun her anyways. For a   month, even. So secondly, know the situation. As mentioned before, we talked   about why her as a genius isn't practically accepted throughout the state,   mainly because anyone you ask to be your sensei will be such a loser compared   to you, and that's not your fault honestly because it's always on the surface   anyways, but that's kind of a two-sided sword (or wand), so I won't say much.   Lastly, feel it out. I mean, she did break so that's good, and that's also   what Fran wanted to do to her? Yes, cue the parents, I guess. I hate to think   this is a scam, and if you also wonder how Fran has a year to do this lol, but   since Elaina will take every opportunity she could to become a witch, she'll   do all it takes, even if it means doing chores for a month and then getting   trashed in magic fights haha that's cool though tbh. And I think Fran   knows it too: Why is this girl not complaining? She's not a POW, she's not a   slave bought with money; (*gets employee deja vu*) Why wouldn't you question anything? Think about it.   So yeah yeah, she broke the heck out of this innocent girl, for I would like   to say she's already matured as she is for her age, so besides people who shun   her and not take her seriously, I would say Fran has tried her best to do what   the parents ask of her: Let her learn of hardship. Because you know,   experience <i>is </i>hardship. It's never easy, you always lose, and even if   you win you'll never forget you're just balancing in the rope of life, just   like everyone else. Okay, as to why I was convinced to watch this for the   season, at least, with a three-episode rule. It's kind of funny. And that's   good enough. I expected this to be some serious shit (it is), but thankfully   it isn't. From Fran being fran-tic (haha I'm sorry) to the father crying lol,   there is some level of jokes we can take once in a while, so thanks for this   not being like, a Fate series or something. Then, it's the direction of the   Anime so far. It's just adventure. So yeah, more on the slice-of-life elements   probably in the future, and that's why I have to watch two more episodes to   make a formal decision. It's like me recognising this Anime as an Anime-   That's not done by me that's the Anime production doing it on the author lol.   Lastly, the cast. I mean, if anything, I think Ede-chan (Hondo Kaede) bring   Elaina is already good enough reason to give this a try. Fran is Kana-chan   (Hanzawa Kana) but with a more matured tone until you cry in front of her lol,   and there are more familiar voices as we move on. So yeah, let's hope we get   to talk of them soon haha. It's been some time since I gave such a series,   previously along the lines of "Kami no Nai Nichiyoubi" which is like 2012?   Haha yeah, so... I'll give this a go. The whole package is great so far, I   know it's kind of an adult story which will hopefully lessen as time goes by   because I see cheeky Elaina at the end of this first episode as a great entry   to drama lol, and man, Harry Potter might be awesome but this is pretty cool   too. *laughs* We'll see how far this takes me. Get it? Because I'm on an   adventure too? I have a feeling this is a feature-episode style thing (as in   every week she goes somewhere and meets new people), so don't get too used to   Fran because we got new people coming right up! Yes, Ede-chan is good enough   for now hehe 18 years old too so that's good she'll show up half naked now   lmao bye</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ha8Fqm2qL0w/X3lt2mhrWTI/AAAAAAAA-nw/MO9JknOROQArFmohMLs2icQuYhzIF1cwgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majoutabi01_elaina2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        This is pretty cool, actually.<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TdlvT_8fjOA/X3lt6KCHKnI/AAAAAAAA-n0/7NTKd1ljyaIlAd0L5tStvye8EZBExhSxACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majoutabi01_elaina4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        MFW Saturday's over and Animal Crossing reminds me Sunday is the start         of a new week lol<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. *after seeing the Stardust Witch* "Maybe I'll just go back..."

And I'm feeling pissed. And envious. And my bestie   just got a girl to date and you give me this Anime?? Yes, I'm in. *laughs* That is my   first impression of this series, so let's get into it. In the first episode of   marriage (#ToniKawa01) I, uh, highly suspect this guy has never seen a   woman before. And I've seen at least twice by his age. *laughs* Okay, my   story aside, let's talk about this miracle of a story. Ignoring that it's from   the same author as "Hayate no Gotoku" series which ended like, a decade ago,   uh... I don't know where to start haha. For starters, SCREW YOU KANOKARI lmao   wait what. *laughs* No seriously, we got a lot to talk about just this episode   alone. So, in case you haven't heard of this series, and I don't until like a   couple of weeks ago where Kitou Akari (who voices Tsukasa) dropped this on me   and I replied "Yes" as fast as Nasa-kun could (lol), but yes, this is the   Anime. Firstly, I would like to warn you, don't doubt this miracle. Yes, don't   even. I know the Anime talked about the story of Kaguyahime like, 3 times at   least (I'm not good at math so if I'm wrong don't blame me) and it really   sounds like no one would ever trust this dude who is so desperate for her in   any case, but that is it. It's literally... well, besides getting hit by a   truck so I assume Nasa-kun here is already bonkers (lol) (okay he wasn't   before it so), but yes, it's just his confession and the girl said yes. That's   it. Plus, getting married. To you know, seal the deal? Haha which is why I   would like you all, yes you included dear reader, to just take this Anime as   some guy who wholeheartedly asked her out and she didn't think this guy is bad   even with injuries, and actually agreed to it. So, story. Story goes that,   because of his name (I've clarified that in the quote above lol) he decides to   prove people otherwise that he is not to be laughed at (I would argue your   confidence is something to laugh at already haha), even if it means aiming for   top university without a backup plan. Man, this guy's got all the balls. But   then, as he mentioned it himself, he got distracted. Pretty reminiscent of   real life where we are in middle school too (those were the days... haha), but   all it takes is for one girl you like to appear and your whole life changes.   Yes, the author may have exaggerated this if you didn't notice (including the   bleeding lol), but yeah, this is roughly what it feels like to fall in love.   Trust me, I have my days too haha. You get the iconic scene you see in the   trailer, and I really didn't expect them to play it this long to be honest (I   mean, you saw the truck driver's reaction? lol), but yeah, and then he finally   collapsed. I would argue that Kurosaki Ichigo from "BLEACH" didn't last as   long as this guy did lmao. After waking up, of course, she is nowhere to be seen, so   he probably thought it was a dram, amongst other things. So, as with any other   Anime, you have to ask questions. (See, Elaina? It's not that hard) (lol) And   so he did. To think that he may have done a confession even like, half awake,   and then the girl saying "if you marry me" to be together?   <strike>That sounds like a plot for an Anime</strike> That sounds too good to   be true, that's for sure. But she's cute, I'll give you that. Not really my type even for 2D standards, but sure. *laughs* Hey, what can I say? He likes   the girl. I guess he didn't say how long he took to stay hospitalised, or   whether his parents were with him at some point. I mean, he only mentioned he   left his parents to live alone because he can't take their nonsense anymore,   and probably hiding the secret of his reason behind not going to university as   any parent would ask. Still, this guy's a genius, so he'll live it out. Yes,   that's why the intro of this post. Even at work, he's so good. *laughs* Such a   wasted talent, isn't it? But hey, they say happiness is real important, so   I'll take a woman I love too, thank you. Okay wow this is quite a long one   already, so let's wrap up a little since we can talk about buffet-level   holding hands and sleeping any time of this series lmao. So, a couple of   things you have to understand by this episode. Firstly, about marriage. In   Japan, the minimal legal age is 16. And yes, I assume with the cherry blossoms   out and Tsukasa suddenly popping in front of his place probably through   searching around for a while, this is precisely what Tsukasa was waiting for ie. Her 16th birthday,   because there's the agreement back then. And yes, you need guardian   consent. I'm going to leave the doubts for later, but suffice it to say, you   don't need to have parents around to get married (that is not wrong, because   what if your parents don't get to see... you... get married) (oh, me) (haha)   so I guess screw you Nasa-kun's parents, and you can register for marriage any   time of the day. Even at night. Is this how celebrities do it? Hmm, cheeky,   isn't it. *laughs* Secondly, about getting hit by a truck. Again, I   didn't&nbsp;expect to learn some first aid emergency knowledge in this Anime   lol, but for starters, Tsukasa mentioned a lot about emergency, so for us   lucky bastards who didn't cross the road and get T-boned by a truck (lmao), I   hope we all learnt something from this. How long Nasa-kun has survived to do   the confession though, that's what we'll talk about next. So lastly, about all   this being a scam, specifically, because of Tsukasa. Again, I said not to doubt this   series, and you shouldn't because have you read the manga haha, but yes, the   author did leave a lot of clues to let you think this might be a trap all the   same. I'll summarise that to the hints about Kaguyahime (if you watched the   episode thanks for the summary of the story because I'm sorry Studio Ghibli if   I didn't watch that Anime to learn of this story), Tsukasa's dictionary level   knowledge (the easy explanation is that she might be also a bookworm like Nasa-kun,   which then makes them a good pair haha) (ugh my heart), and Nasa-kun's reactions about all this. So, since the author has made this easy on him to   accept this reality, he made him a confident person in life to pursue anything   he wants (so yeah, even asking a girl out), while still doing things in   impulse - or as he says, "faster than NASA" - at the right time, as in signing   the papers. All these combinations must be the perfect situation for them to   be together. Well, in the Anime sense, of course. Man, Kazuya you can go screw   yourself because I wish like everything else I've gotten in life, I can get my   marriage this easy haha I wish. Meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy 11 more episodes   of this at least, unless I can't stand the opening theme (if you saw who did   the music for the series you'll know) and can't give the ending theme but   unlikely this is not as bad as "Hanako-kun" I'll give something haha   Akarin~<br /></div><div>  [TL:DR; As Kitou Akari who voiced Tsukasa   <a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1312068109088387076?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: "It was a great final episode... Congrats on the marriage! (Episode 1)" lol   get it because marriage is always the ending for romance shows]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O9UQqeq49do/X3ltQ-NktjI/AAAAAAAA-ng/IuSj6SXPiHMUhPMjJk6wFn0MVHSxd_G1gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tonikawa01_tsukasa2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Any girl's reaction when I ask her out lol<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Tco2-k8-FE/X3ltaAeco4I/AAAAAAAA-nk/cwkBu2tLMIIfnEBRegHDilMdwc9x6AzjACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tonikawa01_nasa3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        I admire this guy's enthusiasm tbh haha<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Okay James we know you like       fake paintings lol     </div>  </blockquote>  Is it just me or can I not forget about Cynthia's love story from last week?   Ah, I wished I was a painter lol. In this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER13)   where what's gone is hardly ever going to come back, hey at least Thomas' art   skills were back. So, story. Story is now that Thomas is found, but he's in   debt. Long story short, remember last week where James scouted Thomas out to   be a great counterfeiter? Yeah, it changed his life for good or for worse. And   of course, Cynthia isn't buying it. (Get it? Because artwork) Along the days,   Thomas got richer because you know, the plan for James is that he paints   artwork real enough it can get vetted by James as real, and then... if the   actual one appears then we're screwed. Remember in an interview in the episode   he said he studied? Yeah, it's just to assure that this artwork he was going   to ask Thomas to paint is, you know, already missing. Haha this is so screwed   up I can't even. So yeah, to the extent that moving up his status is also the   start of James psycho-ing him that his woman should be left out. Hey, it's   that career vs love question again, isn't it. But seriously though, if a girl   asks me to work MacDonald's for my current job, I'll never say no. It's for   her, man. Canned beans are a small price to pay (Get it? The beans are small   too- I'm sorry) just to be with your loved one. I guess not, considering you   won't be warm in winter. The reason then, that Thomas got into debt, after   Cynthia left him, is that he realised that his "artwork" were then placed in   real museums for others to look at, and that, is ridicule to Art itself. I   mean, really, he should know as a painter. Then again he could have not   visited the local museum lmao. Anyways, he took the turn, buying back all the   art he has created for James, which of course, forced him into debt because   what else he's going to use to pay to bid out those artwork. But even through   all this, Makoto did actually convince him to paint the counterfeit for Snow   of London mainly because... he stole that box Cynthia was holding haha. That   box, which contained, not a joke, a drawing of a wedding ring. Aw, how sweet.   Stopping her for the moment though, let's talk about how things are going with   this heist. Abbie had to swallow her own pride (if she has any) to you know,   get closer to James literally (ugh), but also, report on what Laurent is about   being a black market art seller to the mafia. Laurent tips him about an   upcoming auction that James can participate to buy back that painting Laurent   outbid in the first place (the original, by the way), and then of course, scam   him by giving a fake and taking back all the money plus profit in the first   place because, you know, it's currently rated at 30 million euros now. They   gotta take their money back somehow. So, to conclude on the arc, I suppose   with next episode they have to touch on two things: (1) whether James will get   scammed for real. I sure hope so for this one he has seen the real one. Well,   I forgot we're supposed to also scam Fran not him so we shall see how that   goes haha. And (2) Cynthia's feelings for Thomas. Hey, this is even more   unlikely to happen though, as she would probably argue that she can't revert   back on her rich swindler life now, mainly because I would argue for her that   it's technically social justice, and the guilt is lesser? Haha I wouldn't say   that but see how Makoto has blended in so much now. *laughs* So yeah, let's   actually see if any of these will take off, but as with every arc so far, I'm   sure it'll go swimmingly well. For Cynthia though... if you want to retire   from this we understand hehe cya guys next week</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DeT9IU1umkk/X3lvhgtBOWI/AAAAAAAA-oY/JQRkk1T0id0LfOGzMFtbA06IiDB9C9qgwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender13_cynthia2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Happiness is...<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UgtuN5EvdRo/X3lvhXbRRGI/AAAAAAAA-oU/aJquWtZBPzIMu6eZQICt1LeCLok0ggeFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender13_ring.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Happiness (to a woman) is...<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. *James points to below him* I legit thought someone was going to suck   d*ck lol Abbie how low have to sunk to haha </div><div>  P.P.S. "You (Cynthia) wanted to be a stage actress" I mean, she is still now   haha. Her acting skills weren't useful on guys like Sam though lol<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>      <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  So, this week, and let's talk about this quick since this is likely also the only thing which is great, <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new album</b> is... I guess, going to join the list of albums this year which I got many songs out of (others include Asakura Momo, yorushika and so on), as I give like, 5 songs already at this point. Yeah, without much hesitation too. Well, mostly because like, I know 2 songs from artist I know of (literally one of them is also composer of yorushika, yes n-buna, which I did not know of when the lyric video of this written song was played early this year, and I thought it was good) (it's fate haha), and the rest... are just me wanting to hear more Mia-san. Mostly being cute, and sometimes being like everyone else because I could use some emotional songs once in a while. Also, because <b>Anime "GREAT PRETENDER" Original Soundtrack</b> was literally released last week and if you didn't hear me talk about how good the current arc is, then you're missing out on the one song they've played on this week's episode like, 3 times. *laughs* I gotta give it now haha. Oh yeah and lastly, <b>YuNi's new single</b> which almost gave me hope on giving the B-side ever since the digital single which was some ending theme *wink* Uzaki-chan *wink* and (saw potential to do a physical release and) released a proper release, almost made me want to give the single in full. Don't worry, the second listen of the song on the way home killed it real good haha I was in the mood at work to listen the first time apparently lol<br />  <br />  So, in news concerning music or not as I would see fit and that is on Twitter, <b>yanaginagi's new album is coming due December</b> (thank goodness I gave the one song a couple of months ago), I guess <b>KANA-BOON has a new song</b> for that firefighting Anime, <b>Anime "ToniKawa" theme songs</b> are already on digital if you have music subscriptions or something (ending theme recommended unless you like... rap?), and this has nothing to do with music but I want to say and you can probably Google it yourself, <b>romance harem series "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/122990/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy" target="_blank">OsaMake</a>" is getting an Anime adaptation</b>. Why this last time is particular spicy is mainly because apart from the perfect cast which I swear it's not coincidental (Minase Inori is the childhood friend who is jealous of everyone you meet, and will eventually rid of them I assume) (I mean, read the title dude), the main guy of this harem is also... that one guy. Matsuoka. Yes. Harem kind of Anime haha so yay? At least they're going to enjoy the recording in the studio lol<br />  <br />So for next week, we have a slew of releases I have no much idea about so going in blind, from <b>ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new single</b> which is quite some time already (last was in 2018?) and I've heard nothing thus far, to <b>GLIM SPANKY's new album</b> which I swear I've not touched them since last year or even 2018 tbh (okay I did mention them in the Digital Singles Week I did some months ago but I didn't give anything, I promise you), to I almost forgot <b>Waki Azumi's new single</b> is also next week because I like the one - shockingly this time around - topic song that is also an Anime theme song (don't try to read the title, don't), so let's see if she can continue to make me like her (songs) third time coming. Again, it's one song every time so I would like to break the record if she didn't having 3 more songs... that I don't give a damn about every time haha Columbia Japan's budget is off the charts lol<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  So yeah, it's still going as I am still writing this and you will see posted if you are that on time (lol please, me), Naobou is still doing her Instagram live. And if you did watch from like, 7pm or 8pm Japan Time with Sumipe and her 2 hours (Jesus Christ) live and then she jumped into Naobou's stream for like about an hour and she then said that she doesn't have a schedule on this so she'll see how long this goes... Good chances I'm going to hear this until I sleep tonight haha. Hey, what a time to live in, isn't it? It's barely even anything a decade ago, man. So kids, what you see now... *laughs* Okay, feeling old already listening to older women talk (haha sorry), so I'll see you next week. I have a harsh feeling the upcoming package is coming real soon, and we may not have to wait until next weekend to see it. With that set aside, enjoy your next week ahead because I know I won't haha, and until then... take care of yourselves. Not because the President of United States of America is also infected, but... I mean, just in general. I can barely keep up with my health with the unhealthy lifestyle I'm living I AM WATCHING MIDNIGHT LIVESTREAMS MAN WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE haha bye<br />  <script>    var hashtags = new Array();     for(var topic of document.getElementsByClassName("anime"))     {       hashtags.push( { tag: topic.id.substring(0,topic.id.length-2), target: topic.id } );     }     for(let item of hashtags)     {     let newItem = document.createElement('a');     newItem.style.paddingRight = '3px';     newItem.innerText = '#' + item.tag;     newItem.href = '#' + item.target;     document.getElementById("hashtags").appendChild(newItem);     }   </script></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
