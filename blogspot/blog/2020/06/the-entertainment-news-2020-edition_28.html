<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #26</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zC2COxdUgKY/Xvgi2o1x19I/AAAAAAAA8f8/RZEKdWyF8tUjC4FW_Ms1DiyMpKaJdeHRgCK4BGAsYHg/kaguyaS212_jackoff.gif" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Yeah, I added more girls in there. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><div><br /></div><div>And yes, I AM talking about the Wanted List page on this blog because I can't get enough of Oonishi Saori on YouTube and thought the other 3 I also added in deserves some recognition also I can now come to this place to look at their latest pics without being a creep on Twitter lol that's my excuse</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyways, welcome back, and yeah I should've gone for more Manga reading or something but I wanted to take a break and... well, the above, so... Haha forgive me then I hope next week's post won't be a blank page since next season Anime doesn't start until the following week based on what I chose so far</div><div><br /></div><div>Note: As of post date of this post that Anime blog site I trust hasn't published the list yet, so I'll update below whenever. Or heck, even put that on the next issue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai?</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Let's say you're boyfriend and girlfriend" Kaguya's reaction to this is the best this series lmao I think I'm masochist haha</div></blockquote>Hey, just a suggestion? That the photo of Kaguya-sama only lies within the Student Council doors? Come on, she can have a photo of her somewhere outside of the family. In this final episode of this glorious series (#KaguyaSamaS212) I can confirm that photographer <strike>is a pervert</strike> is us. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, representative of the male audience probably, females I don't know. Then again if you're female and you watch a shounen series I'm pretty sure you're with us. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, the guys's the principal?? Oops. Anyways, THANK GOODNESS there isn't any Kaguya dad scenes. Like seriously, if there were any I'm quitting haha. So, I guess a couple of shorts to end the season. Firstly, photos for the Student Council. You know, the one with Miko-chan in it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, the principal brought his camera in to take photos, but as of family rules Kaguya is not allowed to be in those photos publicly (we will get back to that later), so he takes pictures of the others, probably pissing off the girl at the same time lol. But you know, we gotta have that private session. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, since the friends wanted it, at some points photos taken will not count towards the magazine that the principal is taking for, so that's good right? Well, she dropped her phone. Well, before you start screaming on what will happen to all her (photo) memories, don't you worry because it's a N*kia it won't break- Oh, it's Japan so they only have S*ny *rics*n? Oh that one I don't know I hear those don't last a fall from a building lol. Mobile phone jokes aside, yeah it's beyond hope (but I swear you can at least recover storage without letting the father know <span title="*wink*">😉</span>) (don't ask me though I'm not a Computing Science student lol) so Kaguya had to let all her... memories... go. But we're not done yet. Being positive like Hayasaka looking at new phones lol, we finally get to have Kaguya buy a new one. And just like how the President of USA has to change to a smartphone at some point (FYI it was Obama, on his second term, go look it up) for formal purposes, Kaguya got the latest model. Take that, 5G! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, she got it, but she isn't happy. I mean, her feels are like me when I don't know how to backup my PC storage as a kid. No really, we just throw the whole CPU away, no joke haha. That or if you remember <strike>floppy disks</strike> the save icon I save the most important stuff there. Yep. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Old technologies aside, we can't wait for Kaguya to be a hip teenager and start messaging day and night with Shirogane- wait a minute why only is the guy flinching at this? Then again, I would argue that if we can't talk about Shinomiya affairs then social media shouldn't be the alternative considering those have track records or what we call auditing, which can be exposed to hackers. So yeah, just talk to her. Idiots. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ignoring that, since they can create a chat group now that Kaguya has caught up with the new era lol, they shared all their photos with her. Hey, restoration complete. And that's why you have friends. You may have lost all your personal photos (or girls you like on Instagram I hope you have saved their posts at least lmao), but photos with others they will never go away. Especially with cloud save now, it'll NEVER go away. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sorry for the deep meaning behind all this, but hey, at least Kaguya cheered up, so good job guys for breaking her old phone lmao. To end the series, they played a balloon pump dare game. If you have seen that Takagi-chan livestream where Rieri and Kaji Yuki played a round you get the idea, but otherwise yeah it's just whoever it pops on. Not a porno by the way, Miko-chan. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> ("too-pure-pure-girl" haha) (then again if she knows of such stuff is she pure though? hmm...) It's as usual <a href="https://jisho.org/search/hikiwake" target="_blank">a draw</a> between two people similar to the livestream as mentioned above, but yeah, they had to end it with a... blast. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Overall, this season has brought us a lot of laughs, and in place of that shit father of the Shinomiya family we got other people's backstories instead which are great, don't get me wrong, but you know, I could do with more laughs haha. Is the sports equipment room scene the best part already? And the doctor analysis after that? Yeah, that left an impression lmao. *watches episode again* Haha okay I'm right <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I would argue Miko-chan isn't much of an addition to the already screwed up Student Council (and I'm not a pedo lol) but suffice it to say that they have to add to the spice that is this Anime already so I wouldn't mind. But otherwise, did it surpass the first season? I wonder. Yeah probably, but mainly because I laughed too much on this one I forgot the first haha. And there's the "Kaguya DAY" on the actual air date ie. 27th July 2020 which showed you all the episodes thus far for the whole day with livestream talks so if you didn't tear up enough go ahead and tear up more haha. All in all, I'm glad I watched this and forgave that irritating sh*t of a narrator because now he's not irritating anymore, just like how the rest of the unhappy stuff in this show I just forget. Haha hey, I gotta. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Okay yes this is a good show it's hard to get one to surpass this lol I said it I'm not tsundere like those two haha bye<div><div></div><div><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PN9SZMUKE0/Xvgja_dlRfI/AAAAAAAA8gc/Ipi6TVlHXYEV406Af6_wPik-cvX1_TorgCK4BGAsYHg/s320/kaguyaS212_miko6.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Is it a problem if I put Miko-chan for the final episode of the season I DON'T CARE SHE'S CUTE haha<br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3MxuwV2P0Ec/Xvgjbab0oeI/AAAAAAAA8gg/CM9ffjZu5jQha1M6adUXZlsnQ_tISaM9gCK4BGAsYHg/s320/kaguyaS212_photo2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Is it a problem if I put Miko-chan for the final episode of the season I DON'T CARE SHE'S CUTE haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. If you don't know the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/seishun" target="_blank">Aoharu</a> ka yo" reference please help yourself to the dozens of translated YouTube videos of Kaguya-sama's radio show "KokuRadio" where in this season they discuss about life events that coincidentally resembles the spirit of youth (the word "seishun" ie. youth can also&nbsp; be read as "blue spring" I did not provide the wrong link)<br />P.P.S. "I feel that you have just betrayed me" Haha Hayasaka I feel that too but it's the last episode we can cut her some slack also your enthusiasm for technology makes you a waste as being a butler have you considered journalism? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></div><div>[END OF SEASON SPECIAL!!!

I did say I want to listen more than just the one release out this week, but, uh... I really needed to sleep working in office is more tiring than work from home haha (Please give me more excuses to use next week haha I don't have to anyways) so we're listening to <b>Fukuhara Kaori's new single</b> this week. It's fine, and again I have said to myself many times she sounds like halca-san who did the ending theme for the first season Anime (Fukuhara also voices the cheerleader female leader btw), and I'm glad the B-side sucks because I don't want to another Klassic Note Review this quick- Is this why recent reviews have decreased? Uh oh haha<br /><br />On news concerning music on Twitter if there is any, <b>GLIM SPANKY released a new digital single</b> of which I did not give but I did review it so don't go on about me not giving a sh*t, <b>Amamiya Sora's YouTube channel has music videos which have hit 100k views</b> even though it's just a preview not in full, and... and... I can't come up with another one to make it three. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay this segment is really getting shorter I need to go listen to new artists now<br /><br />For next week, finally and finally because of delays, <b>SHE'S new album</b> is going to make me happy to start July with them and hopefully we got more good songs to give. Not that I'm hoping for much, but if otherwise I promise to give those indie artist websites a visit. Man, is second half of this year in Klassic Note going to be real dull if I don't watch Anime and give their theme songs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So yeah, I'm done. You guys saw the new mini-game in "Alternative Girls" where you... can... massage... girls now I'm not a pedo. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Pity it's part of a larger game mechanic where I have to play the games inside decently until I can earn rewards to do so, but for now I'm just going to enjoy touching high schoolers' feet. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Anyways, cya guys next week then, and until next time... if this is what I get to enjoy nowadays, it's no wonder I want to buy more idol merch and apply for work leave so I can wait for them to arrive lol I'm still thinking about it though</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Will change up the Anime List site to display slightly more information in a more interactive interface. So far, you can go to once again, my GitHub Page to play around for now.<br /><div id="hiddenTags" style="font-size: 0em;">KaguyaSama</div></div></div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
