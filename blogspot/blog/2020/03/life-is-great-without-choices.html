<b>Life is great without choices. Because it sucks once you lose the ability to decide.</b><div><br></div><div>I mean, my mom is nothing to pity about. She's selfish, she sides her friends, she doesn't respect the family on any decisions or critique any of us might have. She's the mother though, and she still owns half the house, so if she wants to flip the house for renovation, not like me who has just started to work and gained some respect in the company can understand what it feels to not be listened when you cannot argue with your mother since she doesn't care.</div><div><br></div><div>That, I guess I'll live with to realise once I move up the corporate ladder eventually. Eventually.</div><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
