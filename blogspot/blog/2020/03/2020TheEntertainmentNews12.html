<h2>The Entertainment News 2020 Edition Issue #12</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kfNrgtNK5LI/Xnckf0vXSLI/AAAAAAAA59c/wgI7740VcWsXrb-GaNSEznjAWEjV8SWFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri11_kuro2.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>Okay I don't want to watch Anime and listen to music anymore LET ME GO BACK TO MY ISLAND!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><br />What did I tell you, guys. So again, if you don't see images here or if they are not from the show but from the game it's not your browser rendering problem (lmao), but also because I'm getting my desk top (as in table top, get it?) changed today instead of yesterday because of some newbie (hey, I get you but), so... expect super haphazard reviews this week haha THANK GOODNESS there aren't any new songs to listen I may not be for the rest of the week even if there are haha<br /><br />Let's start then. I'll try to focus on this instead of thinking of when my new villagers are coming lol okay let's<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HatenaIllusion10"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Hatena Illusion</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I'm thinking of a finishing move... It came up last night when I was out of the bath" Wow Hatena-chan I don't know what it is but <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></div></blockquote>So it's going to be three episodes of Hatena failing? I'll look forward to that haha. In this new episode (#HatenaIllusion10) somehow Gregory knows of the magic village and its people, so he presents them with a message from that old woman: get these three Artifacts back and yo mama will be released. Sure, the guys are going to jump on this, but if you think this is another trip of that fat woman being the final boss then think again. Because in this episode, we're getting into action. It's an order from the old woman ie. the grandmother from the village. It's literally seeing forth a challenge. So, since we all care about the <i>real</i> MVP of the series Maeves-san (haha not true), everyone we know so far is going to help. So, the objective to end the series so far is to obtain three lost Artifacts. I'm not going to name them because why would I, but one of them is tasked to Mamoru, who will disguise his magic show overseas so that the kids can go take it back. But before we get to the good part, I really thought there will be evil in this one, but so far so good. I mean, everyone is so good, the kids with the father left for Australia. So... no one is taking care of the house now? Okay. The bad guys are coming in though, just so you know, Jeeves-san. Surprisingly, they were all prepared. A group of people are ready to infiltrate the mansion while the family members were away (ikr Mariah-san doesn't count haha) (okay Jeeves-san cares about her so I'll take it), so the ones left ie. secondary characters, prepare for a good fight. Firstly, Mariah's infiltration of a research lab for a hidden Artifact and...? Turns out, these bad guys are researching on how to create Artifacts without the use of magic. So, easy solution, just blow them up into pieces. Hey, there's a family tradition to protect, you know. And that went real well. The second requires a little more work since partially they don't know where it is. So, cue Michelle Lin, obviously Mariah in disguise leaking info of the Hoshisato family leaving the mansion empty (obviously not knowing the mansion ITSELF is an Artifact), telling it off to the bunch about infiltrating it for goodies, and they did. Interestingly, Hoshinozawa with her boss-like skills took down normal people equivalent to an army of soldiers easily, and the magic stuff was left to Jeeves to clear up. Excuse me, not the old man, <i>cool</i> Jeeves. Really, Dragonball Z needs to re-consider their character design this guy is too OP he may be more than 9000 lmao. While the guys are kept busy being "entertained" at the mansion, the big guys sat down with tea but is interrupted by Kikyouin's father, who also has an Artifact in his possession. He tells the bad guys their men are pretty much screwed right now, and asks for the location of one of the three Artifacts to save Maeves-san. And since his Artifact is a pair of glasses who can read minds... well I mean, that sure is easy, isn't it? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, it's magic-powered, what can I say? Also, if you think he's not leaving there alive, he's not because those guys are leaving first... for the afterlife. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, this is as cool as it gets, guys. Appreciate it while it lasts. I'm soaking it in like a sponge though, really wanted this level of action for some time, really. Kikyouin (the daughter) however, gets to stay at home out of danger since if you would remember she can't even get an Artifact to call its name through the any number of random house "intrusions" she did over the years lol. For next episode.. impress me, Anime. We're just getting started, aren't we? I know, that "smile stick" thing is going to make all this action so uncool real soon haha is that what the grandmother was about keeping the family image alive? The old woman is this series' director? lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f6Zj0JJrOjo/XncBtX1hTJI/AAAAAAAA57w/SGrRPGZHizMTwTniG9rbwI3GdL9TeaOtwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion10_car.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">These animation drawings are so shitty I can't even</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jWHZQWrNgts/XncBsxUjWcI/AAAAAAAA57s/RiYQ1v7ln3YaXbUIWCJah_fu3Pla7a0wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hatenaillusion10_mariah3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Did Mariah just blink to an old man?

Not like Mitsuba doesn't deserve more episodes of himself, but I feel like at this point we should've known the truth by now, whatever it is. Instead, we are taken further deep into the abyss, never to be known of the truth. Hey, we got close last week. Not this week though. We continue with the story of the Third of the Seven Wonders, who, unfortunately, sacrificed itself since Tsukasa took care of him real quick, which already makes you wonder if Hanako even has such levels of power considering the lack of direct confrontation so far. Besides, it doesn't even happen; Tsukasa just hugs the shit out of his twin brother on contact. Still, many questions we <i>still</i> can't figure out still exist, and we're <i>still</i> stuck with Mitsuba's lack of reason in many cases than other. Story first, I guess. Firstly, Hanako needs to get into that Boundary, and you know, destroy that Yorishiro so they can't use their powers anyhow and of course, be manipulated by rumours and such. So, he and Kou enlist the help of... that fox and spider haha. So knowledge lessons, people. Suffice it to say that each Seven Wonder controls an aspect within the school, with the spider on memories (with the library), and the fox on space. And even with the Yorishiro broken, that doesn't mean the Boundary is off limits no more. So, let's just make Tsuchigomori's words easy to understand: it's like getting into the forum site without authentication. Breaking the Yorishiro is just revoking admin permission, doesn't mean cannot go in. Besides, the authentication is here, it's Hanako-kun himself. So it shouldn't be a problem. Centering around this episode though, is the real problem as we all struggle to see how that idiot Kou would still think Mitsuba is human in any way. According to Tsukasa, Mitsuba was still "alive" as an apparation because he took what was left of him after the last time he was seen (I don't know what being dead is after death but) to.... I guess take part of his soul and give him a vessel, if any spirit-based shows have taught me? Sure is creepy, since I mean Tsukasa just ripped out the heart of a Seven Wonder to power this Mitsuba, it still is far far away from the ghost Mitsuba we have known since we first met him. But still, Kou still keeps asking him out like a man would to a girl (lol) and hopes to be friends with him again? Man, what's your f**king problem. Tsukasa, meanwhile, is making use of Mitsuba's fear of knives (lol Hanako) to start attacking the trio in defence including the one defenceless Yashiro who can be seen... well she isn't dead yet thank goodness, but all in all it was a meaningless fight. Really, Tsukasa didn't even do anything. That might be the point too, because he was experimenting. And because he reasons like a kid, it's hard to even understand whatever this antagonist is thinking. Really, motive and all, we have no idea what is happening. This might be a good time to say why I don't like the plot of the series because we have only one episode left to go and we're still left with questions that the Anime doesn't intend to answer. It's like me running away from my life problems, and I don't like it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next episode though, I really wish something will get clarified as to how even Hanako can NEVER, EVER, get out of his mind to get rid of his twin brother AGAIN God he's so irritating lol I want to see a reasonable ending, Anime. Please make it happen. Cya guys next week.<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vpmjqyq8n8s/XncN2wx7mpI/AAAAAAAA58Y/1UiSVi4cF3I7HxMjdVhBxnP1G6mdlWhHgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun11_yashiro.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The cutest stuff this episode lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DQrqFdthZoA/XncN3pWjbAI/AAAAAAAA58c/hyqSMOKqFgcA7LF-O3485SRWgzBPaxkYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/hanakokun11_fox1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The cutest stuff this episode lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. *Tsukasa digs a heart out of the Seven Wonder* Man, really regretted watching this series I thought this was about cute girls haha<br />P.P.S.

Okay not making sex jokes here because Mitsuba is technically male so... sorry bro RIP again haha<br />[TL:DR; <strike>Kekkaishi was better than this</strike> Kyokou Suiri was better than this ugh]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="RikeKoi11"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Rikei ga Koi ni Ochita no de Shoumei Shite Mita.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Besides, I have no interest in this naggy four-eyes!" Haha Kanade-chan with the insults please me too hehe</div></blockquote>I know, Himuro. This guy needs to do a jail sentence for what he did. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (#RikeKoi11) the two are quarrelling. Hey, welcome to the most realistic episode of ALL TIME lmao I mean, science can't really explain this well too, huh. Hey also, GREAT episode to teach you guys to practice social distancing for the coronavirus these two are doing pretty well thus far. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, story. Story goes that... Himuro may have broke for getting less physical contact recently (it's like drugs but with a man) (haha), and kind of ranted it out on Yukimura so I have just saved you half an hour of watching this episode lol, but yeah, suffice it to say things went wrong. Kanade-chan is probably not at fault considering Himuro threw everything that went wrong so far in the experiments... yeah Yukimura it's all your fault. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Just as a joke though, but you get the idea. Firstly, how it happened. Well, some from last episode, but more from this one. It's mostly (I'm not going to pull out a pie chart, I promise) Himuro getting agitated about her relationship with Yukimura and his actions towards other girls without much thought... that's called jealousy, everyone. Nope, never felt that before since I don't have one. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Still, someone got into trouble, Yukimura was still telling the facts, but you know, most facts many people would not want to hear. Hey, no one said he has to suck up to people, but in this case bro? You may have to. Following the slap and the breakout (lol), of course the two have ruined the trip for the rest of them (not for Ibarada she's still playing Animal Crossing New Leaf on her 3DS haha GO AWAY) (she's probably playing some BL game though lol), so yeah, they sort of tried to make it up. Firstly, from Himuro. Good thing is, we know she brought it upon herself, her anger. Probably from past events (remember she got left out every damn time in the experiments since they were here?), and possibly from the presentation but I don't think so already since they proved it lol, but yeah, she got ahead of herself real fast. Not like Yukimura was someone with great EQ so reasoning won't help here anyways, so... I hope you got your confession letter ready bro she'll only accept that as an apology haha. Still, we get to see a little more into Himuro's past, of her getting bullied (*sigh*), of her not understanding love (I don't too to be honest), and her screwing such things up, to be honest. Okay, she didn't screw that up Yamamoto did it for her upcoming novel bestseller lmao way to keep the train wreck going, author. But she tried to hold it up altogether, and to apologise to Yukimura, to the extent of even getting him a gift. Now that is called sincerity. Yukimura, you better prove to us you can even do half of what a man can do without being science-type or else you are going down on the ikemen ranking for Anime characters haha. (Is there such a thing? Haha let me check) All in all a great episode to build up to the end of the series, I've enjoyed even these sad scenes so far, and man is it going to end well next week. Hey, this is as accurate they can get to a reconciliation don't shit on them okay? Stay strong people it's sad to know they got laid but I didn't <span title="*sob*">😢</span><br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gt140P0TKXE/XncY8y_bMtI/AAAAAAAA58w/uambtP3MsgQHgRt2jwrrYLp5l_g0JuEMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi11_yamamoto2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so evil I can't even<br />(STOP IT YAMAMOTO YOU'RE RUINING THINGS BITCH)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AQW4I3bDMbQ/XncY80LF3wI/AAAAAAAA580/gCJJtSVMFxEB-8WRHWXYG3QEmB_H-oKAQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/rikekoi11_himuro9.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so unglam I can't even</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Hey, human evil is on the uprising, people, do be aware. I'm not talking about the pandemic by the way haha. In this new episode (#KyokouSuiri11) we finally reach the ultimate conclusion to this big, big... mystery. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, conspiracy, more like. All done by one person. All done by... you guessed it, Nanase Karin. Wait, what? Okay, just a head's up, it's still Rikka-san, but yeah, that is Kotoko-chan's last solution. She says, Nanase is the killer of herself. Well, sort of herself. It's an accumulation of the solutions she presented so far, and this is the finishing blow. So yeah, she killed herself. Which also means, someone sacrificed for it. She found a scapegoat. Again, this is all fiction and mostly a lie, so remember that, for starters. So, who was it killed by a steel beam? It doesn't matter. How it happened? It doesn't matter. What we do know about Rikka-san's plan to overtake the world by storm through rumour and changing the future is that, she cannot prove herself. She cannot justify her actions. You think anyone will believe there's Steel Lady Nanase more than if Rikka-san is trying to test out youkai powers to rule the world potentially? Yeah, more likely so now because that rumour is dying down, and quickly. Firstly, Kotoko told another story. How all this was made up, and how Nanase still got away with all the crimes she did thus far, killing a scapegoat and Terada, for starters. Then, she made sure people would deduce the truth themselves. Well, "truth". The point that her first three solutions would not work doesn't matter, because it was meant to trigger interest in Nanase's death. But if we do the 360 and tell you that she planned all of this herself, all the solutions before would make sense, at least at its base. For example, if planning took time, it's always the best deduction that it's someone who did it to herself, in this case, so that she can put it all according to plan. Well, coincidences here do count but you know, we're just writing fiction we don't have to explain chance. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on, Nanse then made sure she kept herself clean, and started a new life as the other woman who died in her place. Perfect. Now no one will know. Makes sense now, doesn't it? And Kotoko gave the final blow by saying: Nanase is keeping the death alive so she can live her own life. Considering her life till then was such a scoop, it's easy to put that site up and make people believe she is still alive while she's away from this screwed up world to live the rest of her life without anyone knowing. Dramatic, cliche, weird, maybe it makes no sense, but this is a solution to a mystery Rikka-san cannot refute. Kotoko then points the finger to Rikka-san and tells her to prove that she is not Nanase Karin. Boy, is that going to be tough. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So there you have it. A wonderful conclusion to an otherwise dialogue heavy series, I would argue. But goddamn, was this quite a roller coaster ride. But yeah, that's it. They did it. Kuro-san almost went real close to dead dead but you know, Kotoko pulled him back up. Again, he is  immortal so it doesn't matter, but it's good to stop Rikka-san at her feet, literally. Man, is this satisfying. I'm like those guys at the forums now feeling satisfied of knowing the "truth" behind Nanase Karin's murder and whatever rumours about her that will die in a week lol. No literally, because we're at the end of this series already. Yeah. I guess it's a wrap up, hopefully we get to see <strike>Nanase Karin</strike> Rikka-san in person too, but hey, no one said it must be facts to make sure this works. We're not science-type anyways lol *looks at RikeKoi* The point is, because Kotoko is the "God of Wisdom", that she has to take such chances to otherwise explain stuff that would convince people to believe, in order to protect the spiritual world from falling apart. You know, in this case, a youkai monster holding a steel beam with a huge rack going around killing anything in her way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Please give me more romance and jealousy stuff next week to end it up haha bye<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vm62gwDD_Eg/XnckgEAz4RI/AAAAAAAA59g/cTYICMzJlmYHp9gErvEqWM8kRO2iUpmRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri11_couple1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Never thought I'll say this, but who's the immortal now, genius? haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kfNrgtNK5LI/Xnckf0vXSLI/AAAAAAAA59c/wgI7740VcWsXrb-GaNSEznjAWEjV8SWFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kyokousuiri11_kuro2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Can we start a rumour of how "Steel Man Kuro" came about?

I was about to say "but what about witnesses wouldn't anyone have seen someone kill not a real Nanase" and remembered the youkai and... oh yeah haha it's fiction lmao KOTOKO-CHAN GOT ME haha<br />P.P.S. "I heard that Terada-san wasn't a fan of big breasts" <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I'll leave this quote as is haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Not much this week considering nothing new came out. I just ended up giving more songs from <b>Humbreader's 1st album</b> and... well I did intend to listen to more indie artists I've given in the past few weeks but you know, I stopped after Thursday night. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><br />On news around the Internet mainly Twitter and beyond if ever, <b>vivid undress is releasing a new mini-album</b> in June because they can and boy are they fast, <b>miwa and her music videos so far are out on YouTube</b> because why not have views instead of profit so enjoy them I guess, <b>Kitou Akari's 1st album</b> will come in May, I will listen to <b>SpecialThanks' upcoming album in April</b> since their band reshuffle, <b>Waki Azumi's new music video</b> is obviously an old melody on hip pop style but that's not the point because Ajuju is dancing in it, I missed a couple of livestreams so let's not talk about it haha, and I see <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kitoakari_1016/status/1240890269311987713" target="_blank">Kitou Akari listens to the same songs as I am</a></b>, namely from Sakamoto Maaya's latest album "<a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BC%E3%83%AB/1487046413?i=1487046730&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Diesel</a>". That album ain't bad, you guys should listen to it.<br /><br />Next week probably SID's latest single will appear in review if all is according to plan, and... oh yeah, <b>FLOWER FLOWER's new album</b>. Yeah, I'll give a listen to that. I always just avoid them but seriously I'll just end up giving more than I expect which is none. "No expectations make of a good impression, yes?" If you're using my quote please put my Twitter handle on it haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is it then. To give a quick update because someone is killing himself for listening to me talk about Animal Crossing New Horizons already, I got lost in the "tutorial" for Day 1 because it lacked direction which of course promotes freedom, Day 2 was great because I get to leave the island to explore others but construction is such a drag, and Day 3 which is today... let's hope new villagers come tomorrow haha. Still WAAAY better progress than when I decided to replace by desk top and that DAMN F**KING GUY DOESN'T COME- I don't want to call customer service. Customer service is tiring I hate working as it and I hate being on the other end too, doesn't make me happier anyways. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... let's hope they appear today. Let's hope. I gotta stop now I'll pack up my desk so I can do the DIY stuff within half an hour and go shower haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
