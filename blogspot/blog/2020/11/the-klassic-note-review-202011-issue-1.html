<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2020.11 Issue 1</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RdNd4clgR_Q/X6qVqaiQkMI/AAAAAAAA_cM/ReYSdR5D6EInYuc44Fla6xa11Op67hgRACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PXL_20201110_115538783.jpg" /></div><div>  Yeah I thought of checking the package status this morning and I saw it preparing to ship   to my place by tonight. Yes, tonight is now, ladies and gentlemen. </div><div><br /></div><div>And also, to avoid getting too high about this and the fact I still have to sleep to   work the next couple more days lol, I'm splitting this up. I'll do up   the reviews first because those are easier technically maybe or not, but yeah,   I'd like to talk about music first if you all don't mind. Then, on Thursday   probably because tomorrow night SUCKS (lol) (yes work), we'll talk   about the rest of the package. </div><div><br /></div><div>  So, without further ado, let's talk about... to be honest, the most rewarding risk of a Klassic Note Review issue yet. Yeah, no joke. Well, music wasn't part of the risk haha lol</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div id="ORESAMAGimmme"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>音楽</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    ORESAMA - Gimmme! [Single]</div></blockquote><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img height="320" src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/13/43/LAPS-4000.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin: auto; user-select: none;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>  (Well, you just need to know that, just like their other releases, these are very   ORESAMA so read on to find out why) </div><div><br /></div><div>  Origin: Finally I get to talk about them in all their glory from indie to   major and how I've heard of them all these years. Everyone, meet ORESAMA, an indie   duo a long time coming. They started years ago as an indie group, with the guy writing   songs and Pon-san our dear female vocalist singing them. As you can hear for   yourself, they specialise in dance pop, not exactly a popular genre out there,   kind of niche, but they got recognition real fast. Also for an Anime theme   song for "Alice to Zouroku", they major debuted in 2017 with their 1st major   single, and that probably broke all the records they have so far and many years to come. For previously they were depicted through drawings and animations,   major debut allowed of them to grace their appearance in front of the camera, as they have been in one of the best music videos I've seen ever since, no joke.   Fast forward beyond their boom until after their 1st album which died down   real fast in Klassic Note, I still pop in from time to time to see if they   have any great songs to offer, and this one I can't miss. It's for Anime too,   but unlike the comedy series itself which is a joke, this is such a wonderful song for an   ending, it's almost unfitting for it. Let's talk about why. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Gimmme!</div><div>From first chorus:</div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Ah call it good night</div><div style="text-align: center;">To be amazed, (at the extent of) the brightness of this world</div><div style="text-align: center;">This bleak happiness, (I) see in (my) dreams"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div></div><div>  For being an Anime song, the lyrics easily fit into the theme real well, since   it's mostly about dreams and sleep. But it's more like having a good night in   the night club but you'd rather spend it in your bed, of sorts. The song   itself might be simple in melody, but it's catchy and easy to take in, so you   can't say anything bad about it once you get into it. As mentioned earlier, it   takes a lot to like this dance pop style, and if you can take it, the whole   package of this song is actually real good, to be honest, and might be their   best in a while. The music video is only going to make you like this song more and   especially, their vocalist Pon-san even more with all the cosplay and   fainting. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coC5HXXg1vg"></iframe></div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Quirky Pop Average)</div><div><br /></div><div>(2) Yakou no Ame [Rain of Night Stroll]</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Dear rain don't go, don't leave me alone and go</div><div style="text-align: center;">The scars that don't disappear and stir up (from time to time), again alone, (for the) rest of the night"</div></blockquote><div></div><div></div><div>  This, is definitely changing my impression of ORESAMA, for the better. My   typical impression of them is like of a dance club: happy, joyful, having a   great time, and they are entertaining us through music. But this, is one of   those sides of them you hardly will see, and that I think above all else, is   why I liked this song. Through it's slow beats and meaningful lyrics, this   truly represents the feels of being alone and sad in the rain, walking through   the night. This loneliness, I'm sure you have felt it if you tried staying up   late. Hallucinations begin to form, solitude becomes a necessity. I think just   walking down the feels of this tune, I can totally feel that running through   me. Don't try to put this on the next lo-fi pop radio YouTube video, I tell   you; They deserve more than that. I would argue though, that the quieter   moments of this song might be too quiet, as heard from the beginning and   bridge parts, which may or may not be a plus for this song. </div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Lonely Average)</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: I doubt we will ever see another perfect release like this one   from ORESAMA, but I trust they will deliver something better than this in   the future. Meanwhile, if no one has heard of them even outside of Anime theme   songs, be sure to support them and give them a listen if you like their style.   This style isn't everywhere in the Japanese music industry, and I think they make   of perfect fit for Anime. The major debut only made them shine further into   the light. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  Ooo boy am I going to scream from my bellows if I wait any longer for this next one SO!!! </div><div><br /></div><div>(Haha)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div id="ReinaLiterature"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>音楽</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> The Klassic Note Review</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    Ueda Reina - Literature [Single]</div></blockquote><table align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img class="mfp-img" height="317" src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/26/LACM-24028.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 969px;" width="320" />      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img class="mfp-img" height="317" src="https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/27/LACM-24029.jpg?v=1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 969px;" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Artist Edition<br />      </td>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Anime Edition<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div>  (I didn't have a choice the Artist's Edition had one more track which is as   good as none so I had to take the Anime Edition. I think we got over that   aesthetic   <a href="https://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-revolutionary-decision.html" target="_blank">back in 2014 already</a>  so don't mind Elaina if you don't know her) </div><div><br /></div><div>  Origin: Okay, about why we are even here in the first place. To be frank? I   don't even know much of Ueda Reina. You may think this is a joke, but if not   for the Anime, I wouldn't even give this a listen. But since we're here means   something happened between her and her other voice actress friends that have   made her voice sound so well, let her show off her singing more than anyone   else, and brought her appeal to me. I don't even know if this is her usual   style in her years of solo music, but I can tell you, this is   truly an impression on many levels. If you think she sounds like Hanazawa Kana   or Hondo Kaede, you're not alone. Let's see if we can find out more about what   her music career is with this release. </div><div><br /></div><div>(1) Literature</div><div></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Where are you going?</div><div style="text-align: center;">...Slightly far away</div><div style="text-align: center;">Leaving behind things (memories) for my dreams</div><div style="text-align: center;">Choosing what (I) like</div><div style="text-align: center;">Because (freedom of) choice is what will make of me"</div></blockquote><div></div><div></div><div>  It's an Anime theme song for a series I've been watching "Majou no Tabitabi",   and if I say the lyrics need a compatibility test because the lyricist   literally nailed this too well, I may still be underestimating my words. Every   corner of this song is a description of Elaina the main girl and the world   around her as she travels and doesn't say much about the things around her,   just enjoying travel, helping out others, and writing her fascinations in her   diary. The lyrics covered everything, I'm not even exaggerating. Kudos though,   to the music producer, a seasoned Anime producer who also packaged this song   that will make of impact, though swift and smooth, though soft and sweet. A   true example of the power of music in face of Anime, and I must say this is a very good attempt. I may have been harsh on the bridge for being too high on pitch   or off notes for some in the chorus when she sings, but maybe the melody is not fitting for   the singer herself. But if this is meant as a healing song, then it has done   it, with impact even, to the level of the music video too. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufLKDNlLrAQ"></iframe></div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Anime Standard Average)</div><div><br /></div><div>(2) Hana no Ame [Rain of Flowers]</div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Summer without you (I) feel slightly lonely</div><div style="text-align: center;">Passing through (days in) the long spring (I) will continue to sing</div><div style="text-align: center;">(I) will not lie Tu lala lila"</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div></div><div>  Yes, this was the one which blew my mind. Let's just say I've not heard of a   soothing melody all year, and this one threw me off my rails, and then some.   The lyrics ensure that I never forget the feels of seasons changing, and also, a cute and lonely girl's heart shouting out for company. Coupled with   Ueda Reina's soothing and soft voice, this might be too suitable of a song for   her. I would like to think the composer is also of such calibre writing in such a style, picturing the   music going along with Reina-chan feeling for her own written lyrics... Now you   know why my fear for giving this single went away as soon as they played nice   to me. All the way too, except maybe at the end not so much, as it could have   had a better ending. Still, this makes of a lovely song I would find once in a   while in mainstream, and I will never expect to find again unless Toyosaki Aki   came up with another single. Hey, she filled in that gap, what can I say. The   music video is a special project where they asked for fans to upload photos of   two-flower arrangements and it was patched into a music video sequence. </div><div style="text-align: center;">  <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkQ1yFawRUo"></iframe></div><div>Rating: 4 stars (Lovingly Above Average)</div><div><br /></div><div>  Conclusion: All in all, I came in from doubtful and just wanting to give the   Anime I watch its opening theme song, to now I think she is idolism material.   What can I say? I'm already too into it by now, just like how just two songs   can change my mind about voice actress Ueda Reina, and I think Reina-chan, I'm pleased to have met your acquaintance. Even if you have not heard of her, this   single brings about a soothing feel that one will not easily forget, so be   sure to immerse yourselves in a world of Anime... and flowers and Ueda Reina herself, why not.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note</div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. In case you didn't notice the irony of the opening quote ORESAMA did lose   to a voice actress in music haha Reina-chan...!! </div><div><br /></div><div>  [This Klassic Note Review is sponsored by Lantis Japan haha okay me (Now you   know why the joke above)] </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  Haha is this too passionate of a Review? Seriously man, really did not end up   believing they can be on my shelf. I guess I need to remember this feeling   again, huh. PACKAGE TIME!!! </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>THE PACKAGE</div><div>Yep, no unboxing, that's for the next post, don't worry. Meanwhile...</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img border="0" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RdNd4clgR_Q/X6qVqaiQkMI/AAAAAAAA_cM/ReYSdR5D6EInYuc44Fla6xa11Op67hgRACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PXL_20201110_115538783.jpg" width="320" /></div><div>  Let's talk about ORESAMA first and leave the best for last haha. It's not   much, it's just a simple package in this time so I'm not that surprised,   doesn't come with special gifts of any sort. I believe they want to keep a   lower profile on this release, but hey, I still liked it so I'm giving them   the support they need. And besides, I'm here for the music, really, not even   for the music video. That's Klassic Note worthy, understand? </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img border="0" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s2dS11Sph4Q/X6qVyaUe4AI/AAAAAAAA_cQ/8bzNZKBFn8gBYbrKE6DOAY5Ei-PN6TMngCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PXL_20201110_115912180.jpg" width="320" /></div><div>  On the other side in IdolismLand... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sorry man Ueda Reina gotta make   you look different than mainstream a bit. Yes, as you can see, I tried hard   for this time as soon as I realised I can give the Anime theme song AND the   B-side. Heck, I even had a choice to get which store I liked. So after some   thinking though of what special gifts to get for her seeing like, you know,   which one has her best image for me so that I'll remember her (longer), and   surprisingly this isn't the best thing that has happened. Yet. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">  <img border="0" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HPjW79KdRZE/X6qV2oX45LI/AAAAAAAA_cU/rDvAmM0JJ2g398CD9D262Zw-h8IBmHJSACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PXL_20201110_121054021.jpg" width="320" /></div><div>  Yes, if you have been following my Entertainment News posts and that Saturday   post, you should have noticed that, with this purchase I also obtained myself   a spot at the online signing event happening in about 2 weeks time. And I tell   you, it's my first. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Now you know what I'm fantasising right now lol   okay it's online, it's on Lantis' livestream website MixBox anyways, and I'm   just going to get an autograph (my first ever FYI) so let's not get too   excited about it until the day itself, yes? Haha so thanks <div class="popup"><span class="normal">Animate</span><span class="pop"><img border="0" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/201009_ueda_animate.jpg" /></span></div> for the   bromide photo and spending time to probably get it from another local store that still has stock and informing me through mail about the delay <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, and it's totally worth it that I chose this instead of the others from Lantis' official store <div class="popup"><span class="normal">A-on STORE</span><span class="pop"><img border="0" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/201009_ueda_A-on.jpg" /></span></div> to <div class="popup"><span class="normal">Gamers</span><span class="pop"><img border="0" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/201009_ueda_gamers.jpg" /></span></div> which is totally a contender if not for out of stock to maybe <div class="popup"><span class="normal">Rakuten</span><span class="pop"><img border="0" src="https://www.lantis.jp/_maintenance2/data/201009_ueda_rakuten.jpg" /></span></div> thank   goodness. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No, I totally did not even bother to read the news on her   artist site to know of that event, really. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>Okay turns out there is also a talk event I can participate in, but since that one application only came with the physical release, and despite the window being two weeks after release date... I had to wait for the rest of the package to come. Hey, international shipping fees be real ex at this time of year so... I gotta make compromises besides I can't type Japanese for sh*t- FYI if you really want to watch too I think it's for the public too, it's the 22nd this month, 2pm JST for the talk event and 4pm for the signing. I just... don't get the special bonus for not signing up that 2pm one, I guess.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  Man, have I not been more wrong on what I said the other night and put as   TL:DR; above haha because just like the USA election results, this, well,   these are as unbelievable of reviews we've talked about today. And I'm still   impressed today. I can tell you, this is the hype I've been waiting for,   whatever it is. This might really be what it feels to be giving music reviews   again, huh. I know, I have been slacking or even became strict in giving songs   over the years because you know, everyone is critical about music. I just   chose to like what I want. This is good example, and also a good Review. Maybe   next year we will get better ones; I can only be hopeful. Man, it's going to   be hard topping&nbsp; </div><div><br /></div><div>  TL:DR; ORESAMA is genuinely good and Ueda Reina is just idolism also not a   coincidence that people like to talk about rain in their song titles at this   time of year lol it's rainy season out there so take care of yourselves, okay?   I'm... trying to be a Ueda Reina lol </div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. I still hate Blogger till this date because if you noticed gaps between the photos and text it's me trying to cover up the fact that this website is making things look bad for my usual routine blog posts *sigh*</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
