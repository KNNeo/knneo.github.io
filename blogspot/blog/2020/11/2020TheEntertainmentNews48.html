I can get it anywhere in the world" No   ya b*tch you want the authentic stuff lol what do you know (no I'm not   going to shit on her in Chinese haha) </div>  </blockquote>  A princess from Ethiopia? Now where have I heard of that story before...   *laughs* Inspired by the past couple of episodes apparently Laurent why you   steal other people's ideas (lol), this new episode (#GREATPRETENDER20) I guess we're   going full on China again- Hey remember some people got sent down the ocean   floor after trying to save a bunch of kids out and now Laurent has to save all   of them? Hopefully you can recall what has happened so far because I can't even. So,   finally, we have the full backstory, all in one episode. God, that ending with   Makoto giving Laurent the wallet is so meta I can't even. *laughs* Okay,   let's talk story. Story from when we took a break since two weeks ago,   Dorothy's gang was about to do a final heist, but on to the Chinese mafia, and   the plan now is to abduct a descendant of the African nation, give it to them   for 10 million USD, and then save Dorothy out. Simple enough right? Yeah, and   if you don't think this is also deja vu because yes they did use it on the   Japanese mafia too but since they don't know about the story in China   technically we can recycle this approach lol. Hey, who says scams can't be   used more than once. *laughs* Moving on, Obviously there is a drop, because if you are   waiting for it like me and know that this heist failed, is that that very princess who was supposedly studying   in Japan or whatever, appeared in the papers. China papers, that's right. So   yeah, got found out I guess freaking OZ WHAT DO WE DO NOW haha. And so,   surprisingly, they did the similar approach to the Japanese mafia as we have   seen, sending them down to the ocean floor. I suppose that's how this time   around travelling back to present time, Cynthia and the others would have   survived since they likely have a contingency plan now. Because for Dorothy, they   didn't. Well, Oz did kind of draft up a last-minute plan to save them, but hey   dear girl, you really shouldn't have insulted the head of the Chinese mafia   haha. Like seriously, that's really what got her a bullet to the chest, she could have been saved. So yeah, that one's dead dead though. And as Laurent gets   sad about all this and them 10 million dollars flying past them as they try to   recover from their lives, including Oz having to sacrifice himself because   technically he was the middleman in the incident... by committing crime lol   wow Makoto's dad has got everything in his sleeve it seems. I guess his idea   was to use jail as a cover for himself lest Liu comes for him which I guess is   smart, and alternatively, as Laurent woke up from his dream of a Dorothy-less   life after leaving China... Yes Laurent left China. And never came back. Ever.   Yeah okay if you have watched this far you know that's not true but still. He   wrote a tender note to Oz, asking for a revenge plan against the Chinese   mafia, for Dorothy. I mean, it's for revenge and she did say not to do it so   whatever haha. Then again, we haven't actually got the 10 million yet so I guess. And   to the ending, we got the storytelling on various parts where all the other   members have been found. They are namely why Cynthia isn't the big boss here   but she's got big boobs and that's how she got hired by trying to scam Laurent   I guess haha (which I assume after her breakup with Thomas), Abbie who got found   on the streets dealing with thugs good one (and yes we need a Dorothy   replacement, but as in figure only), Oz went back to the Chinese mafia to   plead for guilty because Laurent asked him too technically (and of course,   kept mum about it from the kid and even still visiting the mother until her death in   silence), and Makoto joined because just watch Episode 1 haha. To conclude,   that's a lot of info to absorb, but we'll talk about likely happenings after   this week. Firstly, the fates of all the people involved in this heist. Now we   know how Laurent can come back to visit Liu. Because, as he has not stabbed   the dude and told him his mother in France is almost dead lol (Didn't he leave   her alone I think? Watch back I forgot), he can technically "go back" to Liu   because he was still one of his underlings at some point, helping him as a   translator. So yes, as I said before, it's probably a favour out here, and   that will save all their butts I think. What specifically though, we   shall see to know. Then, how the history ties everyone up together. So, "confidence man" here has been holding on to the same philosophy for years on,   that is, to scam the rich and not kill, out of anything goes I guess. From   Dorothy being head to now Laurent, even without Oz on the hand (or maybe he's   behind all along which will explain how Laurent isn't that smart lol) the team   still kind of is able to pull things together. Again, don't ask Cynthia to do   the seducing thing we know it doesn't work in some cases lmao. And lastly, how   it all stands now. I'm going to watch closely on the episode timeline here,   trying to follow TV simulcast here like most Anime do even nowadays (F**k   Netflix okay?? Thanks for the videos anyways lol), but yeah, moving on I think   we will see how this arc gets concluded. Yes, there will be a season two in   place apparently, but we gotta see this off right? And we shall. Cya guys next   week. </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-neIoUouGRYE/X8N-9bhl3qI/AAAAAAAA_3c/M4iUMacAwz4FznEEtsL5DhlgN5za6ygjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender20_dorothy5.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      That is a confident woman who knows she cannot deal with a   cockroach lol<br /> </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rIYkiH69vtw/X8N_QL6dNoI/AAAAAAAA_3k/N7mBE-p_HAAvh_mxzzK3jHCESwWOYFFCwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/greatpretender20_cynthia1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      That is a confident woman who knows she can cheat money out of   rich guys<br />(haha)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div></div><div>  P.S. *sees Laurent stab Liu* AWWWW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOOODDD!!! Dammit   why past Laurent why "We never kill." Well said, Shi Ohn, well said. </div><div>  P.P.S. I think we're on par now, and looking at the preview for the last part   for this season on their official Twitter... I think we only get to see Makoto   say "we've come here to say our goodbyes" and stabbing someone haha I hope no   one's dead remember we don't kill here </div><div>  [Just my own words here: But yes the flashback does seem weak in convincing us   about Dorothy's death because look how successful the first three arcs turned   out. Really brought down the endings for the flashback as Laurent cries over her   death because yeah, I don't even know if she's dead or not at that point, like seriously.   Hard to trust that now you've seen so much tbh the Anime didn't take some time   to play down the power of success in their heists enough to give this arc   impact] </div><div><br /></div><div>  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="MajoTabi09">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Majou no Tabitabi</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "I need to make money somehow, huh." I can see Saya smiling from end on   end already haha Elaina let's not try the Association shall we? *laughs* </div>  </blockquote>  Wow with that adult content warning in the intro it took you this long to tell   us that, huh. *laughs* In this unhealthy new episode because it must be the sausages   on screen lmao (#MajoTabi09), I think the flyer is a job offer for being a   "confidence man" lol hey someone's going to get duped with this loli magician   as a potential hire amirite Laurent?? *laughs* Moving on from that lie of a   series haha, yes Elaina needs to earn some money otherwise just like the adult   content warning up front we might have to see her earn money using her body-   Okay thank goodness it's a fellow magician. Oh yeah, and spoiler alert? The   supposed "adult content" here is not sex. I promise you. *laughs* It's blood.   You'll get what I mean in a while. *pukes* Okay, story time, *laughs* Wow,   they even skipped the opening and removed animation for the ending lol. (*they can't credit rated content is what they meant*) So,   story goes that Elaina run out of funds, surprisingly way longer than how Saya   can hold out which I also don't assume they left house with the same starting   funds, but you know, no surprise because it's going to happen someday. Haha imagine if it happened   when she meets Saya again that'll be a problem lol. Thankfully, she found a   flyer who will give her money. Like, for work. The premise is simple: It's from a Lavender Witch, she wants to travel back in time to save her childhood   friend, and she needs somebody to accompany her. I mean, what could go wrong,   amirite?? But considering the series, we shouldn't be too optimistic but at   least we know Elaina won't die from this haha serious foreshadowing her also   spoilers if you read this far. Anyways, the witch was prepared, the plan is to   go back a decade and save the parents from being killed which   <strike>Estella</strike> Estelle here thinks, is the source of her friend   Selena being a murderer after she moved in with her uncle. Ugh, I feel bad   telling this story again. Hey, welcome to this #Minikui series man, been a   while since we used that word we have been getting lovely stories the past few   weeks lol. Moving on, the plan worked, they travelled back to what the city   was 10 years ago, and despite Elaina's concerns about time manipulation   affecting the current present they live in... okay so you can't save the   present then ok ok haha thank goodness this Anime still has some logic lol I   mean, look at those time-travelling Anime out there and tell me which one of   them made sense. *laughs* ANYWAYS (haha) (this won't make much sense too so)   Estelle managed to get her bestie's parents out of their house so the killer would   appear and stab nobody because... it didn't appear. Oh? Logical loophole here?   And as Elaina waited not for long since they only had an hour to do this, she   then found out that her magic has been drained, so she knows the Lavender   Witch is in trouble. Okay I may have exaggerated thinking that the murderer   may have known of magic because maybe that's why the parents' death may be   inevitable nonetheless, but hey, you forgot there's someone else in this   specific household besides the parents who can kill the parents. Yes, it's her. It's Selena. Ugh.   *laughs* So yes, to fill us in on the blanks and probably Estelle herself, the   abuse has happened before Selena moved in with the uncle. The dad's a rapist   (ugh), and the mother's a bitc- So she killed them. Yes, as a 10-year-old.   Again, as I've watched Anime series like "Babylon" and "Kara no Kyoukai", if   you kill people as a kid you're fucked up, no matter what the reason. I mean,   leaving and living on the edge would have been a better option. So, Selena got   found out, and Estelle, with the last of her breath and magic even without   Elaina's magic as she took the ring off (I saw that from a mile away tbh, that   her magic would be used for Estelle out of her will) (I mean, you wouldn't   think? Or else how you get the fat pay check that she didn't keep), killed her   "best friend" once again, as she did counting from current present, 3 years   ago. Hey, I'm getting so much deja vu I'll need a heater to warm me up later   from this episode. In the end, Estelle sacrificed her 10 years of memories   with Selena I assume, to kill her. Hey, and all is well lol why are you crying   Elaina but seriously though, as much as this is hard to watch, it's also   pretty revolting. And it's not because of the blood, trust me you haven't   watched much Anime yet if you think this freaks you out lol I'm not a murderer.   *laughs* Still, pretty impressed the Anime will go that far to do this type of   content to be honest. I thought the past 8 episodes is what they have to offer,   and we'll probably get more "This and That Village" stories instead lol. I'll   say for one thing though for this episode: Estelle did do what was needed to   save herself, that's more important. Because seriously, you wouldn't want to   remember what dumb things you did just so you can gain nothing out of it haha   that's literally for all the characters in this series other than maybe Elaina   and Fran haha bye </div><div>  [I thought I could get over this year in Anime without seeing gore but, uh, I   guess not now xD] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H6qkvQ38T5E/X8OANCj9WHI/AAAAAAAA_38/b55lFgin4VA5XwBuqZ5TwUiJvqb463r0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majotabi09_hug1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Seeing this hug is as sad as it is also a huge joke, really.<br /> </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qEgo-Dm2_tY/X8OAN-olJzI/AAAAAAAA_4A/Tj0oKaqOtWAF3_JYWh6IRsoBROnRJR9DwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/majotabi09_hug2.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Seeing this hug is as sad as it is also a huge joke, really.  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. "Are you making fun of me?" And THAT is how you do a job interview haha   you can leave now Elaina-san lmao but seriously though don't do this "And   what's the payment?" Yeah also not this haha imagine you try to waltz into an   interview doing these ugh you will not last long<br />P.P.S. "The magic I   created to go back in time was not simple. It wasn't something I could make   without sacrificing something" Well no shit dude I think we've heard this many   times, like when someone lost her voice for a sword without lies remember that   stupid thing? lol oh yeah memories too to make your dad a dragon </div><div>  [TL:DR; I guess magic doesn't hurt lol how much does it take to kill someone   with it man?? I thought magic should be able to kill people cleanly or   painlessly I wonder how Estelle did it to Selena 3 years ago lmao] </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uXxtS73qdOw/X8N_kyda_WI/AAAAAAAA_3s/jLCTQGTURmEYkXj-ekKofc3bzbS_8PjnwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/majotabi09_shock.gif" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Me when I got my first pay check haha I shocked how much goes to     CPF<br />   </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i4d-_e32Trs/X8OAJvHgBLI/AAAAAAAA_34/_SdP_EJPEoA6VcHeYoGUSGC3PYrBYd2cwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/majotabi09_money.gif" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Well that's a very materialistic Elaina right there haha<br />(Prospective     bachelors I hope your pockets are deep)    </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div></div> <div><br /></div><div>  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ToniKawa09">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tonikaku Kawaii</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "...like the way he worries about people more than the home that burned   down" Well in his defence he did do his contingency plan so his data   should be fine but that brand new TV man... *laughs* </div>  </blockquote>  Well Tsukasa, if I were him I would also not have worried about even if I have   my mansion burnt down because money is not hidden under my bed and... if I   have a wife man... That's more than enough. *laughs* In this new episode where we have to get our new   house ASAP now lol (#ToniKawa09) yeah where else can we go to now? Of course it's the bathhouse where else haha oh boy I want that truth dropped on that sister so bad lmao   remember that episode?? *laughs* Okay, ignoring that, they have to make   arrangements now, for their future accommodation. And while Nasa-kun is   thinking about   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ichaicha" target="_blank">ichaicha</a> with   his wife for at least a week in a (not love) hotel lmao, I guess we have a new   place to stay for now, ignoring real estate complications. We've got a lot (of   jokes) to cover this episode so let's do it! Firstly, about accommodation. The   obvious choice is of course in the bathhouse with the family who Nasa-kun   literally saved when they were in a pinch, so yeah, this much is little to pay   for, so you're welcome Nasa-kun. Helping each other out man, that's called   insurance. Seriously, cheaper than actual insurance companies lol. And   everyone in the house agreed to it too, including, and yes you should've seen   it coming, Aya-chan, who we know of, likes the dude so you would wonder why   she hasn't known of the marriage yet. Well we haven't been covering it so far up   till now anyways too so... *laughs* And so, we have to deal with this Aya-chan who has a   processor of like an   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron" target="_blank">Intel Celeron</a>  from early 2000s so *laughs* God, this is so dumb I can't wait for the day   they have to tell her the truth. The wholesome truth- Ah. *laughs* Man, the   mother with the drop from the top of the atmosphere to her daughter's head.   And dude, the future predictions too? Mom, can you not be smarter than the   author?? *laughs* Aw this series is just amazing thanks author. And so, we gotta   wrap things up eventually here, and man I wished we had a complete flashback but I   know Anime production or the author himself knows it's funnier to not, so welp   I guess Aya. You not main girl anyways TALKING ABOUT MAIN GIRL!! *laughs*   (Also, the shitting on the mom also is good haha if you can remember the   father left the house for the bathhouse's hired idol lmao) Then, we talk about   laundry. And yes, when you wife asks you to not bring it to the nearest   laundromat, there is a reason that... I say you should know. Yes, something   others shouldn't feast their eyes on. *laughs* Well, so long as it's not a   thong or it's wet we're good. *laughs* And of course, Tsukasa is totally right   because like most girls, they wouldn't want to see men in their house with   their underwear. Funny how as males why we don't care though lol. Anyways, she   washed <i>everything</i> so Nasa-kun is also thinking about everything lmao   can you stop. *laughs* At this point, I would say, is the time to protect, uh,   I mean, protecc. *laughs* Also why does she look fat- MOVING ON!! *laughs*   (Yeah start counting how many times I laughed because watching it first round   I lost count) And also, Kaname suggested to go shopping with her because you   know, some of them got burnt up. In the fire, in the fire. *laughs* Ironic why   Nasa-kun doesn't have to buy clothing but hey, who gives a shit about the guy.   *laughs* And so lastly, we talk about shopping for clothes. For a woman. Yes,   if you need life lessons now is a good time to listen up haha and I don't even   have a wife. *laughs* Man, someday I would like to do that too, for any woman.   *laughs* My life aside, let me drop a little truth on you guys. Firstly, the   price. Yes, Tsukasa wasn't joking. And Harajuku is your local famous shopping   district, in my case Orchard Road if it wasn't filled with Filipino maids now   lol. Ignoring them, the clothes girls buy are not cheap. Trust me, don't shop   with your mom for a while and you'll notice. Also, follow Instagram girls.   *laughs* (Really, there are fans who will research on what voice actresses   wear on camera, no joke) Because clothing is expensive, thankfully they are   also of real good quality, so at least you don't have to worry about using   them for long. I've tried myself out on clothing which are higher priced, and   can confirm, and I'm sure you realised that too, if you have the ability to   spoil yourself on clothing, and underwear of course. Sadly, this is where the   happy stuff ends, because for women to have satisfaction over variety of   clothing unlike guys (Tsukasa is a rare exception who can understand the   situation but) girls gonna need a lot of clothing for switching it around when   going outdoors. My mom be a great example because she has a mini wardrobe that   is not ours in every single bedroom in the apartment. *laughs* Including the   bathrooms. *laughs* Anyways, the embarrassment is top tier (lol), Nasa-kun is   totally sick in the mind turns out, and Kaname be MVP every episode she   appears because no one does   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a>  better than her already in this series. Well, she's the only one that isn't   f**ked up so *laughs* Stay tuned for more laughs in upcoming episodes. Man,   this series is the best so far no sad stories so feel bad or puke about lol </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NV2qGMueVRQ/X8OC4LcY3sI/AAAAAAAA_4o/1eZQIKxP-8IRMThPhULGDMqi0rQK00OPwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tonikawa09_youtuber.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Okay if it's    <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/179344/Aya_Arisugawa" target="_blank">Uesaka Sumire</a>      as a game-streaming YouTuber (with the cosplay)&nbsp;<strike>it'll definitely work</strike>      I'll watch the shit out of it lmao  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sE6E7KVoZeA/X8OC3GtE8PI/AAAAAAAA_4k/xP-GFz0HJ-A20VZCNe4WXoCBVz4a64CkACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tonikawa09_equation.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Wow no shit Aya-chan I can't even solve this properly at high   school lol this joker can do it in elementary school?? wtf  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

I also took some time (as in just now lol) to   give some chance to <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9A-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0-ep/1540734378?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Liyuu's 2nd single</b></a> where she debuted this year, and   uh, I kept being reminded of Chinese songs and those suck so *laughs* Well,   I'm not in the mood to give technopop anyways so you're not welcome.<br />  <br />In news concerning Twitter and music mostly because there is a lot to   talk about this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1331221144595140608?s=20" target="_blank"><b>cinema staff's new song</b></a> is a serious meh so I'm   not giving until they have a full on release,   <a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1330798247737167873?s=20" target="_blank"><b>SID's new music videos</b></a> are likely setup to (1) their new single   releasing end of December which I'll listen because the MV ain't bad and (2)   their upcoming 17th anniversary live early next year so I hope you guys have   money to give them lol (also I should follow them on Twitter haha why haven't   I), <a href="https://twitter.com/Scenarioart/status/1332971064800862208?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Scenarioart's YouTube live</b></a> from physical event the last of this   year is acoustic and it's great and in and because I don't want to live with   regrets and unlike VELTPUNCH's live I can donate in yen with a better exchange   rate" I gave them some money because independent labels be hard to live with   now, <a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1332295108394319872?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Aimer announced her new album</b></a> releasing April 2021 following her online   live, <a href="https://twitter.com/fuchigami_staff/status/1331211033508073474?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Fuchigami Mai's new music video</b></a> is great if I liked the song lol   (that's idolism in a nutshell), and   <a href="https://twitter.com/PHONOTONES/status/1332158787457744897?s=20" target="_blank"><b>PHONO TONES' 1st mini-album is finally on streaming services</b></a> haha   seriously though that was my 2012 year end fuel. In news not concerning music   but on Twitter still, <a href="https://twitter.com/kyokou_suiri/status/1332157196541579265?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Anime "Kyokou Suiri" announced a second season</b></a>.   Yay. I can see the joy in the dude's eyes already lol that face but seriously   though yay for more Kotoko-chan and b*tchy drama haha the mystery-solving is   not even important anymore </div><div><br /></div><div>  So for next week, well next month, looks like we have all lined up fresh new   releases for the month of December, one release every week haha good I thought   we're done. So first up next week is <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> for her   5th anniversary and I've said the topic song ain't bad anyways, followed by   yanaginagi's new album which previews aren't that bad I can identify a couple   of new hits I'd like, followed by Polkadot Stingray's new album since their   slew of digital singles and mini-album since start of the year, and SID's new   single will end the year in Klassic Note. Ugh, I still haven't came up with a   good list for everything yet haha I should get to it </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Ooo now that I'm worried about what ending to write, I saw Twitter just now and saw Earphones online show that I've watched (last week) <a href="https://twitter.com/earphone_seiyu/status/1332972667872321536" target="_blank">selling live bromides</a> starting tomorrow? Hey, why not. Haha it's not going to have pink somehow lmao. Good, now that I have an ending to my boring weeks now lol cya guys next week, and until next time... Capitalism will keep me going haha I'm going to attempt again migrating this blog with all the posts we have so far updated to the new elements respectively. Yeah, that'll take a lot of testing but it's a lot like what I've done at work so far with system migration so I'll deal with it time is the issue here probably will be good by next year maybe haha bye<br />  </div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
