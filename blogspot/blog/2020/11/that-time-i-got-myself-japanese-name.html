<h2 class="title">That Time I Got Myself A Japanese Name</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZG5-HBXPcs/X6aVLMiTz2I/AAAAAAAA_V8/3C_uM7FGNLo9_c_xV0EBh01yPZhMTq3LACLcBGAsYHQ/w344-h400/PXL_20201107_114521851.jpg" /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Hey, a rare post of me not talking about anything besides Anime and new   packages incoming at this time of year... but this one I think should be worth   talking about. In view of the next exposure of this unbecoming name (lol) to   the world, I shall spend some time here to talk about how, the one time, I had   given myself a Japanese name. I sure did not just randomize a name, I promise   you, for besides being used for more practical purposes ie. online shopping   today, it had its origins, and since I've been interested in the Japanese...   Anime subculture I feel like I should talk more about it. So, without further   ado and not spoiling more so I can tell a story, let's begin.<br /><br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">THE ORIGIN STORY OF JAPANESE ME</div><div style="text-align: left;">  So, about how all this thought of giving myself a name all begin. Back then, I   started watching Anime mainly because of <b>"BLEACH"</b>, of course... at   this point, 20-year-old action series which my middle school friend hooked me   in to watch, and after reading a couple of chapters of the manga he brought   into school (it's not Japan so it was fine haha we read it on breaks in   between lessons anyways), I went ahead to watch the Anime, then still airing   the Arrancar Arc, if I wasn't wrong. That was 2007. So firstly, because of   being as cool as the characters in the series, you would like to give a name   to yourself, but even back then thinking of ideas of zanpakutos and kido and   maybe a real cool role for my name... (yes haha) (for future self that is 5   swords supposedly "stolen" from the guy who created them I think Namaiya, over two dozen   spells of some are simple level binding spells inspired by tying my shoelaces,   and the replacement captain and 4th seat after Urahara betrayed Soul Society)   (haha I have been wanting to say that so I'm sorry I AM a BLEACH nerd hehe)   but even then I didn't go that far as to give a name to any characters I   created or whatever (I'm not Mayuri, man), but BLEACH talk over for now, I   didn't want to use any of their names because most of the good guys get   trashed anyways inheriting their family name feels like ridicule for me or   something like that, maybe not cool enough haha. Whatever the reason though,   it was mixed, there wasn't a goal, and I was just only thinking. But THEN, as   I continued into the world of Anime still being like, an emo kid at 15 years   old (ugh) (haha), I watched another series which changed my decision. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Thus, secondly, came Anime movie series <b>"Kara no Kyoukai"</b> (also known   as Garden of Sinners), and if you don't agree with me that the 5th movie is   the coolest, and Aozaki Touko - an expert magician fighting against   whatever bad guys there are (oh yeah that magician who thought he was God and   didn't believe Shiki had super death eyes haha) - being the coolest character   in the movie itself not to even say the series (screw you Ryougi Shiki haha), then   you can leave now I don't even care. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> And as you can see very soon,   that is EXACTLY how I got the first part of the name nailed in the coffin. For   modelling an excellent mind of scheming character, I gotta take my family name   from the Aozakis, no doubt. (Sorry Urahara Kisuke lol) </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Haha what am I saying here lol it's totally true though. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  And so, motivated by this family name, I went out to then research properly, a   given name that would suit me at first sight. And I chose a fairly common one,   but not one I've seen around before in my... limited exposure to Japanese   culture even today, "Shouhei", for peace and smooth-sailing, amongst other   things that make of me now to be honest. So there you go, put them together   just as how the Japanese would have wanted: </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i>"Aozaki Shouhei"</i></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  You won't need the Japanese spelling I'll show you examples later haha also pronounced as "a-o-za-ki show-hey" just in case you can't read this out lol</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">WHERE HE APPEARS TODAY</div><div style="text-align: left;">  And thus, with the name born, it was left there for many years to come, until   I found the first use of this name which came in around end 2013, where I   learnt of buying CDs DIRECTLY from Japan's online stores and through   forwarding services like the long time running partner of the Klassic Note   Review series (lol) Tenso.com, I had to fill in personal particulars, yes hear me   out, in Japanese. And so, I didn't have to come up with a fake name or   nothing; I already had one ready. And so, I picked up the guts to try the   service by signing up and trying to understand the terms and   conditions of service on the same level as I normally would on my local online   shopping sites which is just skip them all (haha), and I had to use a Japanese   shipping address and translate myself a Katakana name, as that is how those   sites learn of how to pronounce your name in case if can't be read using   purely Hiragana, I would assume. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5yR4T49YUfw/X6aRtgCOD_I/AAAAAAAA_U8/LFPQpJe5uaQqhnGgZd0tHR0ZNLpu17dhACLcBGAsYHQ/s843/animate-acct-register.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="278" data-original-width="843" height="133" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5yR4T49YUfw/X6aRtgCOD_I/AAAAAAAA_U8/LFPQpJe5uaQqhnGgZd0tHR0ZNLpu17dhACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h133/animate-acct-register.jpg" width="400" /></a>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Courtesy of Animate Online Japan, with own translations in English<br />(Well,         they do have an English site now so...)       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z9cfprdvz-c/X6aR-Yi_pCI/AAAAAAAA_VE/rTNmVkgaGp8qgEPnVhB8WQYlF9fgRjDJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/PXL_20201107_114728295.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1698" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z9cfprdvz-c/X6aR-Yi_pCI/AAAAAAAA_VE/rTNmVkgaGp8qgEPnVhB8WQYlF9fgRjDJgCLcBGAsYHQ/w331-h400/PXL_20201107_114728295.jpg" width="331" /></a>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        As you can see, receipts even just from my previous packages had my         "name" written all over it<br />      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">  Today,   <b>I use this name seemingly for anything and everything before the forwarding     service</b>, because besides that one, I don't have to use my real name and home   address, I can just come up with one. Meaningful, none the less, and it wasn't   even a joke. This name has indeed represented my identity in Japan, so much so   I took pride in using this name. And thus even today I use for any online   alias I would have to use, from online services to online profiles, including   LINE, Twitter and even recently too, Instagram. Don't try to add me as a   friend on Instagram because as written on my profile "I created this account for the   purpose of following female voice actresses *Please do not follow me" lmao </div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8qoGxHEWRTg/X6aTqICSHyI/AAAAAAAA_Vk/D0XXAS2cjKAJ7FZPJaIGv9weXr3VqBjiQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1806/Screenshot_20201107-202614.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1806" data-original-width="1080" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8qoGxHEWRTg/X6aTqICSHyI/AAAAAAAA_Vk/D0XXAS2cjKAJ7FZPJaIGv9weXr3VqBjiQCLcBGAsYHQ/w239-h400/Screenshot_20201107-202614.png" /></a>      </td>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGYDh8RQzL0/X6aTq-0SWiI/AAAAAAAA_Vo/VoF6knsbp0E6nJ4diDz5t9WeJJhP54OFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1806/Screenshot_20201107-202604.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1806" data-original-width="1080" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGYDh8RQzL0/X6aTq-0SWiI/AAAAAAAA_Vo/VoF6knsbp0E6nJ4diDz5t9WeJJhP54OFQCLcBGAsYHQ/w239-h400/Screenshot_20201107-202604.png" /></a>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">So, for archiving purposes, here are the front pages of my public social   media accounts as of 2020 hehe<br />(Yes I don't post anything on Insta because hey I mentioned it on my profile   description)</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">WHO KNOWS OF HIM</div><div>  One would consider the above cases all indirect contact information, because   honestly saying, I did not walk out to the streets of Japan and when people   ask me who I am I replied "Aozaki Shouhei" haha no no, I did not do that at   all. Then again it's probably also because I've never (yet) gone to Japan (the   world is burning now so definitely not now) but also because, I've never   really used that name for such a purpose, to interact with anything besides you   know, creating online shopping accounts haha. So yeah, but I did get my name   out for some to know, and so far, I think personally, only Tachibana Haru who   I have followed and bought some of her merch back in 2018, yes,   <b>Futon-chan should know of my name</b> because being a doujin   label, she had to mail all the goods out herself, including - may I show you -   writing the recipients' names in ink. Yes, I still have that envelope with her   own handwriting haha I'm such a creep it's not even an autograph </div><div>  <div></div>  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZG5-HBXPcs/X6aVLMiTz2I/AAAAAAAA_V8/3C_uM7FGNLo9_c_xV0EBh01yPZhMTq3LACLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/PXL_20201107_114521851.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1760" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZG5-HBXPcs/X6aVLMiTz2I/AAAAAAAA_V8/3C_uM7FGNLo9_c_xV0EBh01yPZhMTq3LACLcBGAsYHQ/w344-h400/PXL_20201107_114521851.jpg" width="344" /></a>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">          You have no idea how secretly proud I was seeing this in writing,           really.<br />It transcends the naming of a newborn baby names I tell           you.

It is because, the next full on use of this name unless people thinks this     really belongs to a Japanese (lol they would be wrong), it will be used on the upcoming <b>Ueda Reina's online signing event</b>. Yes, against all     odds (lol I don't even... like... her) I signed up for it. I'll be watching     it for sure, 2 weeks from now, and that shall really show how far I have     came to come up with such a wonderful name without even trying. Thanks,     Aozaki Shouhei, you have made me so proud, I'm prouder of you then of my     real name haha bye   </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.S. Tell me how cool my Japanese name is on my Twitter 'cos I would LOVE to     hear some praises lol I'm like Elaina from "MajoTabi"   </div></div><hr><h4>#The Everyday Life</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
