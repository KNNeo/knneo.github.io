<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note Review 2015.11 Issue 01</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
Well this one came like, another week again, so let's get to it. This time round, I'm not alone. Well, in terms of listening to the CD of course. This review is still purely my grey matter.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Ikimonogakari - Love to Peace!/Mudai ~Tooku e~ [Single]<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/20/ESCL-4543.jpg?v=1" style="max-height: 979px;" width="320" /></div>(The close-ups, are awesome. Ikimono at their best, in image.)<br /><br /><br />Origin: Should I have to? We're welcome again with one of the forefather artists in Klassic Note, and this trio has been together for... less than how long Klassic Note has existed. 16 years into their formation, this is their 2nd single this year, and a double A-side (to not forget the other composer; we'll talk about this later) too, in preparation of the recent announcement for their 2nd best compilation next year in March. Anticipating that, I am happy for another release, and that it is on my shelf once again, and they truly have the generic pop taste that will satisfy many. Let's talk about it.<br /><br />(1) Love to Peace! [Love And Peace]<br />As I said, this is not the first song that exhibited the title in the song (Hint: Sambomaster), not contrary to that it's not like that. We're greeted with another familiar tune similar to Mizuno, one of the two &nbsp;guys who writes songs within the group. This lively melody brings up a lot more than love and peace, as if you watched the music video it's like a train wreck in a wedding dinner, with them singing the song inside of it, so that's rather weird. The video aside, this song is nice to hear, and after hearing such a style many times I'm fine with it. It may not to you, but this retro-modern pop feel sure makes of a good song to dance to.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Mudai ~Tooku e~ [Dream ~Far Away~]<br />Okay, I have no idea about Kanji, so don't blame me for the translation. It's about dreams in the lyrics, apparently, so I'll take it as that. This one, obviously, is done by Hotaka, the other composer guy in the group who specialises (seriously) in writing touching and emotional songs, and this is no exception. Standing in between touching and emotional, this motivational song asks us to pursue our dreams, and this is indeed a song that I want at this time of the year, clearly. Anyways, this one definitely is a listen even if you're not a fan, because I like it. Purely because of this reason I listen to these people.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall a decent single, and I have no complaints. If you aren't a fan by now, what the hell is wrong with you? Go get a listen, and tell me what's bad about it. &nbsp;If you're complaining about their style, you clearly haven't been listening to their other songs which are great. This may not be, but their career is. Don't take my word for it as usual, go give it a listen.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />As usual the package comes with the first press Ikimono card, and I don't have to find it from the Internet like last time lol<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ybf_54DiRK8/VkCU7_rxQ5I/AAAAAAAASL4/UmHDEFAleGA/s320/IMG_20151109_195420.jpg" width="320" /></div>This one is simple, but their close-ups will make me happy, so I'm glad I got another one of their singles again. I'm sooo ready for their best album now.<br /><br /><br />This is it, I guess. Simple, but then it means a lot. I have no point to do up everything all over again and write long reviews, so this one doesn't feel that long, at least from my point of view. Cya guys later, I guess? Yeah, I talked about a music video review from yesterday, right? We shall see if I can get it done today.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
