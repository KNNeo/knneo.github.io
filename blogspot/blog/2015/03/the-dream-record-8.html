<h2>The Dream Record #8</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Again <b>I've dreamt of someone I know. This time it's </b><b>Horie</b><b> </b><b>Yui</b><b>,</b> or "Hocchan"if I didn't get her nickname wrongly.<br></p><p dir="ltr">She was like, sitting on a chair in my house's dining room, and I know specifically where, the one closest to the front door. I was standing behind her against the wall, like a bodyguard. She was not facing me, until someone said:</p><p dir="ltr">"You don't want anything from her?"</p><p dir="ltr">I'm like, what? And don't worry, none of the rated stuff, because she's a little old for me (just Google it) and she's an idol than... anything else to me. Nothing much comes through my mind, besides... autographs.</p><p dir="ltr">I rushed to my room where my shelves reside and try to find the few singles I have of her name and.. it's all in a mess. It was as if someone shook off the screws inside that support the wooden planks inside holding all the CDs. I started shuffling through the deck, trying to find out which year the discs are at, and it took some time.</p><p dir="ltr">I know I shouldn't make her wait, but as the minutes pass by and I haven't got all of them even I'm getting worried. Finally I got all two of them (clearly I forgot another one from the early years of Klassic Note) and got a marker I had on the shelf and let her sign them. Despite having to wait, she still gave me the smile as she happily did the deed. As I passed them to her I also noticed parts of the CD packaging (you know the cover that is outside the disc that conceals the left of the jewel CD case?) on my hands...<br></p><p dir="ltr">That is all, I guess. Not too long, not too short, but nonetheless she joins the list of idols I had in my dreams. I know getting her to sign the discs isn't difficult; she's been in multiple AFAs here the past few years. But the sitting-at-the-dining-room-chair-at-my-home thing is new.</p><p dir="ltr">I wonder who's next. Hopefully they're well dressed... Oh yeah you can bet that Hocchan is definitely well dressed...</p><hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
