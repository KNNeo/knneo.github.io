<h2>The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #33</h2>
"My brain's been stagnating. It needs this time of circumstances to get it going." -Kaineng, 2015<br /><br />I really didn't expect to say this myself. Serious.<br />(BTW that's adapted from a British sitcom 'Allo! 'Allo!, just to not violate copyright infringements or whatsoever)<br /><br />Well school has started, so from next week I'm going to get busy. But I suppose it won't stop me watching shows anyway, really. Look at the list below. I think I'm getting hyped for no reason. *wink*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sore ga Seiyuu!: </b>(1) F***KING DRAMA! Yeah who would have known, really. Stealing roles. (2) Guest is Kugimiya Rie, and I bet if I show this to my friend he'll start watching this show lol (3) The production are assholes, but as Futaba's senior said this is rather inevitable. Whether it's production being jerks or they changed it or they want to push someone to fame using this show (a very good example I know is Denki-gai no Honya-san, where a "Futaba" is pushed aside and replaced by Ayachi, who also did the opening theme song for the show, her first Anime single cameo) and so on, you'll know that someone must be behind this. And instead of searching for the truth, letting it go is part of the work. Reality is harsh, but this show is some level of drama. (4) The ending theme song (and I don't know why they don't sing in it, also do up a music video) rocks. Compare that to the 2nd single which just want me to give because they are theme songs. <a href="http://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-klassic-note-review-201507-issue-3.html" target="_blank">Here's the evidence</a> for their first single, released... two months before August. It's already out, the "3D" seiyuu version. I'm a voice actor fan guy.<br /><b>WORKING!!!:</b> *sob*<br /><br />...<br /><br />*sob*<br /><br />(Audience: SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE YAMADA'S MOTHER???) Haha, I guess so. But then that was hell of an episode. 2x reunion isn't an everyday thing in this show, let alone say probably the two most important ones (romance are counted as reunions too, you know) in this story up till now. We're introduced with Yamada's mother, who apparently is not mute but is so bad with words she rather not say it. (Now I wish I was her, but life would be tough, seriously) Also kudos to the author for linking Yamada's story with Haruna, that wife Otoo keeps missing her by but (for now) has found her once again. Man there's so much to talk about it, but now I'm in tears. If you aren't then buzz off; this show isn't for you, you heartless freak.<br /><br />Recently I'm bored, so there isn't just this. I went to <b>watch a couple more shows</b> from this season. Yes, this season, even if it's about halfway through already.<br /><br /><b>Classroom Crisis: </b>Yeah you're not seeing wrong here, but then since I was hooked by the opening theme song last night - with "last" being Saturday - I decided to give this show another chance, ever since I rejected it when I saw the previews. Episode 1 was in view here. Honestly saying, I thought of Glasslip. Not that it feels similar, but it's the worst case scenario, so perhaps... Anyways, this show has plenty of unhappy people, we'll be dealing with privatisation, astronomy and other space physics that I know quite a bit about, so this show will become boring sooner or later. Besides, the drama is minimal, which is a direct inverse of Glasslip, where plenty of drama is not covered by that little action, furthermore it's without explanation. So I guess for this show I'll just listen to the theme song instead. Yeah, Trysail. Not ClariS.<br /><b>Game of Laplace: </b>Why this? Well, I was flipping through Anime for next season (yes that is so me) and one from next season caught my attention. And guess what? It's a show from the noitamina slot, famous for specially selected adaptations, and honestly saying I totally forgot. And coming back a season (which is now) I came across another noitamina production. This show? If you watched Hyouka or even UN-GO then this show is for you. And I think for me too. Mystery show from adapted mystery novel, weird circumstances, and only the smartest and quirkiest can solve it. Compare Oreki, Yuuki and Akechi with their partners Chitanda, Inga and Kobayashi, both with smart minds and quirky antics towards mystery solving respectively. Perfect combination for watching this show up to this point, and I really wonder why I haven't watched this. Theme songs are very fresh in an aspect (even though they could've been better; I'm starting to miss School Food Punishment already), and I think I'm going for seconds after I finish this. So if you would excuse me I'd like to catch up with this ASAP, haha.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Amari Mawari:</b> Someone is jealous. But then seeing as this is a romance show for minors (really it's very close to child porn), I guess this is rather understandable. But not in a grown-up level, so I guess that's fine. It's a short chapter too. Just comparing Nozo and Amari together. I can take Nozo anytime. lol (I'm not into kids anyway haha)<br /><br />SHOW(S)<br /><b>MythBusters: </b>Man I already start to wonder why they keep sending guest stars anyway... But never mind. This episode, they say it's superhumans in shooting, but then the hitman myth is pretty possible for humans anyway. If Adam and Jamie were using real bullets it could've been real. The other myth though... they should try putting their hands in molten lead to see what happens. We may not even see the bullet firing anyway. And yeah what about other kinds of bullets? Guess not. They'll travel slower than a sports car anyway.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week brings quite a few releases that I'm interested in, so I'll talk briefly because I'll talk about them next week too. <b>WORKING!!! new single</b> of theme songs has arrived, and I must say I'm pleased yet not satisfied with how the full songs end up, but seeing that it's the last time I'll get theme songs like that already I'll give them anyway. (Yeah this is the kind of bias I give sometimes) <b>TrySail's 2nd single</b> is to be ignored earlier this month, but then it caught my attention again as I faintly recall the chorus, and now it has come to stay. The whole single. Yes, I've pre-ordered. Hopefully I'll get the gifts. I may have just missed it lol. <b>miwa's new single</b> is also up earlier than expected, and until the music video comes out soon I'll hold my opinion. From the listening of it I must say it sounds not bad. I might just give the whole single a listen.<br /><br /><br />That's it, folks. As I have an Anime marathon to catch, I'll not bother myself anymore with this post. Good thing it's already half -written by the time I do this now, haha. Cya guys then, and until next week hopefully I'll give more insight to the three shows I'm this season. Bye!<br />[P.S.: I can't tell you to look away because there's cuteness and sexiness at the same time.<img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11836928_10153574721517460_6582100850464019388_n.jpg?oh=553448db0cd5e2991fddccce5a9945c6&amp;oe=563A8BDB&amp;__gda__=1450378281_b6543372b90a76eab53d272c3bcb7f3c" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/11825752_10153577800797460_8883102287436382610_n.jpg?oh=3e7e1a7156d3cc5b0c79c26228145eb4&amp;oe=563D6834" style="text-align: center;" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11828624_10153579882887460_104861344166856265_n.jpg?oh=0507033e23f12c2dcc9d462a6c26d7f9&amp;oe=563C2C12" style="text-align: center;" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11885401_10153582215967460_734979720819303396_n.jpg?oh=8a8babcfa04715443bf2ed7fa654e386&amp;oe=567738C4&amp;__gda__=1450937339_4cc3589412f6f92a6bb842a8e346f229" style="text-align: center;" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/11899866_10153584130127460_8630265113571269496_n.jpg?oh=23322d0c42625b9671fcc86c69499ced&amp;oe=5679A1D9&amp;__gda__=1447217340_8298f90a9311723683df49c440ba6d70" style="text-align: center;" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11891037_10153586441097460_5234876981623230132_n.jpg?oh=5d0551c887d486deac898bd233a001e8&amp;oe=56749B29&amp;__gda__=1446625878_b37a59710bd73e125b39778915d9474e" style="text-align: center;" /><br />Kana-chan stepped in late this week, so I just took a couple for now. Next week more Tomacchan, and TrySail maybe if it comes next week.
