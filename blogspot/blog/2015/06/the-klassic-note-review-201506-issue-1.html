<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2015.06 Issue 1</h2>
Hey hey it's about time. Welcome back to another round of song appreciation and excitement. This time... it's all female. I know. I need to get (records of) some guys (alone) to sing good songs soon. *laughs* Let's begin.<br /><br />(I know. Tables are becoming a BIG ISSUE now. Make do without it, yes? I'll see if I can get it going...)<br />(Edit: Looks like I can below. See?)<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Toyosaki Aki - Uh-LaLa [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="初回生産限定盤" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/toyosaki_UhLaLa_SHOKAI_JK_0528A-RGB.JPG" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="初回生産限定盤" width="316" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="通常盤" src="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/img/common/artist_image/70005000/70005852/images/toyosaki_UhLaLa_TSUJO_JK_0528A-RGB.JPG" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="通常盤" width="284" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Close-ups are always great, but for this time round I am neutral. Both are great for a summer feel.)<br />Origin: As our dear Aki-neechan (as I like to call her already) reaches her 30s, she still is as cute as ever. Man, she can represent my impression of Japan already. Anyways, we all know I come a long way ever since her debut in 2010, and now she comes back with a summer song, a first in her singing career. It isn't bad after you take a listen, and especially if you couple it a cool drink, some shelter under the hot sun, and a radio to play the songs (on a CD, preferably), you'll feel the mood too. (That's what I've been doing when I got the stuff)<br /><br />(1) Uh-LaLa<br />Whoever thought of this title (I hope it's herself) must be rather desperate. It can mean many things in many levels, if you're as imaginative as me. Nonetheless, it's Tsuji Ayano writing the whole song this time round, and I must say it's not the first time I've heard her, and her writing for Aki-chan too. Her last impression (if you listen to her songs) should be "music", back in 2012, which fares somewhat the same when listening to this song too. Just that the song now is different in mood, and with plenty more English lyrics which we know that Aki-chan can't really sing in. Well this is not much of an issue anyway, not after you see that music video of her literally being like what Anime "K-ON!" Hirasawa Yui does on a summer day. Really. (whisper) It's awesome...!!!<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average, excluding fanservice)<br /><br />(2) Hoozuki [Ground Cherry]<br />If you don't know what plant it is even after looking at the translation, don't worry because you're not alone. Ignoring that, this song has its special feel, for there is only one person behind all three roles (if you understand what I mean) for this very localised song. Nonetheless, it does bring a relaxed summer feel to complement the first song, and besides the instrumental parts and the extended ending (the whole song is five minutes long, mind you), this song is actually pretty well done. The melody is rather nostalgic, and relaxed are its lyrics as it tries to represent the season.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Below Average)<br /><br />Conslusion: Overall not such a great single, comparing to her single last year of the same time frame, where she literally sings me a love song. However, this is another reason, that the fact it's a summer song, that the fact it's written by Tsuji Ayano (the A-side, the first song), this gives much reason for me, as a fan of her, to give her chance once again. Of course I know this isn't the worst impression of her singles, so this would fare as pretty good in my opinion. If you're not a fan of her, then I guess this is not for you. I can't possibly cut out the best parts of this single and let you listen to spoil your impression when you hear the full thing afterwards. Anyways, a good listen for Aki-chan yet again, but definitely not her beat.<br /><br />ALSO!<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />miwa - Kibou no WA/Gessoku ~winter moon~ [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/38/SRCL-8656.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/40/SRCL-8658.jpg?v=1" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Yes close-ups are better. *sob* But then I think the version I had is very beautiful too. More below.)<br /><br />Origin: After just one year, miwa-san brings us another double A-side single (as what it's called) (and if you don't know her by now it's not my problem), though this one I say is from last year. By now she has completed her tour final for her latest album "ONENESS" released just a few months ago, in which is also one of the reasons why I got this release now instead of like, eight months ago. Back then I didn't have the mood to give both songs, so I only gave the first one, and no more within the album. Only when I reached recently after watching the performance did I decide to give her due credit, and here it is.<br /><br />(1) Kibou no WA [Ring of Hope]<br />This one is one of those songs that sounds great when everyone sings together. If you would recall this would likely happen if it is credited to an organisation or a cause, in this case it is a group of children under OECD known as "Kan WA", thus the title of this song. And if you ever watched the music video, you wouldn't stop yourself from listening to this song again. With such a song written for its purpose of unison, no wonder I took it at first listen, without much hesitation. The fine lyrics coupled with a simple melody will be sure to hook anyone to join in this chorus.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />(2) Gesshoku ~winter moon~ [Lunar Eclipse ~winter moon~]<br />This song, in initial impression, wasn't outstanding. Probably I'm deterred because I don't have the mood for it, maybe it's because I don't accept the song, but this song as its special meaning in love. Furthermore if you understand the lyrics it's quite a lot about family, which is why there is much love in this song. And I guess this fundamentally mounts up to how this song is sung, and her live performance wins it all. Of course, if you ever get to listen to it.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Just listening to the singing makes me emotional. This is truly her birthday present to me. Thanks, miwa-san. <a href="http://t.co/DsZKEQcX0O">pic.twitter.com/DsZKEQcX0O</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/610842866697396224">June 16, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>Rating: 4 stars (Above Average, on second thought)<br /><br />Conclusion: Now that I gave the other song on this release, then yes it's a listen. It's a very good listen, and an encouraging one if you intend to cheer people up with a couple of song from a wonderful voice rising from probably the best singer-songwriter in Japan. Man, this may be too exaggerating, but if you listened to her you'll agree. And with many of her singles this one is pretty good in itself. It is encouraging, filled with love, and has some sentiments with us, and that is what happened with me. I am touched, and I believe you guys would too.<br />(Honestly, I myself did not expect to get this single too. Even though I'm thinking about it. Reminds me of Aso Natsuko, if you recall.)<br /><br />-Kaineng, on Klassic Note<br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br />Of course, it's been some time since I waited for miwa, but then Aki-chan has already been decided like a couple of weeks ago, leaving me with little pre-order gifts to choose from. Thankfully, I still managed to get it, though I would want something else. Like, a better photo. Damn. I need to be their photographer someday. Just joking.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="155" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tMk4DgKKnPw/VYvLaiNqhqI/AAAAAAAAM5M/ih8j-iPoA3A/s320/IMG_20150625_144130.jpg" width="320" /></div>miwa's is from CDJapan because I want to clear my birthday points (hell yeah for her birthday too), and Aki-chan's from HMV Japan, so delivery transfers are minimal for me. The photo (or bromide as they call it) gift is not under a plastic slip (oh yeah now that I think about it the previous time I pre-ordered with a gift it's a poster not this), and I found out that the single is rotated 90 degrees. Very interesting indeed.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vowRHkcBixs/VYvLe8CJ82I/AAAAAAAAM5U/Vcl4tgeY8lg/s320/IMG_20150625_145308.jpg" width="228" /></div>What's more interesting is when I opened up miwa's single. So, so great that I can't even bear to scan it and keep it for myself. And I thought I won't get more surprises today. I was wrong. *laughs*<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="129" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JGyr9woMiwc/VYvLi8Y758I/AAAAAAAAM5c/mAdoHSWBlxs/s320/IMG_20150625_150039.jpg" width="320" /></div><br /><br />Well, I guess that's all. Considering that the latest review I had today may have its chance of getting on my shelf, we may not be far away from another review. Until now, these are my most satisfied releases for now. Especially miwa, that is why if you came from Twitter you'll know I emphasised on her, not on Aki-chan this time round. Cya guys soon then, and until next time... I can never bring myself to say things like "enjoy these releases", but I can say for myself "enjoy the releases that is Klassic Note".
