It's part of a singer's journey."</p><p dir="ltr">A man walks out of the room and I sneak in. Only one guy appears to hear her sing a new song, and the session is to teach us how to analyse lyrics.

Dreams are awesome, isn't it?</p><p dir="ltr">[P.S.: Probably also the reason why I may have to give Tsuji Shion a chance again.
