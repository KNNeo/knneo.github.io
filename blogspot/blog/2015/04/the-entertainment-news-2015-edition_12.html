<h2>The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #15</h2>
<p>Hi guys, and welcome back, if this isn‚Äôt you first time.</p> <p>I know. I need to think of a new title for next year.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>Assssination Classroom: </strong>Well this new episode for the week starts with Sugino and a baseball feud with the rest of the school. Apparently Koro-sensei did a good job in coaching the students, but the principal (?) (yeah the leader of the school) also did a good job in the psycho-ing of the baseball team. Seriously, it‚Äôs ridiculous, but still a joy to watch. I‚Äôm still wondering more about why there is a new opening theme song but not a new ending one.</p> <p>Now, the two new shows I mentioned about two weeks ago.</p> <p><strong>Punch Line:</strong> Well both are originals by the same animation group, so not much to talk about story. Suffice it to say this one has ridiculous circumstances, has plenty of it for a harem Anime, weird theme songs sung by the most unexpected combinations I can think of, but surprisingly everything else compensates itself for me to give a thumbs up. The characters are well distributed (for a harem style show), the story still has room for improvement and a clear conclusion (unlike Glasslip), the cast is pretty awesome (if you cannot recognise Kugimiya Rie, at least you can recognise Ten-chan, Tomacchan, and Mina-chan) (in order from my highest recognition), and the comedy is top. After thinking of all the pros and cons for this show, I decide to watch it for a few more episodes not because of the harem or the panties (I know, like Nagasarete Airantou type of show), but more of the story and the cast.</p> <p>I just think I can still watch it, provided the story doesn‚Äôt screw up. And I probably have to give a theme song too. Hmm‚Ä¶ *looks at both theme songs*</p> <p><strong>Plastic Memories:</strong> Something I forgot to start watching from last week, but oh well I caught up to it before this week‚Äôs episode. Anyways, it's mostly like the above, just that you deal with ‚Äúdeath‚Äù (of human androids though), and a lot of bad news. Ten-chan is show for the main girl AGAIN (don‚Äôt ask me why, of anything), as she acts the role of the Giftia which is close to its expiry date. Yeah, sad story, sounds possible. But the second episode begs some promise for making it a good one due to the fact that I‚Äôm focused too much on drama, means this show may bore me within the next few episodes. Hopefully not, because I‚Äôd like to see a wonderful conclusion. Not that I‚Äôve seen one.</p> <p>Funny these two new shows are originals, because probably there are too many sequels, but then I think these two have premise to watch. After this they may not even be considered. I‚Äôm looking forward to next season, as you can see, as many shows like‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll talk about them next time, yes?</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> Aizen got owned (not dead, seriously, I know Kubo), and it looks like some Sternritters want a chance for revenge against their leader. Trust is an issue here in BLEACH, huh. Everyone wants to betray their leader, knowing that it‚Äôs in any way impossible. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br><strong>One Week Friends: </strong>Someone got bored of the main scans group, so I get to benefit. Hase-kun still feels reluctant about his relationship with Kaori-chan, but I can see things are going in (generally) the right direction. It‚Äôs not far from the final chapter already (haiz I know it should‚Äôve ended by now), so I intend to see how things pan out for them. Also the secondary relationship between Kiryuu and Saki-chan too, really. (Though personally I think it won‚Äôt happen between them *shrugs*)</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>During this song influx week, I review many albums and a single.<strong> Mina-chan‚Äôs single</strong> was a tough decision, but in the end I decided to give the song with like‚Ä¶ 40% technopop. Come on, that really is not the issue, because I‚Äôm more worried about the production thinking that she is compatible with this style. Clearly she is not, according to me. <strong>miwa‚Äôs 4th album</strong> is pretty good, but then I only took two songs as of now. I‚Äôm hesitant of the style of the third song I intend to give, but I‚Äôll probably be taking that Doraemon movie theme song because I tweeted about it anyway:</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>OK, so I thought another song I probably have to give now. Oh well. That's Klassic Note for you. Listening to miwa - 360¬∞</p>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/586309037681065985" target="_blank">April 9, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  <p><strong>nano.RIPE ‚Äòs 4th album</strong> came a few days later than both of the above, but then it still sounds as‚Ä¶ generically great as their previous album(s). Currently I‚Äôll be taking on two of their songs (surprisingly not including the topic song?) and giving myself more time to absorb the rock goodness from them.</p> <p>On a side note, I landed on <strong>Yuuki Aoi-chan‚Äôs album</strong> again after listening to her song last year. Not bad I must say, and I ended up giving two (three if I‚Äôm generous) songs this week. Hmm, surprisingly it‚Äôs not the one who wrote the one I heard before. Interesting, but I‚Äôll still give what I like. Insider info and research only happens after giving the song anyway.</p> <p>Also, <strong>ClariS (first) best album</strong> is out early for next week, and I need two songs in order for it to be on my shelf so I can commemorate Alice‚Äôs departure from this group forever. (Oops) I shall see about it, yes? Influx makes me take more time to consider songs though.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I‚Äôm being very hesitant recently with songs, huh. Oh well perhaps I‚Äôm really searching for the melody, isn‚Äôt it? I don‚Äôt know. I just compromise. Hopefully not too much, or I may just give the whole nano.RIPE album. My exams are close, so I guess‚Ä¶ I should be doing something about it. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Cya guys next time, and until then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll also start on my plans for the long break ahead. After my exams. <span title="*wink*">üòâ</span></p> <p>[P.S.: Mikakoshi week is up, as you would‚Äôve known from last week, so‚Ä¶ BOOM!</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/10426277_10153239589042460_3284499899807312491_n.jpg?oh=3692a5a70ac5a8f7face38818e1d912a&amp;oe=55AC1D81" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11150428_10153242501807460_8336798074539307544_n.jpg?oh=49bc023383a6cd2245e72b85662ee063&amp;oe=55A06B7E" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/10257848_10153244841922460_9216249273231031100_n.jpg?oh=e78c4d8e8eca40af7820156a8690efde&amp;oe=5598DD56&amp;__gda__=1436934291_5b21fc0e19dd6f4d435cdda583937066" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11083929_10153247012992460_8372312929474339257_n.jpg?oh=fbea834317f2c004ed02ea00a24470a0&amp;oe=55E5F68C&amp;__gda__=1437190643_1a55b36a6a6e9bfc97fb28002da31b89" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/22587_10153249495642460_6890394582567152650_n.jpg?oh=4a2711ee235222cacafc5ac3dbd19dfe&amp;oe=55998FCD" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10944836_10153252115327460_8674571790523536117_n.jpg?oh=9d6e3a97447e0958901055497dd59e02&amp;oe=55A83D4C&amp;__gda__=1440552489_387a71ff3a94d8e1f6db5f90fa2457fb" width="135" height="240"></p> <p>Ten-chan‚Äôs just glad to be here, haha.
