<h2>The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #14</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m thinking of expanding my webpage making skills to another level. And then I noticed Iâ€™ll not want to do anything further than this, this or this. (eg. links to my other sites) So, I gave up. Shows how short my enthusiasm line is.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote>None this week. Not because thereâ€™s none, but the new season shows start next week, and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu (that Assasination thing) does not air this week too. Oh well. All the better for me, I guess? Nah, I want it back. I want progress.</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> Aizen speaks to the lowly inferior! Apparently still very arrogant and or himself, but then letâ€™s see how he does then. Hope weâ€™ll get to the action again soon, as all the shinigamis will know who is the REAL traitor. Yes, Iâ€™m looking at Ishida, dammit.<br><strong>Tonari no Kashiwagi-san:</strong> We then find out that there is nothing wrong with Kazuki, but something wrong with Saya-chan. Apparently she wants some affection, like physical affection, from his boyfriend. Aw man the tsundere faceâ€¦ and she got it, but she maybe asking for too much. Or is it Kazuki? The last part really is something to think aboutâ€¦</p> <p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Ehâ€¦ I got bored, or maybe I really want to give <strong>fhana </strong>a chance, so I gave that song that wasnâ€™t in it from when I reviewed their album. Or from the first time I went back and reviewed their first single when listening to their second (Iâ€™m talking about major debut here). Anyways, itâ€™s in the list, and weâ€™ll see more listening next week, where itâ€™ll be <strong>miwa VS nano.RIPE</strong>. Mina-chan doesnâ€™t count; sheâ€™s releasing a single and sheâ€™s in another area where Klassic Note is concerned. ðŸ˜†</p> <p> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>Even at low pitches she sounds great. That high pitched voice we're all familiar with. Thanks towana-san for being such a wonderful singer.</p>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/584026723005497344" target="_blank">April 3, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <blockquote lang="en" class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"> <p>And so, after three reviews starting from a year ago, I put this song on my list. Listening to fhana - Kimi to Iu Tokuiten [singular you]</p>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/584027370975272961" target="_blank">April 3, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I guess thatâ€™s it, even though itâ€™s pretty short. I still have a lab report to finish before I go crazy tomorrow. Cya guys next time then, and hopefully Iâ€™ll have more Anime to talk about. Hopefully two. Ideally one. Or not I can always depend on one show until the next season comes by, the one after this. Until next timeâ€¦ take care. Iâ€™mâ€¦ trying to take care of my education. It has not been easy.</p> <p>[P.S.: Not much this week becauseâ€¦</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10981853_10153222976542460_2368684120575846496_n.jpg?oh=32f1bcb239e73a4780eee9a24abb48b8&amp;oe=55BC825D" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11094200_10153225184277460_5796039174305432598_n.jpg?oh=2924ab0ece56051f413a6ccbcde060d3&amp;oe=55B7B2F3&amp;__gda__=1437123031_92dacafe6e6beb85c1fdfe4f9cd39947" width="135" height="240"><img alt="" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10425173_10153231839677460_2666262528526571499_n.jpg?oh=3ddde1bbb1ebf90239e037fa1000b3d1&amp;oe=55BDA3F2" width="135" height="240"></p> <p>Mikakoshiâ€™s photobook is finally here! And if Iâ€™m kind enough maybe (Ookubo) Rumi-chanâ€™s photobook too!
