<h2>The Entertainment News 2015 Edition Week #7</h2>
Hey guys, and welcome back. And if you’re not bored yet, I am. Haha, just joking. Anyways there isn’t much progress here in my life, but that doesn’t mean we don’t watch shows and listen to new songs. Okay, maybe not listen to songs too for me. *sigh*<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><strong>KimiUso:</strong> Wow. Interesting turn of development aside, we see another performance (possibly the last this season) between Kousei and his newfound student. Being the teacher, despite his nervousness, brings his student along for the final act. Which is seen live by Kaori-chan? On her hospital ward? Eh… I may not see any form of jealousness here, but something tells me things are going to go haywire once their performance is over. And it may not be anything but. I don’t know. I don’t read spoilers.<br /><strong>3-E Class:</strong> Not much of assassination is happening on the class, but more focus on discrimination of the class by the rest of the school as they come for their monthly assembly in the hall. Seeing that they are also enjoying their part of the world thanks to potential assassins and probably the best teacher on eight legs, it poses some thought on the higher end students, and also, the principal. I wonder if Aizen will step in to change this… (lol of course not, just the same guy behind the voice) <br /><strong>Koufuku Graffiti:</strong> There’s still food porn, but there’s also fanservice. Self-mistaken to see a hot spring scene, the couple ended up on the bathtub, doing some real slice of life thought (like they won’t go in together again) and action (the process of Ryou getting the ice cream). Unfortunately they still remember the audience, so too bad, this is as much as we would get. Must… get…Blu-Ray… version…<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9YoyBWjU7jY/VOCaC2jyAhI/AAAAAAAALoI/O_rqJhqNI4s/s1600/koufukugraffiti6_window.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9YoyBWjU7jY/VOCaC2jyAhI/AAAAAAAALoI/O_rqJhqNI4s/s1600/koufukugraffiti6_window.jpg" height="320" width="114" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yeah she’s referring to you, you pervs. And that includes me. *OMG*</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><strong>BLEACH:</strong> Now everyone knows (even Yuzu and Karin in the real world) that the worlds are about to collapse.<br /><br />…<br /><br />OK KUBO NOW WHAT??<br /><b>Amari Mawari: </b>Really you should lock your door AS SOON AS you enter your house. You wouldn't want a little girl to come to your house and be mistaken as a paedophile by her guardian. I'm just saying.<br /><br />SHOWS<br /><strong>MythBusters:</strong> Last episode for the season, the guys test on myths about the difficulty of drifting in real life. Well, with a professional things would be easy, but seeing that the pro also follows certain styles of execution, speeding using drifting definitely is not the way to go in real life. Really, even I don’t drift in racing games.<br /><strong>Looney Tunes, Tom &amp; Jerry:</strong> Yeah, been reminiscing about cartoon recently, and found an updated version over the Net, and more recently the Tom &amp; Jerry ones, and as I see one of them commenting over YouTube, it seems that “people who watch old cartoon grow up to be gentlemen”, and the youth now… I don’t want to talk about it. *laughs*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I know. I do not have the mood to listen to new songs nowadays.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en">Klassic Note fact: When I'm not in the mood to give songs is when everything sounds great. Especially with an influx of J-Pop and no J-Rock.<br />— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/566635776788557825">February 14, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>  But they’ve been showing promise. <strong>sphere’s best album</strong> is just two songs away from the order which I will be able to give over the next few days at least. <strong>Seven oops (7!!) new single</strong> crediting to the KimiUso ending is actually pretty awesome, and will be the first 5-star song for the year. If I give the B-side this may also be on my shelf too. I may also give another song from <strong>FLOWER FLOWER’s new list of songs</strong> from a movie, and I’ve given up giving songs from <strong>Sora no Method’s character song album</strong> half written by fhana’s composers. But I still see promise in giving to next week songs on release, with <strong>Coalamode’s first major single</strong> under KimiUso’s opening song. Probably if I can give the B-side… I shall see about it. Honestly, I desire some VELTPUNCH. Or QUATTRO. Or Ajikan (in a month’s time). Or nano.RIPE (two month’s time). Something. *sigh*<br /><br /><br />I guess that’s it. I’m still stuck in doing up “someone’s last will and testament” so I can push two more chapters of APoL, so don’t expect much for now already. As the festive season is happen on this side of the world, and me not getting a Valentine’s, I guess I shall sit back and relax for now, and also keep my guard for a phone call every day on 10am. (Haiz, haha) Anyways, enjoy yourselves people (totally motivated by the bath scene), and I shall see you guys back here again. On the fourth day of Chinese New Year.<br /><br />Great. Back to work. *sigh* *lands on new double-layer mattress*<br /><br />[P.S.: Plenty of Kayanon this week as I intend to clear the job of changing wallpapers on my phone everyday… Sadly the streak is not ending anytime soon. The last picture tells you I’ve got more.<br /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10924805_10153108968682460_8867804554158696845_n.jpg?oh=04a0830c428ed317e1d957def1c28d1c&amp;oe=555BA9D2&amp;__gda__=1435324868_ca7a7181d0bc70ce10b24102ec273784" width="135" /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10929956_10153111424177460_5249934050420974191_n.jpg?oh=05c3ae183f9265431968dc26c41dadb7&amp;oe=555FF4EE" width="135" /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10403127_10153112247587460_2131737812743628451_n.jpg?oh=0592bb3fb420a9865c5f1502b537d56c&amp;oe=558F9DA4" width="135" /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/13802_10153114035442460_6735159606314690015_n.jpg?oh=048c99dd3aa1d6a1011ec08078f18890&amp;oe=555B1B51" width="135" /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10376007_10153118394327460_6190512648182460295_n.jpg?oh=be9ea0042951bd7c2858e8f0876c109d&amp;oe=554F4C84&amp;__gda__=1435595233_adb241c2a7ab88b535e8afff0b4a231b" width="135" /><img alt="" height="240" src="https://scontent-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10996674_10153120561452460_7366043993649868817_n.jpg?oh=d21dceb9eb1b32a189fc70762f99e71f&amp;oe=558B9859" width="135" /><br />あきちゃんったら～]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
