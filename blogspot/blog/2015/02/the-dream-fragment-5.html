<h2>The Dream Fragment #5</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Well, this time round it happens to my phone. My cousin (and I know which one) happens to be looking at my phone, admiring the (if you do not know the brand then... I'm not repeating it here) phone itself. And suddenly he tore off the case that was holding it due to it looking worn off (cheap casing, you know) and made it so the back is gone. I told him to pay for it and he feigned ignorance. Adding on and telling him whoever did not pay for breaking people's stuff and it came to a pause. And I woke up.</p><p dir="ltr">I know. I did spoil people's things when I was young. And never bothered to compensate them. I'm such a jerk.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm done. Cya guys for more dreams sometime.</p><hr><h4>#The Dreams</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
