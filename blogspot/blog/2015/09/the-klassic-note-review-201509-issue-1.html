<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2015.09 Issue 1</h2>
And possibly the only issue. Next month then we'll see Tomacchan's new single.<br /><br />If "Goddammit" and "Finally" are the first words I say when I waited for the whole day, you aren't wrong. But then again it's my fault for delaying my purchase (if not I could've gotten it from where I want), so I can't blame anyone for that. Besides, this single is controversial, as I land myself into idolism again.<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Kotobuki Minako - Candy Color Pop [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/resize_image.php?image=08251120_55dbd0f8704fe.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.animate-onlineshop.jp/resize_image.php?image=08251122_55dbd15f688cd.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(I know, very "pop" in effects. And no close-ups again as usual, unless you're rich enough to get the Limited Edition. But then, I like the bird(s) in the album art.)<br /><br />Origin: If you're familiar with Klassic Note, you should know Mina-chan comes in a long line of idol music artists, which I myself refer to as "idolism" reviews, and where focus is placed upon giving the person more than giving the songs. In this case, Mina-chan has a unique and a nice voice. From her second album last year we've had a fair share of plenty of dance pop songs along with her classic "Kotobuki Rock" styles, the former is trying to convince me to like it as well as appreciate it, and so we're here. This time places the dance pop song in the front again, and should be her 3rd (from 'Prism' to 'pretty fever'), and this one turns my expectations around. I'll talk more about it below.<br /><br />(1) Candy Color Pop<br />Kudos to whoever is the person who thought of the song title, but then again (I know it's the lyricist, and) the composers themselves come back from doing the B-side of her previous single to this. I know I've been too kind to keep giving them chance, but a simple and short song I cannot miss. Why the initial bad impression? I can explain to you guys when I heard the instrumental version as I was reviewing the single: It's just beats until the chorus. You tell me how repetitive the beats are again. Then again, this song is given due to Mina-chan, a simple melody, and very creative (though not meaningful enough) lyrics. But then again, I saw the music video already, so who cares? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Time Capsule<br />This one was &nbsp;more of a catch when I first heard it, and decided and prepared to only give this song, but then when I heard the full song it wasn't impressive (the usual extended "bridge" mistake), and actually at one point in time decided to flip things around, by giving the A-side only instead. But no, I think this song is good, lyrics well done by the exact same person who did the previous song above (what a coincidence, huh), and I like the mood of the song. If you understand the lyrics then that is an added plus point.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Since I categorise her as someone I give total bias to like some others, she falls under the conclusion of "I like her and I like the songs she sings in it". But then again, the songs aren't bad, and the initial intention of production is obviously to entice many with a dance pop song, so I guess my review will be justified. Just go take a listen, and if you don't like it you don't like her. Simple. Then again, she sings nice songs, so I like to give her a chance. I wonder when I'll stop though. I thought I will, but then...<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Review by tonight.  (Goddamn finally after a week! *sigh*) <a href="http://t.co/MvuC2Fu4Cy">pic.twitter.com/MvuC2Fu4Cy</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/647352844455010304">September 25, 2015</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Well if you came here because of this Tweet, then you're at the right place. If you skipped everything to see if I'll repost this Tweet, then I suggest you go read the review first, and take a listen to Mina-chan's voice too.<br /><br />Then again, I'm also for the special photo gift anyways, and the selection process is limited because I gave the order only after I heard the full single, which means places like Animate and Gamers (which have the best photos yet again) (and that the latter is my best choice) will always be empty. Sony Music Japan was good, but then I ended up with Tower Records this time as I noticed, every single time I got her smiling, so this one does not. And then the perfectionist me also (now then) considered the cropped image size and how it fits on my phone (and just now also thought of how the logo will affect the crop too), and still didn't change my decision. Somehow regretting it already actually, but as always I like. The free gift. So I won't complain. I'm going to collect them all. Too bad I noticed that I can do so like, a year and a half ago. <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--6XY_Sb_CL4/Vhye2Qw_hTI/AAAAAAAARU4/zj4YLSNkh1o/s1600/SELFSCAN_20140111_212154.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--6XY_Sb_CL4/Vhye2Qw_hTI/AAAAAAAARU4/zj4YLSNkh1o/s200/SELFSCAN_20140111_212154.JPG" /></a></td><td><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-poWDsZJM4z0/Vhye1UlFACI/AAAAAAAARU4/Of45qzYDpV8/s1600/IMG_20140424_210136.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-poWDsZJM4z0/Vhye1UlFACI/AAAAAAAARU4/Of45qzYDpV8/s200/IMG_20140424_210136.jpg" /></a></td><td><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PrtnLa4KUTM/VhyerZnGB1I/AAAAAAAARU4/u-k_E6R1z2w/s1600/SELFSCAN_20150415_0001%2525257E2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PrtnLa4KUTM/VhyerZnGB1I/AAAAAAAARU4/u-k_E6R1z2w/s200/SELFSCAN_20150415_0001%2525257E2.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" colspan="3" style="text-align: center;">Mina-chan over the singles. I mean, I really like her smile. :)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />That's all, I guess. Cya guys next week, where I get my hands on Tomacchan's single, even though I ordered both of them (singles) (releases) (CDs, I mean) at the same day. Oh well, Tomacchan's new single only releases next week, but then hopefully I'll get it by the weekend. So don't go too far away, because I might just post another review quite soon.<br /><br />[P.S.: I recently read about a post in the Internet from a guy who went to her release event, and it was quite interesting. Trivia played a big part of the 2-hour event, and questions include how many birds there are in the regular edition album art cover to which alphabet does her song titles come out most frequently. Yeah, weird, and I will have failed as a fan, but then whoever knows it got some poster of some sort, so that's a way to treat an ultimate fan, I guess. I don't even know she doesn't like watermelons. How, Mina-chan? What about watermelon-cracking in summer? She'll miss out on so much.]<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
