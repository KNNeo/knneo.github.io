Hey, it's the last day of the month! Yeah, school's gonna start soon too. Well, to be exact, next week is my last week in this long journey. Haha I bet I'm the only one jealous of me taking such a long break...<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Yeah, this art club sure has a problem. And now they have a bigger one. Because they just changed club advisers from the don't-even-have-eyes Koyama-sensei (goodbye linchpin-up-till-now) to the... Tachibana-sensei, because I don't even know how to describe this woman. She's shy, she's worried, I think she's from the military or scouts of some sort with the salute (cheeky stuff in slice-of-life shows go a long way), and she overthinks too much. Hey, pretty much like me, besides the saluting lol. The students (those who are active, and I count Colette-san as inactive) drew portraits of her (Uchimaki-kun animated it of course) while she was sitting there like a rock, watching after them. I mean, I may have the curiosity to know what they were drawing, but now I have a feeling the teacher's good at following orders haha. Also, a lot of romance in Usami-san that Uchimaki has no idea of. But then hey, good reminder to those good times you don't have your homework and a friend has to deliver it to your house. I've tried that before. Being the recipient lol<br />P.S. Not that I'm MILF or anything, but I miss you, Moeka's mother. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Also, didn't know your father(or in-law) was (implied) Koyama-sensei. Hey, it all comes around!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kNuOG-f3nQQ/V54Rz05Mr_I/AAAAAAAAZ1I/oRoqnmN2v68prWS7SFiPz-X1uSoWHSXfQCLcB/s320/%255BHorribleSubs%255D%2BKono%2BBijutsubu%2Bni%2Bwa%2BMondai%2Bga%2BAru%2521%2B-%2B04%2B%255B1080p%255D.mkv_snapshot_05.40_%255B2016.07.31_22.56.53%255D.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That ass shot... must they do that, even for a moment? Geez...</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Time Travel Shoujo:</b> I must say, this show has a lot than it looks. If you missed this show don't say I didn't warn you about it.<br />This episode, about Volta, that guy who created the first battery ever. But then, I didn't Mari to be meeting her dad this early. Problem is, that's his dad from the past, and quite a few years ago. Bigger problem is, this time it's fast-moving. They were in the 1800s, a time of war, and the father seems to have taught the guys how to use that compass and the stuff in the lab. Unfortunately, it's also good time to know that the bad guys are trying to corner them up, and this will be a problem. Hey, little do we know this show actually has plot than just some history lesson going on with all the time travel thing going on. I'm looking forward to next week. And yeah, travelling to the past with a taser and a bulletproof vest makes you badass, I'm sure.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>BLEACH:</b> Well I guess this is about it lol<br />Anyways, the chapter. Wow I'm getting bored of saying it like this already haha. Well Ishida finally appeared, and for once we may have a chance to get rid of this future-reading God-like Quincy. Yes. He's still a Quincy after all. And if Zangetsu has to be the one to stop whilst Ishida gives that opportunity, then yes this might just be it. As I mentioned like, two months ago, we're near the end, so this is going to be the case if it ends here. Just enough time to wrap things up anyway.<br /><br />No I'm not feeling sad<br /><br /><br />MOVIE<br />I've been watching some movies recently, and I should have done it last week (watched two last week), but yeah, I'll do it now. Never too late to revive this segment back lol<br /><b>Minions (2015):</b> Yeah, this one. I mean, I watched the Despicable Me series before, so this is more than funny but also just entertaining. The ideas of the show are great though, and who doesn't like these little creatures who just want to follow someone evil?<br /><b>Peanuts Movie (2015): </b>From the production which is going to bring us Mutts in a movie (hey, I'm looking forward to it though) comes one of the most popular comics turned into animation and packaged in a movie. Yes, if you remember Snoopy you're in this with me lol. The movie is overall touching (I guess it's the chasing of a girl lol), and has many elements of art in it, basically flowing through the movie creativity from imagination (Snoopy flying on his kennel) to the whole thing of comic draws within 2D-like 3D animation... man the movie just looks great.<br /><b>Cinderella Movie (2015):</b> Some YouTube video brought me here, and it's not the trailer. But then this is a beautiful recreation of the fairy tale we're all familiar with (really, if you don't know the real story it's fine, you can live with this one), and hell yeah it's awesome. With the powers of CG, the fairy godmother becomes the MVP of this movie, and surprisingly the overall mood of the show is not harsh. Like, mocking harsh. They may be bad to Cinderella, but there isn't any full-on verbal abuser, which may be my impression of the story, apparently. Other than that, the show is more formal than I thought, which is good because they focus a lot on the plot and most importantly, romance. And it's good, I must say, watching this over this weekend.<br /><br />I know, right? Chasing after last year's movies. That or I have no mood to go to a cinema for them haha<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Eh... <b>SCANDAL's new single</b> isn't very impressive by all means, but then if this is for 10 years I wonder what is up next. <b>ClariS new single</b> is rather disappointing, and I decided to just leave it out for now. And I blame myself because I'm thinking of the past year songs of them that are good. Yeah, maybe it's just me. <b>Gotch's 2nd album</b> finally got to a conclusion in Klassic Note, and I decided to give one song that is none of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/KlCcssOqbqk" target="_blank">topic</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=/ZRC8vXiVym8" target="_blank">songs</a>, because I don't like its general style and I gave the last track because I missed the year 2011, specifically that compilation they have stopped doing.<br /><br />Next week brings a couple of releases, if I didn't remember wrongly should be <b>nano.RIPE's new single</b> (which I have not heard much of) and more crucially because there's that Anime, <b>Uesaka Sumire's new single</b>, which is probably my first review of her releases, so I hope it'll be good. Otherwise I may have to spend next week browsing indie artists again. It's about time BTW<br /><br /><br />This is it then. Cya guys next week, and yeah, I'm feeling sad. Feeling sad I cannot write out APoL. But then again I think I missed something important before I can continue writing, so this may be on hold until I get myself thinking. Until next time... the time has to come, so treasure it while it is ongoing.<br /><br />[P.S.: Which brings us to this segment, and yes, it'll be removed starting from the next issue. <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span><br /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13658926_10154405957947460_4423279845729176933_n.jpg?oh=70575809a3dae92e86eb6db5354a43d9&amp;oe=58251B9B" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13686615_10154408836152460_5001935298752611247_n.jpg?oh=f79e2bcbf4c9030b3baf8e11775bcf27&amp;oe=582B9AD8" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13631519_10154411553407460_4476151890802250781_n.jpg?oh=2637f031b51736e6d12891d9a5f11acf&amp;oe=5814B917" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13782210_10154414147422460_1311135148636988206_n.jpg?oh=8d96e1449cc146871ee28924605b0773&amp;oe=5818A727" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13873184_10154417089892460_3240924053152931452_n.jpg?oh=0c5f5a162737ce12a432c4c6cd957ce7&amp;oe=585E123A" /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sit4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13620699_10154419712002460_6064535167484798830_n.jpg?oh=7e78996fc9e027b3474b9f5d8357d751&amp;oe=581A0833" /><br />This last week it's Kana-chan galore!
