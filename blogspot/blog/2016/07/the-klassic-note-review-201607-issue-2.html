<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2016.07 Issue 2</h2>
I was thinking of a proper intro before I started... how about a Tweet?<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">What do these three singles have in common? Here's a hint: Ayahi-chan is missing.<br /><br />Top left single review soon. <a href="https://t.co/6rFcZWz2rQ" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/6rFcZWz2rQ</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/751008156713488384" target="_blank">July 7, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Sorry, Ayahi-chan. Your single isn't in it. It may happen someday. Or never. Whatever. I'm sorry.<br /><br />I'd like you guys to keep your emotions together, because this one is quite an emotional one. Still wondering why it isn't on my shelf for this long. Read on to find out more.<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Tomatsu Haruka - Baby Baby Love [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/2649/products/51VwD1R2mUL_71593a9b-5e07-4bba-9f88-9a23f553ffd8_large.jpeg?v=1439833904" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qcZUhwJoUAo/VesQTC-BGyI/AAAAAAAACOs/OO_TVnT2gSQ/s320/smcl-218.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Hey, it's all her acting cute. What can I say? Too cute, it's scaring me away? As usual, Regular Edition's better haha)<br /><br />Origin: Well, if you ever remember a time, where in order to promote the sphere girls (Tomacchan was one of them BTW) they managed to set them each a single to release on a certain November in 2010, and I was persuaded to take two of them. It probably took longer if not for her recent best albums, but then it finally came back. This belongs to one of those releases I have no idea why it didn't come in earlier, but now that it is here it's closer to completion, I guess.<br /><br />(1) Baby Baby Love<br />If anyone remembers this ending theme song from the Anime "To Love-Ru" series, this didn't come off back then as an impressive song. The tempo feels slow, but as a love song it definitely delivered. Coupled with the lyrics somewhat complimenting Tomacchan's quirky personality this is one of those songs she rarely sings but turns out to be good. It may be a tad bit long, and the music video may be too much fanservice yet again, but then who will complain? Overall a good song to compliment an Anime, so I won't say much since I don't remember much about it that is bad.<br />Rating (in 2010): 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) Yasashiki Hibi [Gentle Days]<br />Of course, it had to be the B-side. Coming in from the best album, I have been thinking a lot too when I am reviewing this now why didn't I give this song. It is generally well done, the music style is good, and the lyrics have quite a lot of meaning, if you understand even just some of it. Considering many more factors like time period and my bias in the past, I have determined the (un)likely thing that's stopping me from giving this maybe the slightly off melodic tunes of the verses of this otherwise good song. If you need a gentle song from Tomacchan, this one is it back then, so why wouldn't I give it six years ago? I don't know. This probably can also explain, but it might be due to listening many more of such a soft pop music style over the years, and this being one of them which is played quite often. Being on the best compilation, it may have moved me a little closer to what's actually good about her singing. At least, that's what I think.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Above Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall a nice single to have, even if there's no lively tunes to dance to or whatever. Tomacchan's exhibition of love is clearly shown in these two songs, and has definitely come a long way to being part of her image today. Six years back, I may not have liked it, but now I do. If you need some love you should definitely try her out. I mean, the music. It comes along as one of her many attempts to communicate love with us fans, but it's also a good release. Please be sure to give it a listen, and not be like me six years after release. It's never too late to give this wonderful single.<br /><br />-Kaineng, on the Klassic Note<br /><br /><br /><strike>THA</strike> THE PACKAGE<br />(I thought it'll look cool but then... Yah it's a typo okay??)<br />Not much here, as you can see with respect to the other single I reviewed a couple of days ago. But then again as I've reiterated many times above, it's good to be back. It's like it's been missing. Or that I liked the B-side so much I mention it a lot on Twitter. Hey, what to do?<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MtbxKISZibs/V35BvQyzB5I/AAAAAAAAYr8/UjvtpZQxBC8uUIC09o97o57o9fV1wI1BwCKgB/s320/IMG_20160707_190339.jpg" width="320" /></div>Reunion photos include the one at the very start of the post which still till today excludes Ayahi-chan, and the one below which should've been what came in and reviewed in the previous post. I know. I waste a lot of money. If only I remembered to add it in like, 12 hours before I realised it, I could've saved a bunch. Of time. <strike>If I sound like I don't have a mood now, you should've seen a livelier me two days ago.</strike> Man, still didn't believe she released two singles this close back then. Nowadays the pace has become slower without Anime credits already.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sLIxc7IjwSY/V35ByBFTK0I/AAAAAAAAYsA/-j6CszGsZDcK6F4GBj-MnQ6XYXSLVQ5SACKgB/s320/IMG_20160707_191657.jpg" width="320" /></div><br /><br />This is all. I'm thinking about next week, and after watching Tomacchan's new music videos in glorious full HD, I'm starting to want her already. (Audience: As in?) I don't know. She always presents that image, and I feel for her. Man, if she needs some love, I don't mind contributing. How unfortunately financially I have to do it. Oh well. Cya guys then.<br /><br />P.S. I didn't open that SCANDAL album I got for like, 24 hours. I mean, it's not mine. I got back money for letting my cousin pay me. But clearly, he doesn't know how to take care of the CD. Oh well, so long as he can take care of his gf... Not like I care, it's not my property now. ðŸ˜†<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
