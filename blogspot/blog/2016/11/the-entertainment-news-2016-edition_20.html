<h2>The Entertainment News 2016 Edition Issue #47</h2>
Wow. It's been hell of a week. A lot of revision, and now I'm (not) ready for the exams ahead of me. Damn, I'd rather exams are on like, Fridays so I can enjoy the weekend of watching Anime and stuff. Unfortunately, it's on a Monday. So I have to suffer this mood swing. Twice.<br /><br />Yes, next week too. *sob*<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Bungou Stray Dogs: </b>Wow this show just got a whole lot more exciting and complicated at the same time. I think I said that last week lol<br />The episode. The girls from the Agency are safe, after layers of saving by the brother and Kunikida, fortunately. Unfortunately though, Port Mafia's leader Mori Ougai let out their strongest prisoner Q (man they don't have better names than this?) (I've heard at least two more shows who use that alphabet) which can do mind control, and just like BLEACH if you have been reading this whole post faithfully for like three years lol, you would know it's tough to manage (controlled zombies, I mean), and in this case now that makes Atsuhi be a victim to his own past and powers. Things go a little out of hand again as Dazai tries to get the Agency a hand in this war by getting Ango in order to link with the government, but Francis, the leader of Guild as far as we know of, approaches that tiger of a bounty first. Hmm, and for all cliffhangers (damn I think I've been just summarising the plot here) Kyouka has to arrive. She's out, apparently, and hopefully to save the confused Atsushi. Really, he's confused about a lot of things, for sure. Next episode is going to be fun.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--TRQN_NYV3s/WDFLN4ZwBAI/AAAAAAAAb5w/bYiWU02BzSspBTDy5_CGemd7-5YbwCOwQCLcB/s320/bungoustraydogs19_toilet.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Well Atsushi is dumb anyway, so whatever, Dazai.<br />This toilet plot thing is really unnecessary haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Don't ask me about the abilities of the two Guild members who went for the Agency girls, really. One loves nature and kills all girls besides her sister WTF, and the other is an octopus?? Damn there are too many references here for me to be able to understand this show now.<br /><br /><b>Sangatsu no Lion: </b>Okay, this kind of builds on the fact that you can have retarded friends (according to Kiriyama) like Nikaidou, and I'll explain why. First, the lead up. Remember that close to romantic comedy we received last episode? It's back, but it's not the girl. Takahashi, that baseball player someone is really into, turns out to know of people who love shougi, probably including himself. Kiriyama noticed they can hit well (not in baseball unfortunately haha) after a conversation or two, but then Takahashi showed him that clip. Starring the professional shougi player on TV with Nikaidou doing commentary. *sigh* I totally feel you Kiriyama. Just like some other Anime who has a silent main guy (*wink* Hyouka *wink*) it's tough living with an assertive friend and people being envious about your situation which is bad in your opinion. Nonetheless, it triggers him somehow, and now he has to teach people Japanese chess. Hey, I'm not saying it's bad, but at some point I see myself already leaving when Nikaidou comes in every time. Come on, who wants to have direct conflict? Well, not unless you're playing a shougi match of course. And no, I'm not interested in the game, so no thanks for the explanations, Bodoro. *laughs*<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UY3QFJp6yvg/WDFS1Lm0ppI/AAAAAAAAb6A/pRYV4HDgrMMEAWWHZmbrP4YOHzjulRrXgCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion07_cats.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">What happens when you say "dinner" in front of your cats.<br />I bet the struggle was a sight to watch, Akari-san.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. TOTALLY didn't expect the ending theme song. OMG can they just stop<br /><br /><b>WWW.WORKING!!: </b>Okay, now I think I can confidently say something I absolutely hate about this show. It's weird. And it's not just weird. It's weird weird. If you get what I mean, it's just weird. So weird, it's starting to turn bad. Like a bunch of chocolates that are bought. Which has no taste. Left alone for a month outside the fridge.<br />Okay, the episode. A lot is going on, so I'll keep it short. Miyakoshi's totally weird logic gets her into another thought of dating Higashida in order to advance her cooking skills, but to no avail. I do not know now if she's serious about relationships or is she just now knowing how BGR works. But still, Higashida sees the consequences, and instead of scolding right at her make and making it straight like her mother did about the restaurant bill, he went along with it. And that, even so, is still not working on this dorkhead. Seriously, Miyakoshi-san, you need classes in being human. Also, Adachi's failed socialising skills led him into a worse situation than he is previous episode with Muranushi, and her complicated feelings for him has once again become even more negative. Kisaki is ordering that foreigner like a slave, Nagata-san is dejected as usual because she also cannot express her feelings for the main guy, and don't ask me why someone doesn't want to go to school but wants to go down South. To Okinawa, for example. Damn, this show is weird. Just like Shiho-san with words on poor people lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nNvIcPMIfCU/WDFa8p5FLKI/AAAAAAAAb6c/KayL1uu4vQQc6EeNc-bgNYjibq4rmXAjwCPcB/s320/www-working08_baby1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ivJiJCia4qk/WDFa8eyGYTI/AAAAAAAAb6c/Z36B5f1OnlUjUxL6wSjzIk2kmJcvkxSSwCPcB/s320/www-working08_baby2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(Not enough)<br />When you ain't got the chest, and...</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">(Satisfied)<br />... when you got the chest. Damn, didn't know this was a baby thing haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I can do a lot more jokes here this episode, but if I do I'll be real biased. But really, this show is ridiculously funny, in a weird sense.<br />P.P.S. Honestly, Miyakoshi Hana is a weird girl. I mean, she don't get crane games too. Seriously? Even if I NEVER played once in my life?? Ugh, like Higashida, her presence makes my head ache.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>No new chapters again this week. I'll try not to put a placeholder every week that looks the same, but that's no guarantee. I'll promise you that, at least.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>No, let's not talk about Ms.OOJA, yes? I regretted giving a listen to her latest music video already.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">And suddenly Ms.OOJA has sung out the voices of women perfectly.<br /><br />Beauty lies in the eye who watches this MV: <a href="https://t.co/4zNIcfx4rZ" target="_blank">https://t.co/4zNIcfx4rZ</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/798705372588453888" target="_blank">November 16, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Okay, this week has a couple of releases, and yes, I don't think it starts with her. But still, I eventually rejected listening to <b>Ms.OOJA's new album</b> not because of the music video but because I'm reaching a point of the year that I rather not give too many songs (it's got to do with song count) so she's off the list for this year. Next year... maybe? No promises to myself there though. On other releases, I chanced upon listening to <b>AOP's new single</b> once again after what I heard from last season's Anime I decided to give another chance, and I'm not disappointed, to say the least. <b>Aimer's new single</b> came in hot and quick, and I gave a song just because it's good, really. <b>sphere's new single</b> also came in, and it wasn't impressive until two things happened, because of (1) the music video which has a plot worth mentioning here, and (2) the LINE LIVE radio-like stream to talk about the new single. I ended up giving them the chance and I'm liking it now. Not the whole single though. Sorry, no new reviews this month.<br /><br />Talking about new songs too, there's much to talk about what's ahead until the end of the month. <b>ClariS, cinema staff, Chatmonchy and Kana-chan are all set to release new singles</b>, and I got a listen to them a couple of days ago. (Thanks private VPN app!) ClariS sounded fine so I might just give a listen ever since their previous collaboration single, cinema staff's topic song is just barely 2 minutes long, and Chatmonchy and Kana-chan's have potential. I'll hold my comments for now until I have the time to listen to them two weeks from now, but until then at least I'll be damned if <b>WORKING!! theme songs</b> will come up next week, after I'm done with my first wave of exams.<br /><br />On other things next month and so, I've heard a couple. <b>fumika's new single</b> is turning out to be quite interesting with a good share of English lyrics. Ugh, she can't sing English though... Anyways, and I thought that's bad until I heard that <b>Yuuki Aoi is coming up with a new mini-album</b> and the music video preview is literally just her skin pores (Audience: It's that close??!!) (Yeah) it really makes me cringe unnecessarily. I took a path to find out what happened to <b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY</b> the girls group (details in Twitter if you haven't seen it), and I may have to give <b>another release from Miyawaki Shion</b> yet again. Oh damn, it's the composer I'm giving, that's for sure haha<br /><br /><br />Yeah, exams. Since it starts early in the morning, I better sleep early too. I need the brain energy to (sleep) strive through 2 hours worth of stress. Cya guys then, and until next time... hey at least next Monday's paper is in the afternoon. *dry laughs*<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
