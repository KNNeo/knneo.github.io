<h2 class="title">THE 2.99 STARS PROJECT (2015): Songs That Didn't Make The Cut…</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
(Please note that I do not intend to offend any listener/artist/production whatsoever, because this is purely my opinion, and shall not be used as social media discrimination in any other way. Information here shall stay here (c) Klassic Note Song Awards 2015-2016)<br /><br />Good. Now that I got this out of the way... Welcome.<br /><br />It's been another year, and I did say it's another year of tough choices when it comes to selecting songs for awards, rankings and so on, right? You shall know of the answer. Right now. Because I reject a lot of songs every year, within every review I do. Why? Why bother to accept songs only when I'm actually rejecting more songs than accepting them? Well, for an array of reasons as explained previously on "The Imperfections of a Song", so you can read that before you come here, or just take a look on why these songs (which you might like or not) are even on this list.<br /><br />It's just like those songs got away. But then they aren't good. So what do I call these again?<br /><br />Presenting to you: THE 2.99 STARS PROJECT, where you know of course that 3-star ratings are the minimum I give to any song in Klassic Note. Just... just read on. I've explained my reasons enough below.<br />(Note: This is not the best I can make it look. But then this is the first year, so I'm thinking of another way to present this for next year, so... yeah. Sorry. Reading the following is also not necessary.)<br /><br />(In review chronological order, and those in * are re-accepted because I didn't reject them enough)<br />(Grouped by release for your reading convenience)<br />Song Name: Baka<br />Artist<span style="white-space: pre;">: </span>KANA-BOON<br />Single/Album of Reference: Silhouette<br />Comment: It sounds too stupid?

Or hopefully next year. When I drop my standards for a short period of time. Or their next album.<br /><div><br /><br />Really, I swear, this is only a portion of what I could've rejected, and because they are close, and they are worth mentioning. I aim to make sure I talk about one every release, but that may not be possible.<br /><br />Also, I've done up the compilations list by now, so be sure to check them out! As usual it's the SIDETRACK COMPILATION and this-year exclusive HAPPINESS COLLECTION that is taking some time to confirm, so if you have been waiting... I'm not retarded. I just need some more time. Especially with the distraction of new songs from the new year. Okay, cya guys next time.</div><hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
