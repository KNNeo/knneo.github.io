<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2016.06 Issue 1</h2>
Hey, I'm back! In part two of the TrySail-Klassic Note Review Special (I just thought of it on the spot haha) I review another of their latest singles this year, and yes it's been three weeks since its release already, but I'm still hyped listening to it, seriously. Let's start, shall we?<br /><br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />TrySail - High Free Spirits [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/30/SVWC-70151.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 979px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/32/SVWC-70153.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 979px;" width="200" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img class="mfp-img" src="http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/05/34/SVWC-70155.jpg?v=2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-height: 979px;" width="200" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Anime Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(I watched one-third an episode of Anime Haifuri, so I'll not mention about the Anime cover. Otherwise, face cams are awesome, but Nan-chan taking the front for the Regular Edition is pretty awesome in some way too.)<br /><br />Origin: TrySail may not sound familiar to you, but it's a long way for these girls since their first single almost a year ago. Amamiya 'Ten-chan" Sora isn't as emotive as now, Asakura "Mocho" Momo isn't as serious as before, and Natsukawa "Nan-chan" Shiina isn't as confused as she looks today. Okay, it's all referencing to the 4th single they are in now, and of course they have recently released their album a week ago. All in all, it's smooth-sailing for TrySail (get it?) singing cute pop songs all around, and sometimes serious cool songs sound great on them too. This harmony, you don't get anywhere else.<br /><br />(1) High Free Spirits<br />This turns out to be a surprisingly good song for another upbeat song from them since their second single, and this sounds even better than back then. Crediting to Anime Haifuri (which isn't great IMO) it of course has lyrics with respect to that, but then the melody is overall very catchy especially the chorus, and till today I'm still hooked onto it. This will no doubt make of a good live performance tune, and man am I hyped to listen to them sing this someday. The music video... allow me to reference you guys to a specific Entertainment News a couple of weeks ago where I quote from Ten-chan the timestamps for the best shots she can imagine from her blog, and yes they are awesome. Somewhat this brings in more hype than usual for my impression of the song itself, but hey, whatever it takes to make it awesome, I guess.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Yes Ten-chan, your back is real awesome... Hah!<br /><br />More music video images and supernovae here <a href="https://t.co/yziaUCkEaF">https://t.co/yziaUCkEaF</a> <a href="https://t.co/JRGsSV6Z4c">pic.twitter.com/JRGsSV6Z4c</a></div>â€” Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/731817044153245696">May 15, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />Rating: 4 stars (Awesome-Slightly-Above Average)<br /><br /><br />(2) Bokura no Symphony [Our Symphony]<br />This is that deal breaker as always, B-sides. Stuck with their 3rd single I have been waiting for the album to get released, this one got stuck quite a while before I gave the thumbs up. First impressions aren't great with a general consensus (from myself lol) that the verses of the song do not tie up well with the chorus, and feels like two parts. But after listening a couple more times I have been convinced that it does pair in well, and since the melody is well done I have no reason to reject the song, a common way of giving songs in Klassic Note today. Otherwise, this song has a cute feeling to it, cohesiveness is blatantly written in the title, and yeah, it'll make you want to sing along. This song also greatly reminds me of their tough journey along as actors in general, and that this is quite a symbol of it. Anime composers like to do that, apparently. Yes, talking about you, Aniplex.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Somewhat Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: If you need comparison, it's better than their previous single just purely based on the B-side, but then overall than I guess the topic songs cannot compete because it's cute vs cool, which is a very controversial topic in Klassic Note in terms of a single artist group's style especially when dictated by foreign composers, yes? But then this is your usual average single, and I recommend you to listen to it. Really, the topic song (A-side) won't disappoint.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E2gDXmaobdk/V1AlfvBsDjI/AAAAAAAAXiE/wbWXFpI31Nk8M8y68m10YPPkGsoxQi8OwCKgB/s200/IMG_20160602_170828.jpg" width="150" /></div>No, it wasn't anything special in this oversized box. Yes, it was all cushion paper and I got scammed of my shipping fees. Because it highly depends on weight of the package, this make me pay like, 380yen more than usual. Man, I thought Aniplex+ you guys follow Sony Music Japan's slim packaging? What's with the waste of resources? You're not shipping to Africa, you know.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UQTufYMKmQA/V1Alm7_ysWI/AAAAAAAAXiI/Axmp_JAZ3GYYxBYuJnirpZIXhfPYXzZ5gCKgB/s320/IMG_20160602_192648.jpg" width="320" /></div>Anyways, inside reveals a similar booklet I've seen in the previous single, and this one is AWESOME. I personally scanned it for my personal pleasure (haha), but you guys can get this camera shot for now. I don't even want to say which is my favourite now. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NRwvNII3nNI/V1Alo_CQ0cI/AAAAAAAAXiM/gG_2lCBGHa06PVCpszRPWAl64cUlOwXewCKgB/s1600/IMG_20160602_194437.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NRwvNII3nNI/V1Alo_CQ0cI/AAAAAAAAXiM/gG_2lCBGHa06PVCpszRPWAl64cUlOwXewCKgB/s320/IMG_20160602_194437.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>There you go, the girls of TrySail. Sorry for the album though, I'll make it up to you girls some time soon, I guess? Somehow? Hey, in Klassic Note support for singles is easier okay?<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DJi2_WbcMP0/V1AlwkIsZfI/AAAAAAAAXiU/oeJMzVMylOUe3m-Y9GQ0wOBPLn7qb2VYgCKgB/s400/IMG_20160602_195056.jpg" width="400" /></div><br /><br /><br />That's it then. I'm tired, and I have to shape up that special gift, yes? *laughs hard* Cya guys this weekend, while I report on my (lack of) progress in life.<br /><br />*sigh*<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
