<h2>The Entertainment News 2016 Edition Issue #34</h2>
Just... thinking a lot. About life. Hey, isn't getting through university about getting a job at the end of it? Yeah, that's a problem for me. *sigh*<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!: </b>Wow, what an episode. Yeah, I've been teased of the new character in the Anime, but then he's spewing a whole lot of trash (get it?), and yes, we never got to know his name. And guess what? I don't even want to find out! *laughs hard* That's the joke that is infused in this show, and yes it's deserving of my attention at least. This idiot spikes Usami-chan off and thus besides Yumeko-sensei's encouragement becomes the basis for her and Uchimaki-kun to participate the next competition with another Anime wife. The details I shall not explain, but yeah, they won haha. Second half is close to Colette-chan, and about future occupations apparently. I don't know much to say about this (I didn't have to fill in one of them anyway haha), but then again Imari-chan may have helped out there somehow, I guess. Seriously, she can be an actor or even a cosplayer if that is all she can do haha<br />P.S. If you laughed as hard as the Club President and Colette-chan when someone said "wife", you have the potential to enjoy this show, if you know what I mean.<br />P.P.S. ONE IS NOT ENOUGH THIS WEEK SO I PUT TWO! YES! (Audience: Only this week?)<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pBL0yjg6FIM/V7by7iEovPI/AAAAAAAAaJc/j9ZqE7NxO8kR7wdaHT1uWV1xXdBViugoACLcB/s1600/konobi07_colette.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pBL0yjg6FIM/V7by7iEovPI/AAAAAAAAaJc/j9ZqE7NxO8kR7wdaHT1uWV1xXdBViugoACLcB/s320/konobi07_colette.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Best image of the episode.

About 3D girls.<br />(He's like, "I don't even want to see it!")</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Time Travel Shoujo: </b>The genius amongst us has been revealed. I didn't mean to get excited over this, but yes, now we know why Mari-chan is the main girl in this show. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />The episode brings us back to another time, but with certain control. Shun has understood and is able to operate the time travelling machine, and this brings us another moment of Mari-chan and her father, who apparently is selling stuff in the past? Not that, but he is fixing mistakes he done with relation to people in the past (in this case Morse) because he screwed it up? Of course, it might be more than that, but it seems like Shun has found it out, and is encouraging the depressed-over-her-test-results Mari-chan to not give up. (No spoilers here, I assure you) The "bad guys" haven't found a way to get into the lab yet which is good news, and the father has no intention to come back. To conclude, I have noticed that the father has done two major mistakes before his time travelling trips and maybe doing it because of either or both reasons. He should have (1) not fired all his lab staff before boarding on such a trip because no one will be managing it (then again it's some secret too so...) and (2) he should hire someone to do so, which in this case Shun has done a great job I must say. The likely chance the father and Shun know the same thing (no spoilers, I promise), and that'll explain a lot of the father's intentions. Stay tuned for more, because I'm hyped up for this show too. The ending really is going to be a game changer here, really.<br />P.S. Yes Fuuta, we know how you got 80 on that test. Waka-chan wasn't revising with Mari-chan. No wonder you freaking passed you lucky bastard haha. Then again Mari-chan doesn't need help?<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-obNMIcNHi74/V7hLF573SGI/AAAAAAAAaKw/xQcj5NBIdYsxf8Fc6E9sJNVqH0uuRVgpwCLcB/s1600/timetravelshoujo07_mari.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-obNMIcNHi74/V7hLF573SGI/AAAAAAAAaKw/xQcj5NBIdYsxf8Fc6E9sJNVqH0uuRVgpwCLcB/s320/timetravelshoujo07_mari.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The expressions in this show are fantastic. Loving Aki-chan more every episode, really.<br />BTW this is Mari-chan's "you're lying" face.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>æ¼«ç”»</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>BLEACH: </b>Wow. The ten-year-later thing keeps on giving. A lot of weird stuff, apparently. (I'm going to use the word "apparently" a lot of times so listen up!) Apparently (you see?), it's been ten years too in the human world. And yes, Soul Society too. What we do not know of are supposedly, Ichigo and Orihime are married! And had a kid!! Same with Renji and Rukia!?? And she's a shinigami apprentice already?? OMG what the heck is happening right now... So Kubo gave us an ending most would likely expect but not me (no really, not me), and what a lead up to it. Problem is, since it's the last chapter (#BLEACHRIP) we'll never know one thing: Is Ichigo's kid some soul entity too? Well, what we do know from the chapter are that there's a 13th squad captain that is out (which is likely Rukia if anyone is not guessing), Soul Society is definitely open to souls visiting humans (to Ichigo's house at least), and yes, the next generation is a thing. It's unlikely Kubo will continue the adventures of wacky Abarai Ichika (which sounds totally cool) and itchy-handed Kusosaki Kazui (which sounds totally uncool haha) but hey, there's the ending. It'll probably take a lot to take it all in, but there's more news. <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-08-18/bleach-manga-gets-live-action-film-in-2018-starring-sota-fukushi/.105510" target="_blank">A live action movie</a> is in production as hinted previously and announced this chapter, and will be out 2018. I don't know how far this is going to go, but then if it is we shall see how great it goes.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guo-a-ucRDw/V7mU9ZOO9fI/AAAAAAAAaLk/TaaVDP7XrJgPsAHZwk4jSexn8CBR48JIgCLcB/s1600/668-12.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="209" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guo-a-ucRDw/V7mU9ZOO9fI/AAAAAAAAaLk/TaaVDP7XrJgPsAHZwk4jSexn8CBR48JIgCLcB/s320/668-12.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">She's a wily one, that Ichika-chan.<br />(I can't put myself to crop anything else, so something this funny would do)</td></tr></tbody></table>And thanks again Kubo and BLEACH, for giving many years of joy. It has been a ride. -Kaineng<br />P.S. I WANT MY ANIME BACK!! Someone owes us a final arc season.<br />P.P.S. After a weekend of reading, I've found out a lot more. That I've been wrong, and even more puzzled to the stuff that has not been explained, like the fate of Zero Division of even the linchpin that is the Soul King. Well if we assume it has always been alive then I guess someone being alive is keeping the worlds stable, I guess.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>éŸ³æ¥½</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week brings quite a couple of releases worth mentioning. Either that or I didn't bother to find out new tunes anyway haha. <b>Aimer's new single</b> was okay, but not as I expected (I mean, the previous one I reviewed on May seems better), but I'll give a take on her new album when it gets releases next month. I've decided to give her a chance after like, 5 years now. Also, her first TV appearance sure is great. I'm just glad I'm not shocked by her appearance. No, she's fine. Also learnt quite a lot about how her voice came to be. I've taken some time to listen to <b>LuckLife's 2nd single</b> till date (at least, major debut) and I'm really impressed. Now I really want them to appear again in that Anime they major debuted in <span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span> next season <span title="*wink*">ðŸ˜‰</span>. Along with the TV appearance of Aimer I've exposed myself to another song, and yes, I most likely will give a listen to <b>Cocco's next album</b> when it comes out. I just found the new topic song most impressive.<br /><br />Next week brings <b>Ikimono's new double A-side single</b> (I have a feeling I want to reject it lol) and <b>AoP's new single</b> from that Anime above, and I think I'll like the girls. Well, I mean, the songs. I'm not interested in large groups of females. I'm not a pimp haha<br /><br /><br />This is it I guess. I mean, I'm lazy to think right now. I need a break from all the studying (that I've been NOT doing haha), but then again I should be more proactive. I guess it's that group project that's getting in my way lol. Cya guys next week, and until next time... damn the manga section is going to feel a whole lot emptier without the weekly series. <span title="*sob*">ðŸ˜¢</span><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
