<h2 class="title">The Klassic Note Review 2016.09 Issue 1</h2>
<div class="header"></div>
I don't take any chances in saying whether this is the only one, but then again it might just be. Besides that, I shall get this done as soon as possible since I have the time now. Well, if I wish for more time left I won't have more anyway.<br /><br />Okay, let's move on with the review. Aki-chan, you finally came, huh.<br /><br />THE KLASSIC NOTE REVIEW<br />Toyosaki Aki - walk on Believer [Single]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.sonymusicshop.jp/img/1/item/SMC/L00/000/SMCL000000441__640_640_102400_jpg.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.sonymusicshop.jp/img/1/item/SMC/L00/000/SMCL000000443__640_640_102400_jpg.jpg" style="-webkit-user-select: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Limited Edition</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Regular Edition</td></tr></tbody></table>(Yeah, you bet I love the close-up. Makes me happy pre-ordering this already xD)<br /><br />Origin: If you read regularly here, you'll know Aki-chan is a trouper in Klassic Note already, impressing me with one release after another. And since her 3rd album in March this year, she has kicked off another new single yet again. Keeping the active trend, I feel inclined to support her once again, and of course, the songs did not disappoint. At least, not too much.<br /><br />(1) walk on Believer<br />Don't ask me why the title is like this, but it's simple in meaning if you think outside the box. This is yet another hearty and lovely song from her in a slower pace, as if it were from a slice-of-life Anime or something. The story depicts (and also in the music video) her enjoying an afternoon in the local cafe. The mood, the feelings, the happiness within, all within this song that I can hear even without the lyrics itself. So I must say, overall it's good. Unfortunately I started from the impressive 90-second preview from her radio show so it turns out not as good. Don't worry because I took a couple more listens before I did this review in a more positive light. Of course there's the usual extended bridge part of the song (instrumentals this time round), but I must say, this is another song in the line of staple relaxed and happy songs from Toyosaki Aki. I like. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br />Rating: 4 stars (Average)<br /><br />(2) My Curry<br />Here's where the conversation's at this single, because even the title of this B-side song deserves a lot more attention. Aki-chan has done many to talk about her love for curry (Japanese style, people), she talks a lot about it in her blog, the single special campaign features a prize of (supposedly) her own curry recipe, and she has even cooked in her radio show, live! So yeah, she does have a lot to talk about when it comes to that kinda spicy stuff. On the other hand, the melody isn't that great, and considering it's a short song, it was kind of a disappointment. The preview again is a good cover for what the 3-minute song has to offer, but I'll let it pass. It does resemble a similar feel to another song that is this simple from her other single "Delight" from two years ago. The same guy who also wrote "Osanpo no Uta" and "anniversary"... I guess I could like his compositions somehow. Aki-chan's voice takes all the credit for me giving this one.<br />Rating: 4 stars (Below Average)<br /><br />Conclusion: All in all a good single to listen to especially if you like good old Aki-chan (I don't mean that) and are a fan of her. I know I am, and you should listen too. If you liked a simple style of music, these songs may be up your alley for some reason. Combined with Aki-chan's unique cute voice is sure to make you fall for her. The dating plan is all up, gentlemen. Just... buy her new single.<br /><br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AB0ogdfmZJE/V80Nb7AP60I/AAAAAAAAaeY/GMlC6Hjsqzs7p17kVHmCeyFoDHm47-37gCLcB/s320/IMG_20160905_132327.jpg" width="320" /></div>Okay, the package. Dammit again I'm paying for a larger box which makes me pay more for shipping. Really, when shipping is expensive the package is small. Now the reverse happens? Argh. Dammit SonyMusicShop Japan! !@#$%&amp;*?!!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="236" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sSJua55n5SI/V80Ngy37M6I/AAAAAAAAaec/o1ccNgoYj8QxYrlkuvNbGTgaTVBIV1i7gCLcB/s320/IMG_20160905_133815.jpg" width="320" /></div>Inside, we get the usual digipak offering which I like, and then again decorated with images I've seen all last week from her homepage. The repeats sure are a lot on this one. Then again I'm just here for the special gift photo, so... haha. Also, what's behind the disc I'll leave it to you to think about it. It's spaghetti, if anyone's wondering, and that's not on the web for viewing.<br /><br /><br />This is it. I'm off for naps. Dammit. Or maybe I'm just off to reflect about life. It's pivotal right now, so I guess I'll have to really start thinking about it and skipping classes is not an option even today. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yeah you bet I did. Cya guys soon.<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
