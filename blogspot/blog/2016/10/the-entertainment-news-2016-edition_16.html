<br />Oh I didn't put in an introduction? You know I don't give a **** about it liao right?? Oh well what the heck. Another week another whatever so let's get started. Anime is more interesting than this paragraph seriously lol<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> Okay, if three episodes and they don't focus mainly on Shougi, then I'll watch this.<br />Why so? First episode impressions are great, so great I want to continue watching. Unfortunately, there is a problem. This show focuses on Kiriyama Rei, a kid who apparently (1) won a Shougi match and became a pro, (2) apparently beaten his dad who is likely also a pro, and (3) has been staying away from his family for some reason. A lot of these things had us to believe that he is depressed all the time, which I guess is not surprising. Luckily, he is blessed with knowing the Kawamoto family and the three sisters, and I must say my motivation of watching this show is no doubt from these three girls. Okay, and the cats which cannot stop talking lol. Overall the first episode brings of a slice-of-life drama waiting for be unveiled, and I want to give this show a chance. Problem is I don't even know in that one match Rei played today whether he won or not. Yeah, you know. I don't play Shougi. But for the rest of the show I might just watch it, really. It sets the light-hearted mood, it's funny sometimes (actually more than that), and it's well-driven by the story. Forced maybe the sisters, but the story of this show isn't. Now I know why the original manga was an award piece. If only a Japanese chess game didn't stop between me giving this show a thumbs up...<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zB-CLqI8ZPI/WALnRhZIqeI/AAAAAAAAbL4/U-93Lvmp4A0OyD-8DdxVeaOKqqMuJnoWwCLcB/s320/sangatsunolion01_grandpa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">With granddaughters this cute, it's no wonder the old man is grinning end to end haha<br />#canthelpbut</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Kana-chan for best girl of possibly this show. Her hyper-activeness is beaming right into me haha. Also the accompanying female-driven sound effects are <i>really</i> awesome.<br /><br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs:</b> Wow, what an episode. And here I thought this small arc is ending already.<br />Guess what? It isn't, and for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we know of the truth. That Mimic is fierce in keeping mum about their workings, even if Dazai tried an elaborate plot on them. Akutagawa had to interfere but that was just him being noob lol. Then again there is a trace, and it was a trap. Odasaku (thanks to Dazai I only remember Oda-kun haha) was hurried to check what happened in the building Dazai found a trace to, and walked right into a trap, or two. Ango got saved, but Odasaku didn't. I'll leave it you to watch the episode, but suffice it to say everything Ango said was the truth. He wasn't wrong about spying, about the Port Mafia boss being the only one of the organisation to know about it (I mean, until Odasaku was notified about it), but he was wrong about taking sides. So likely Ango was at the other side now, and the boss also knew of it, but sent Odasaku to find out what happened, and yeah, he was pretty much the bait. Or maybe a little less of it if it weren't his impatience for Dazai's team to appear. Oh well, easy way to get rid of the last of information left by the secret group, but it seems there's more to come. Former soldiers with abilities? I mean, the military today don't have that kind of advantage man. Good thing the author didn't intend to summon Dazai every single time a fighting starts haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tqc53eH0SYo/WALvE0BibwI/AAAAAAAAbMI/sttieCFGYn4-TQhyF7hZKqMz8iQnWDJfwCLcB/s1600/bungoustraydogs14_explosion.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tqc53eH0SYo/WALvE0BibwI/AAAAAAAAbMI/sttieCFGYn4-TQhyF7hZKqMz8iQnWDJfwCLcB/s320/bungoustraydogs14_explosion.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Just because Odasaku can predict seconds into the future.<br />Just because Ango knew of it and set a trap just for him.<br />(Spoiler: This part wasn't the end yet)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>WWW.WORKING!!: </b>Nice. Nice episode. In this show they are not shy about romances, huh. We shall see.<br />The new episode brings us a lot more development than I can desire for this show. But then, it's fun, isn't it? They start with a test of courage. Oh, and did I mention there's a... man I don't even know how to describe her. I guess she's still alive? Just very close to death? Whatever. This new character is a spirit, and along with Higashida's newly introduced classmate (at least to us) Nagata-san we got our final pair of characters. Then they throw most of the cast - like, literally, they got Shiho's guards to throw them in - into the middle of a forest (it was Kouno's idea WTF) (probably sponsored by Shiho WTFx2) so they can get scared? Hey the pairings are naturally mutual too, besides the part where money is involved lolol. Otherwise, we got a good insight about most of the cast, and for most of the time it scared the guys more than the girls lol. All in all this is a wonderful episode. With new classmates introduced, a little more about Miyakoshi's parents in the past *lick* and a whole lot more misunderstandings in between... I'm going to like what's happening next. Hope it doesn't disappoint.<br />P.S. Adachi and Sayuri-chan for best couple, yes? Hey, I like the underdog romances here, if you don't mind me bossing about it haha<br />P.P.S. I guess licking lollies maybe too normal, so I got another image lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xTw4nOymdtk/WAL2pcN6UEI/AAAAAAAAbMY/hBQXwTucid87TtjJVMKryyZQFLIc9JrnACLcB/s320/www-working03_ghost.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Man, this <strike>ghost</strike> girl sticks out like a carrot at night haha</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>Koufuku Graffiti:</b> It's been some time, the manga itself has also officially ended, but I'm far from finishing it. Well, at least, not me. We're at summer, where the girls are in summer school so they did not get to enjoy the festivals and everything else within it besides tests. But then Shiina brought the two girls to her house, welcomed by her super-cute mother, and assisted by the Shiina-look-alike Tsuyuko-san they had some nagashisoumen, and if you don't know what's that Anime Nichijou taught me well haha. Otherwise, you'd be pleased to know Kirin absolutely enjoyed herself in this small festival, and it all ready to tackle schoolwork! Yay for her really.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rIdCvYuUuEY/WALfCAUKzHI/AAAAAAAAbLo/NuYzYgT1GS88qRJGexmDFPuwmSxOLZEJACLcB/s1600/kfgf7_festival.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="238" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rIdCvYuUuEY/WALfCAUKzHI/AAAAAAAAbLo/NuYzYgT1GS88qRJGexmDFPuwmSxOLZEJACLcB/s320/kfgf7_festival.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Hey if you have a big enough (farm) house, don't forget to bring over your friends once in a while haha</td></tr></tbody></table>On a side note, Makoto-sensei has finished this manga, and if I'm not wrong is set to release a photobook series of her own drawing soon. Check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/kwimkt05" target="_blank">Twitter account</a> for some great artwork.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><strike>The days are grim in the progression of Klassic Note</strike> Hey it's been another week, and... (Audience: Was that on purpose?) (What do you think?) I kind of failed to pick up the pace of getting new songs. But hey, there is progression. <b>Mikakoshi's new single</b> finally got into review, and I'm real tempted at one point to give the single. But I didn't. Maybe I should. It gets to stay in my mind for another week. I also took the liberty to listen to <b>eufonius' new album</b>, one of their releases once again and it was still rather disappointing. On the other hand, <b>amazarashi's new mini-album</b> was quite good, so I gave two instead of one. You can find the topic song music video online, I promise you. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Also, we're a step closer to this season Anime's theme songs, starting with SCREEN mode amongst many others by the end of the month.<br /><br />Next week though, brings us the next best thing I've been waiting for the year, and that is <b>nano.RIPE's new album</b>. I hope to not be disappointed. At least I wish so. A little more worry is placed on <b>Satou Satomi's new single</b> which I haven't gotten a listen yet, and even if I did I may not be impressed going from the previews I heard recently. Oh well, when it comes out I'll give a chance. On other things, November is going to be great for many releases to... release? And yeah, Ayachi's new topic song sounds surprisingly good. Hmm my tastes are changing...<br /><br /><br />This is it then. I'm really not in the mood for this. Probably will have more of a mood next week when a lot of stuff next week ends. I'm also considering how to continue this in the new year because I'll be spending five of seven days a week staring at the monitor. Also, playing of Mafia III. Oh well, when time comes I'll think about it. Or I could finish the game before next year. I'll see for it myself. Although I would like to continue writing of APoL someday. Really. I have myself to answer someday.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
