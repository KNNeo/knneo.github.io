<h2>The Entertainment News 2016 Edition Issue #43</h2>
Okay, let's finish this quick. I need to... I'm not going to tell you. Never mind that, let's do this before the week ends. Damn, Anime on a Sunday...<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Sangatsu no Lion:</b> This is good animation, people. Be convinced.<br /><br />*silence*<br /><br />Okay, now I can talk about the episode. *laughs* It's a short end to part 2 in an episode, but who cares. That rival of his is irritating as sh*t without the butler. The story is well written into parts, well narrated to mean many stuff in the story, which is important for people like me to learn to appreciate such a slice-of-life show. Then again, let's talk about what's not that good about it. Firstly, and my utmost concern, Shougi. Not that I know of it, but having a match half dictated this episode makes me wonder if I want to continue this show. And then, it's too long, the narration. But hey, drama is boring too, so this maybe better. Also, it's tough to get to follow these kind of show because of its nature of jumping scenes from one to another, from reminiscence to the main story. It's not bad, but it's just dislocated sometimes considering it's an adaptation. I swear the author himself would have done much better at capturing this, but then that's kind of a personal opinion, I guess. All in all, I want to give that three episode rule, and hopefully next episode is not like KimiUso where I have to literally watch half an episode of Japanese chess. Please, or else I'll say goodbye to this and take BUMP OF CHICKEN with me.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bRsA-7vob1Y/WAtUn1RgJ3I/AAAAAAAAbVQ/QZzb1Vcukt8YmKUn2AHHkE_wj1d0dmvBQCLcB/s320/3gatsunolion02_gag.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Didn't expect to see amateur porn on this show lol. #gagging<br />But hey, Akari is a matured woman.</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. Akari (voiced by Kayanon FYI) is probably the most matured female I've watched in Anime. That, and out of gratefulness, makes her the best saviour in Kiriyama's life ever, I hope. I tell you, it'll be mine too if I ever get drunk with a bunch of upper-class chess players in the bar that she works in lol<br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs: </b><strike>Wait, what happened to last episode?? Did Odasaku just miraculously recover??</strike><br /><strike>Okay, this last episode about the Dark Era, I don't get it. As you may recall someone touched a poisoned ball set up by his friend Ango, right? So now what? He's alive again? *checks back last episode* Wait, so they played two episodes within a week??</strike><br /><br />I'm sorry, but I may have to start this again. Seriously f**ked up this one now. And I finally knew the reason behind it. There has been simulcast of the next episode after the current on the same week (15 is what is on the official Twitter), and I seemed to have watched ahead. No wonder everything doesn't make sense. How about I talk about the end of the Dark Era now so I can skip this next week, yes?<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HziIxPEqS2Y/WAtlDJcxLmI/AAAAAAAAbVg/QNaWTFr_7MEWrJW7w0d5ptfGCOebtyK7ACLcB/s1600/bungoustraydogs15_akutagawa.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HziIxPEqS2Y/WAtlDJcxLmI/AAAAAAAAbVg/QNaWTFr_7MEWrJW7w0d5ptfGCOebtyK7ACLcB/s320/bungoustraydogs15_akutagawa.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">#bulletproof</td></tr></tbody></table>Okay, what happened. Odasaku apparently was just poisoned, but I assume it's paralysis, which is why he can be in the hospital and his friend Ango will never kill him this way. Then again, it's a lot to happen in a while. Odasaku also crossed hands with the leader of the Mimic guild, and like him, has predictive powers, which is a problem. There can only be one, and there will always be conflict of abilities. So yeah, problem is that Gilde (that leader) wanted a reason to die again, thinking that he was a soldier who was meant to die after a battlefield. But then Odasaku doesn't want to die, or grant them that death, ie. fight with that freak. I mean, I understand this all, and it's a little of real life too, but... just shoot yourself already you piece of sh*t. Don't go killing people with your superior power or blowing kids up in a van. Which would have more impact had I not watched it in the wrong order. (!@#$%&amp;*!!) Nonetheless, it wasn't for revenge, but Odasaku shall eliminate the opponent himself. Dazai didn't want to help, seeing that Ango was a triple undercover agent for the government, has understood that the leader of &nbsp;Port Mafia has allowed Odasaku to meet his own death in favour of a license to operate with ability power users in the country, which is business reasonable I guess. Dammit this show, so complicated, Kafuka-sensei, but I like. Also, Dazai made the right choice by listening to his friend before he dies to move on to saving people. Lastly, anyone remembers where Ango is now? He's not dead... right??<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aKnhlXcuRRg/WAtlKNbl6QI/AAAAAAAAbVk/auUgsfFBKOQp35n4V_ynr7cbfpdVzMQIQCLcB/s1600/bungoustraydogs16_permit.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aKnhlXcuRRg/WAtlKNbl6QI/AAAAAAAAbVk/auUgsfFBKOQp35n4V_ynr7cbfpdVzMQIQCLcB/s320/bungoustraydogs16_permit.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">All for doing bad stuff legally. Under control.<br />Is this what Port Mafia wanted? Well, in business this is good enough.</td></tr></tbody></table>Next week, or actually two weeks from now, will brings us back to canon material. Thank goodness. I'll follow the episode number strictly from then on, and we'll talk about what else Dazai can do after he leaves Port Mafia. Apparently even finding some creative way to die is also part of his past haha<br /><br /><br /><b>WWW.WORKING!!: </b>Screw you Saint Valentine! The heck you appearing on this show again...<br />Okay, the episode lol. Too many laughs, I cannot stop. It's not the time to give chocolates, but it seems Miyakoshi can only make chocolate. How does the mother not even spend some time to teach the kid to cook? I thought cooking is important in defining a quality trait for the future wife? Oh well, not like Higashida should be eating sh*t chocolate anyway. I mean, there's easy-to-read Nagata-san. *laughs loudly* Anyways, there's more to that than just chocolate. Let's skip Shiho-san's part for now (heck, can they not make it so wrong?), and focus ourselves on that prospective couple I think is great. Yeah, talking about Adachi and Muranushi. Then again, the guy doesn't know if he's in love, and the girl - like how she doesn't believe in ghosts - doesn't believe she is doing anything for love. Well, I mean, her jokes aside (if you knew when it started), I think this reality may dawn upon them soon. Then again, we don't have far to look at, seeing the spirit just stuffed some real (edible) (won't-have-to-experience-death) chocolate up his mouth. We shall see how this goes. This show got potential haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VWCk1edrvAc/WAwgMLLC9sI/AAAAAAAAbV8/yTllEHwTfUoy8h4Pyjnsuxby05m66qXKgCLcB/s1600/www-working04_date.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VWCk1edrvAc/WAwgMLLC9sI/AAAAAAAAbV8/yTllEHwTfUoy8h4Pyjnsuxby05m66qXKgCLcB/s320/www-working04_date.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Miyakoshi's mother screwed calendar dates up. Twice.<br />Guess we can't be good at everything haha</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. I don't know it's money or what, but this discrimination between Shiho and Yuuta is just terrible. It goes further than the world problems we have today. Please, Ten-chan, stop. It hurts watching you act this part.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote>Nothing. Either that or I don't have the energy to catch up with Seitokai Yakuindomo and I cannot continue reading Bungou Stray Dogs because the Anime is running. Oh well.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Not much this week, except the fact that I managed to <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-klassic-note-review-201610-issue-1.html" target="_blank">order <b>Mikakoshi's new single</b> and review it</a> within the same week, so that's kind of good. Also, Sambomaster's limited edition single that shouldn't have been on my shelf. Oh well, whatever. <b>Satomi-chan's new single </b>finally came out somehow, and at first impression I don't see why I would even give one of the three songs. <b>nano.RIPE's new album</b> is still missing somewhere (which is why I need a music subscription soon), and there is follow up for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WzsHv8I6-Q" target="_blank">SWANKY DANK</a>. Well, kind of. A new music video appeared online soon after that one I watched, so that probably will be in next week.<br /><br />I've only given one song in order to review the single, so don't ask me for recommendations. On the other hand, I watched some <b>rock festival live performances</b> in the afternoon so that's going to set things up for next week until next month comes where I'll see more new releases. We'll see.<br /><br /><br />We'll see about what I said above, yes? I hate presentations, BTW. Especially those driven by a project I know little about. Okay, just a rant to keep me going. Soon. Cya guys next week then, and until then... I need more songs. New ones. That I think are fresh. That aren't techno. That... can make me remember the true spirit of Klassic Note. Man, I miss those days. I need to listen to more of those next week.<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
