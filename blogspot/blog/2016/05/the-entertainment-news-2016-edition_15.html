<h2>The Entertainment News 2016 Edition Issue #20</h2>
I think I should stop doing an intro. I do best in explaining the status of my life after I've talked about what's awesome about it. *sob*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />ANIME</span></div></blockquote><b>Assassination Classroom S2: </b>EPIC FIGHT, as they say, must happen. Funny, how it ends depends very strongly in their relationship, considering how much they have been together until Nagisa got scared of how violent Karma is. I mean, it's goddamn third year already, and we're here all wanting to kill an octopus, so yeah. But then Karma decided to give in for he remembers Nagisa's effort for trying, even if he is weak in combat against him. Oh well, I guess the author has an answer, so I'll take it. Surprisingly, Karasuma-sensei wants them to find a method to save the teacher within a month. Will it be possible? Quite unlikely, but then there is the process. And we're still far from finishing this show. So yeah, looking forward to those then. I'll also be waiting the day Nagisa kills the octopus, even though I've not seen any spoilers. If I'm correct please don't tell me haha<br />P.S. Next episode: The 3-E Class in OUTER SPACE! WTF is wrong with this show...<br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs:</b> This show is nice to watch, seriously. Comedy, action, everything.<br />Okay, today's episode maybe quite heavily focused on Kunikida-kun himself, but then again the show is about to unfold itself. He knows himself a lot of informants in order to keep his business around, and one of them is this handy taxi driver. Think GTA IV's Muhammed for example. But then again it's also because of the driver's background - that he gave up his job as an actor because it was not profitable - that got him into the trouble of being the culprit to this serial kidnapping case, what's more one victim involving Port Mafia. I don't want to think of that girl from where Akutagawa was with back in episode three, but then even if it is the guy's here to rip sh*t anyway. So yeah, some action, some ladies (man Dazai is totally right about her being sexy lol) (the power of words on lack of clothing is awesome), and a whole lot of mystery involving an ex-terrorist. He may not be as lucky as an undead (*wink* Achmed *wink*), but his Messenger is sure alive. So next episode they have to intentionally set up a bomb to blow it up at a certain location? I mean, it's shady as hell, and considering Kunikida went in the news (which is likely the Messenger's doing than the taxi driver) it seems impossible to avoid. We shall see.<br />P.S. I think I know who's the Azure Messenger as mentioned above. That hacker the stepfather is trying to protect. Very suspicious. Also, that girl Dazai had a night with. *laughs*<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>漫画</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br />MANGA</span></div></blockquote><b>BLEACH: </b>Eh... all but the end I don't get it. Well, Renji and Rukia has an illusion that they are fighting enemies against Hitsugaya's brother (lolol), that Quincy leader decides not to use his foretelling skills to kill his supposed son, and he is now releasing his I-don't-know-what power to prevent his son from leaving. Okay, whatever, Kubo. Please make this good. And more importantly, make his logical. It still sounds a little hazy right now...<br /><b>Bungou Stray Dogs:</b> Caught up with a couple of chapters till the episode with the awesome Ranpo-san and his NOT ability user powers, but then I didn't stop there for this reason only. Also, next chapter involves character I do not see in the Anime. Oops. That also means I may have to stop from here. Which is fine. The next time I'll read it is probably the end of the year then haha<br />Note to self: Stopped at Chapter 6. Man, their chapters are very packed.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;"><br />This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><img height="266" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/crabnebula/lead_960.jpg?1452797426" style="-webkit-user-select: none;" width="400" /></div>This, is a famous image of a supernova. Just Googled it a while ago. And yes, it's also in Aimer's latest music video. By the way, this image, not from the video.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">Wait, so the new Aimer MV is just a bunch of astronomical phenomenons? Or has her songs been like this?<br /><br />*sigh*</div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/731755583943008256">May 15, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>Okay, jokes aside, this week brings quite a lot of releases, apart from the stuff I decided to give second chances to. <b>Aimer's latest single with EGOIST's chelly</b> is one of them for the month, but then it isn't that bad. I never missed her style because she started her debut single on BLEACH conventional pop and not this, so this is just... one of those I took a liking to. Don't get me wrong; I did give her previous releases chances. At least twice. I can even tell you specifically which ones.<br /><br />Besides that, we have the expected reviews. <b>TrySail's 4th single</b> is surprisingly good, and I'm still thinking of whether to give the B-side. (The music video, still better than Aimer, haha.) This decision can go on for so long because I'm guaranteed the First Press Release for this and their previous single which released three months ago online, so yeah, I intend to take forever. Or even until when their album releases in two weeks. <b>LuckLife's major debut single</b> for Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" isn't that bad, but not good enough for me to actually give anything, I guess. Sometimes, Anime produced songs bring out the best of a band, haha. (ie. Without them they aren't that fabulous, I think) <b>SpecialThanks new mini-album</b> came in late for the week, but I did manage to listen to it over the weekend. Both topic songs which have music videos (go ahead to check my YouTube playlist for both of them) are on my list, and otherwise... I guess not. Man, giving chances to SpecialThanks running this melodic punk style is hard. Recall MINAMI NiNE. Very similar. And Misaki-chan's English is real bad. Her Japanese though is sweet! *silence* Did I just... make a pun there? (Audience: You most definitely did!)<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This is such a SWEET yet very emotional song. And for reasons that is not Misaki-chan this SpecialThanks song is in. <a href="https://t.co/fLdX34KwRt">https://t.co/fLdX34KwRt</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/731674168417091584">May 15, 2016</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />For next week, I'm slightly ahead to give <b>Porno Graffitti's new single</b> for now (yes, their name is unheard of in this blog) and even earlier, <b>Miyawaki Shion's mini-album</b>, both released at the last week of the month in two weeks time. Otherwise, I'm excited for <b>cinema staff's new album</b> next week, and I haven't had a chance to give Cocoro Auction a new song yet. Maybe I should. *looks above paragraph* The vocals ratio is going to topple to one side yet again.<br /><br /><br />Yeah, that's about it. I'm stunned by many songs this week, and I'm still in thinking. Of many things. Other than music. So... yeah. Cya guys next time, and until then... Anyone here playing GTA Online like, every other day? I don't mind being your Social Club friend~<br /><br />[P.S.: Nothing but schoolgirl Tomacchan for the week. Best.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" aria-busy="true" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowliftCaption" class="spotlight" height="200" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13177703_10154208457017460_1207346762826837591_n.jpg?oh=6d804895ea105d1693b7c94368ec9f05&amp;oe=57E5DAAA" /></div>What's better, you ask? Kana-chan's Twitter image on my phone. What's even better? You guys saw the <a href="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/artist/kanahanazawa/info/468111" target="_blank">special gift images for her latest single</a>? My heart's on Toranoana (3rd one), but my body's on her in the water. You know which one. Haha.]<br /><br />[P.P.S. Because <a href="http://ameblo.jp/amamiyasorablog/entry-12159110964.html" target="_blank">Ten-chan wrote in her blog</a>, I decided to see what she was referring to in her group's latest music video. At "0:43" she refers to Mocho tilting her head back whilst singing, and at "4:19" she was referring to the close-up on Nan-chan touching her hair. Both are great but Ten-chan, what about you? Oh yeah, it's at "2:19", where she back faces us. Last paragraph. You're welcome.<br /><br /><br /><br />...<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-OaGX1QXts/Vzhh2Zj2CII/AAAAAAAAXWY/1p5eRuMO92QR3mJJNka02eQM77n3VlfbACKgB/s1600/PDVD_001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="112" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-OaGX1QXts/Vzhh2Zj2CII/AAAAAAAAXWY/1p5eRuMO92QR3mJJNka02eQM77n3VlfbACKgB/s200/PDVD_001.JPG" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vZjFxZSTirk/Vzhh2f0fucI/AAAAAAAAXWc/Jsp-VoJrDzARZ2EguBPDLmTHZ8bQF4QrwCKgB/s1600/PDVD_002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="112" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vZjFxZSTirk/Vzhh2f0fucI/AAAAAAAAXWc/Jsp-VoJrDzARZ2EguBPDLmTHZ8bQF4QrwCKgB/s200/PDVD_002.JPG" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DVr4FXlfyDA/Vzhh2ZK2sBI/AAAAAAAAXWg/Fn3ouODnQs4rrrIdzUkU11vVQIsDc8s2gCKgB/s1600/PDVD_000.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="112" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DVr4FXlfyDA/Vzhh2ZK2sBI/AAAAAAAAXWg/Fn3ouODnQs4rrrIdzUkU11vVQIsDc8s2gCKgB/s200/PDVD_000.JPG" width="200" /></a></div>Okay, there you go. Images. (Audience: Yay!) No GIFs though. Or maybe I should. For myself. Anyways Ten-chan. I get those feminine stuff. Don't think I missed them. I'm referring to your blog.]<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
