<h2>The Klassic Note Review 2016.05 Issue 1</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />Remember I promised about a month ago that I'd show you guys what the Ikimonogakari 10th year best compilation is like inside? Well, here we are.<br /><br />THE PACKAGE<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NDkSdVramtk/VzA71xxDTXI/AAAAAAAAXOQ/0qBipdKaWqIYLHZt07QCO_Yh3wzZ_ajzACKgB/s400/IMG_20160509_143616.jpg" width="400" /></div>And yes, I opened it. Firstly, I noticed the booklet. It's thick. And other than that, it's not stapled. Which means I cannot scan any of the pages visibly enough for you guys to see. Suffice it to say every one of the animals constitute to one song for a list of images spreading three discs, and some snippets of the members playing around with astronaut outfits and safari outfits. Yes, I said "safari".<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />Of course, the CD isn't the only thing in this purchase. As I have mentioned some time ago if you remember, I went for the special Lawson Edition with some... extra goods, which, for some reason that I don't want to mention, I gave them to my sis, who is also a fan of this group. Yeah, probably also the ONLY one we have in common interest. Anyways, it consists of a towel very common in live performances as goods, and some bag. Yes, other than the CD. It costs... about 8 bucks more in my calculations, so I guess it's worth it. I mean, I NEVER went to any of their lives...<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-size: 20px 20px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><a href="http://www.lawson.co.jp/campaign/ikimonogakari/img/06.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.lawson.co.jp/campaign/ikimonogakari/img/06.jpg" height="252" style="background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, rgb(238, 238, 238) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, rgb(238, 238, 238) 75%, rgb(238, 238, 238) 100%), linear-gradient(45deg, rgb(238, 238, 238) 25%, white 25%, white 75%, rgb(238, 238, 238) 75%, rgb(238, 238, 238) 100%); background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px; background-size: 20px 20px; user-select: none;" width="400" /></a></span></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lawson.co.jp/campaign/ikimonogakari/img/06.jpg" target="_blank">I'm reviewing the 3CD version, by the way.</a><br /><a href="http://www.lawson.co.jp/campaign/ikimonogakari/img/06.jpg" target="_blank">(Image shows both versions + towel + "vinyl purse bag")</a></td></tr></tbody></table>And here it is in all its glory: (from top to bottom - towel, the purse bag, CD)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jJLPmj-eTaA/VzA9Ci7Xl4I/AAAAAAAAXOc/LO7js67yaWMmOSRwPmrXw0nXW5rKY-N0QCKgB/s320/IMG_20160509_144101.jpg" width="236" /></div>And then the review. I only focused on the new songs I enlisted into Klassic Note, and overall it's a nice experience. I mean, you cannot get any better than having the product itself. *laughs* And halfway through I sort of forgot that the first image I took probably will not include what the Ikimono card (if anyone is familiar, comes with any First Press Release ie. if you pre-order you'll definitely get it) is behind the all so familiar image of them in astronaut suits. So I flipped the card around and here it is.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yp2SwtKciJA/VzA9kmB7GwI/AAAAAAAAXOg/wH6mOnQsd1galYhyzFmacO22uMHvROkNwCKgB/s400/IMG_20160509_144822.jpg" width="400" /></div>Zoomed in:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmWe5efZG-o/VzA9uCaCbwI/AAAAAAAAXOo/KzyCQBuqh-wmRBNUEKCCf9oEGxDcVGA7QCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160509_0001.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hmWe5efZG-o/VzA9uCaCbwI/AAAAAAAAXOo/KzyCQBuqh-wmRBNUEKCCf9oEGxDcVGA7QCLcB/s320/IMG_20160509_0001.png" width="222" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Thanks for 10 years!!!"</td></tr></tbody></table>You're welcome, Kiyoe-san, Mizuno-kun and Hotaka-san.
