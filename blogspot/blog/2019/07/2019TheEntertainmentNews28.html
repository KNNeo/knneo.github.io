You're wrong. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><br />Yes, I'm back, I have to do OT like soon, so I'll post this early. If there are any news I missed in the Klassic Note segment because that's when people like to post stuff on Twitter, I'll talk about them next week. Remember, only Takagi-san will be updated tomorrow haha <span title="*thumbs up*">üëç</span><br /><br />Let's start. If you noticed the site changed again I must have failed at restoring and patching this place over the weekend haha *looks aside* lol let's start<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tejina Senpai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Even Physics has abandoned her" You're damn right dude her jugs just shake so much it defies Physics too lol</div></blockquote>"Do you have something long and hard?" Wow for a moment but thank goodness you threw out the ruler or else... <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this weirder episode (2) it's not about magic anymore it's just logic ie. how dumb the Senpai can be lol. To be honest? I think the Senpai is me irl but I don't know magic and I'm not a woman. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Oh also I'm not a masochist haha. Anyways, about this episode. Unlike the Assistant who doesn't get to leave, I think I'm leaving haha. Let's talk about why. In this episode, the show still kind of holds to its style from the first episode, delivering kind of half-assed magic tricks, mostly ecchi stuff, and a little lack of progression mainly because again, it repeats itself every time, the skeleton of this series. To recap, it's Senpai screws it up, Assistant comes for the save (or not), and things somehow get worse. Pretty much evidently seen in every part, from smoking a super spicy curry because she accidentally kicked the bottle into it, to doing a quick change of clothes trick only to notice she didn't bring a change of clothes... The author is literally using the same technique Senpai uses to bring us to their attention, and it's not magic. We are also, of course, given an insight to Senpai's loner character and self-enthusiasm after Assistant-kun realised that this is not even a club yet, so he is already stuck with her for the next 3 years poor dude (well maybe 2 if Senpai doesn't do a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ronin" target="_blank">ronin</a> lmao), which also means I should just let him suffer alone and leave. So yeah, I think I am dropping this series after all. It barely made me laugh from the same trick, it does offer some insight to some magic tricks which I do not know of (say the coin into a cup trick) but otherwise... I did not laugh as much as I expected this to be. To end this, the closest reference I can bring myself to associate this series to is sadly, "Aho Girl". But now the surrounding topic is magic, and the style is very, very dry humour. "Aho Girl" is just stupid humour, but this one makes sure you only think about panties and boobs haha. So yeah, nice magic, but as one of the kids said in the park, "She's boring". <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I just feel bad for her now because she's going to do magic alone- Oh wait the sacrifice is there now I'M FREE lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s_CE1GRIr_4/XSqPb8x4z8I/AAAAAAAAypQ/S8g9QCeScmUQajTaZtXeIwbfI3QcBfBeACLcBGAs/s320/tejinasenpai02_trick.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">What this series makes you think it's like</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B4ajAEufhSk/XSqPdxpRiRI/AAAAAAAAypU/oqdvc8lzqFsqj_YnHCO86cSI0N58jRIkgCLcBGAs/s320/tejinasenpai02_assistant1.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">What this series actually is lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. The best part about this guy, the Assistant, is that he looks at the ecchi stuff so far and doesn't react or tell anyone about it. Now THAT is what I call personal entertainment lmao ok he did say it but she dumb af lol<br />P.P.S. I'll still watch the Twitter mini-series though because why not those are the real pros teaching Ede-chan (Hondo Kaede) and Rieri (Takahashi Rie) the real tricks which we might also not be able to see haha why can't they just spoil one trick and let us see them fail performing it? lol<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It's (my crotch) is still itchy!" Goddamn haha</div></blockquote>Kazusa don't you EVER say you want Pepperoni haha actually I think Hawaiian is also bad lmao (because... the taste of semen- I think I know too much lol) okay in this never-ending series of an episode (2) I can never stop joking on, "I'll die a virgin" might be the best summary to this episode to be honest. Okay, jokes aside, let's talk story. I mean, with such a cliffhanger of a first episode, it really makes me wonder what happened to this series, but I guess with this episode I may have a better idea, and I think&nbsp; might sit in for the ride. Firstly, Sugawara-san gets picked up. Hey, we be glad we are her, attractive and all, but yeah, not all of them are b*tches, to be frank. So yeah, coming from a theatre background, someone taught her to fight those people off. Thanks to help from Kazusa, they both had to act like they can't be f**ked ie. the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seibyou" target="_blank">STD</a> thing so that the guy will not approach her again. But as the girl said, it will come back to haunt her (not the itch lol) so yeah, this can only be but a temporary solution. I mean, is that how it is to be so attractive or are they just in the wrong neighbourhood? Talking about that, the girls in school continue to sh*t on Sonezaki as she fails to do the... (I don't know what you call that) that jump thing during PE, and people comment on her... I'm not going to repeat what they said. In perspective, she didn't say no or argue back, so that might be something to think about for us watchers. Closing in her relationship with... Amagi the guy who praised her looks last episode, the guy got to see for himself (us too tbh) how great she looks without that pair of glasses. Haha that's fun and all, which already makes you wonder what might have happened in the past. Yeah, that's going to be hell of a backstory waiting to hit us in the face, I tell you. Again, just look back at the title haha. Then, Izumi thinks he can stop Kazusa from thinking of whatever happened in his room. I mean, if it's not "esuibatsu" you can't stop a girl from thinking about it, but it's more for what is without. Someone tried to confess to the guy, and he said no. Okay, maybe. And it pissed the childhood friend off. She thinks that he might be thinking about "esuibatsu" all the time (the name is good but I'll have to put quotes on this lest you guys forgot they meant it as se-) but she is wrong, as mentioned by Sugawara later in the episode. Then again, also from Sugawara like as if she is surrounded by wise people, men don't think like this. Especially men who have done it alone. "Esuibatsu", I mean. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> To end it off, they let an epiphany hit Kazusa because... why would you ask about your childhood friend going out with girls when you keep thinking it's not with you? Because... yeah, you like the guy. And then you remember that he jerks off in his room watching porn (that scene popped up more times than I expected this episode tbh) and suddenly your crotch feels itchy lmao. Most importantly though, this episode ended with a heavy hit: the Literature Club is to be disbanded. Why? Mostly environmental reasons because I swear the Principal also does what Izumi did too but in his office lol, but that they don't have an advisor. So yeah, goodbye Lierature Club, you will be missed. Now get out there and get f**ked you maidens haha it's time to- Oh wait, it's not happening? I mean, we have already proven that half the girls have done it already, right? No? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Man, this series is as confusing as it's fast-paced, so I guess we shall see where this takes us. Hopefully not to hell but to some happy ending. Hey, I like 5 girls who can fall in love. Sadly for this series it might be in the manner of them getting laid. You know what I mean. Again, you can go ahead and do all those so long as I don't see it. Wait, really? Okay I changed my mind please don't do it just saying Izumi from first episode is enough haha please don't<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c6Ts_P5CJzk/XSqPpz-FpPI/AAAAAAAAypY/w_XoVU9EOL4dSVL6OxehmdK3ORduSNx3wCLcBGAs/s320/araoto02_agreement.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's like the G20 conference recently with the trade wars going on lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7kP0jtilTlg/XSqPsJx5qcI/AAAAAAAAypc/f0ss5Fb8rMQx1X5JKJpJy1mJMk6hNvuMACLcBGAs/s320/araoto02_kazusa3.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My reaction this whole epiosde and probably the rest of this series</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Finally, the role of reacting to stupid jokes lies in our hands now. Man, in this season full of idiots in the slice-of-life genre? It's making me tired just watching them haha. Why would I watch this though? <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Now that I think about it, maybe I shouldn't this is too tiring to watch haha where are all the romance shows?? Anyways, this show... man, how should I start. Comparing it to "Asobi Asobase" doesn't even give that show justice (but seriously that is way better than this one haha), but yeah, it's another stupid slice-of-life show that requires your fullest attention. Think like "Tejina Senpai" above but no one is doing the retortions ie. tsukkomi. Well there's Akane, for starters. I wish I have Tomacchan (Tomatsu Haruka) doing the tsukkomi to the jokes in my life (in absolute contrast to her role in Anime "WWW.WORKING!!!") (sorry for all the references here I gotta explain how bad this show is sorry) so I'd be satisfied, but hey, dealing with the one is enough. Then, there's Shiori, who is real smart just in first impression but then you'll notice she's a Biology nerd who keeps petri dishes in her bag. (You wanna sample my fluids anytime you now what I mean?) And then for the most part, we have the idiot. Again, there can only be one idiot in my brain for Anime, and I finished watching Anime "Aho Girl" not because of Yoshiko, so... Tanaka, you lost. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Ignoring all secondary characters including the one teacher who likes university girls ie. above 18 instead of high school girls (also known as JK), this show is filled with people who have... concrete goals in life. No really, even for Tanaka here too. Just that for her aspiration to get laid in high school especially in a girls' school, that is sadly not happening. How dumb can she get though? Your guess is as good as mine. As of this first episode which aired last week, only some of the characters are great (for example you remove Tanaka and this will be infinitely better haha), I personally dig the opening theme song in creativity (not the first time I heard of such a style), but otherwise you get a full-on sh*tshow that is going to make you cry because you'll need to take aspirin halfway through every episode. So yeah, twice every episode. For 12 of them. I hope your liver is ready. So yeah, I'm giving this up after all. Really, I want to laugh. And not to stupidity. I've gotten a good load of those years ago already and those are only 10 minutes long lol ugh I'm tired my head hurts<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SsBICWOmlyg/XSqQOilmV4I/AAAAAAAAyp0/DuVbw1JwoOsFuqTRogL6bHe0hvSfRoahgCLcBGAs/s320/mudazukai01_shock.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me after I watched this episode lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HLhtqvSTe1M/XSqQPimH4fI/AAAAAAAAyp4/Mft6Ge9ydqYqRO89R3swjXxKOOKrO6IzQCLcBGAs/s320/mudazukai01_jam.jpg" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Somehow Toyosaki Aki (who voices "Robo") is funny in this series haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "What is amazing is that you think you'll get popular if it's co-ed" Wow this burn is the biggest I've seen this season haha BURN<br />P.P.S. TIL there's a family name known as "Ninomae" My brain just got short-wired for like, 20 seconds lol you idiots watched Anime "Hitori Bocchi"?? lol (I'll take note this is a good naming... method? haha)<br />[TL;DR If you liked Anime "Pop Team Epic" this is the show for you I promise]<br /><br /><div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid var(--foreground); padding: 4px 8px;">[Update 2019.07.17: The thing that sucks about watching Anime on a Wednesday is that I'm tired from work everyday and I still have to be awake to watch this haiz why you not let me watch on Monday maybe we should put a previous episode review on watch in the weekend instead] <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">(quote)</div></blockquote>"Hey, Nishikata" That's the cue, guys. It's coming, the drop from our tease master. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this new episode (2) if I'm Nishikata I'll gladly get duped by Takagi-san in every turn haha. So yeah, this time there's more, but again, I like the focus on showing much affection from Takagi that the guy she likes will probably never understand. Again, Nishikata isn't that smart like all of us too, so... maybe give us better hints and stop bullying him? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I know, right? This social justice thing is only going to get me a friendship with the guy. That's it haha. Anyways, story. Firstly, it's the ice. (Nope, not that kind) Again, I live near the equator so ice is not a thing here for the past 20 odd years (and will never be), so I wouldn't understand how it feels to carry ice from puddles frozen on the ground. So yeah, Takagi takes a bet with Nishikata stating the following conditions: whoever brings the largest piece of ice to school wins, but immediately loses if dropped on the ground. So as expected, Nishikata took a large chunk off that puddle while Takagi takes enough such that in the case Nishikata drops it on the ground hers will still be big enough to take to school. (And that's why you shouldn't be dumb enough too to just take a piece smaller than your fingernail because it'll melt quick lol) Anyways, Takagi succeeded in letting Nishikata drop his piece of ice by telling about the punishment, and man, just imagining it is enough to make him drop. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So in return he has to warm her hands. With his hand warmer. What do you think it is? *laughhs* I would be dumb enough to just use my hands though but yeah Nishikata will just die of embarrassment, which is what happened next. The next morning, Nishikata told Takagi that he changed his appearance over the night, and asks her to figure out where. So too bad Takagi has a Masters Degree in logic (lol) while Nishikata has a Masters Degree in embarrassment lmao. Won't explain what happened as Takagi looks desperately around the guy she likes (or so we think) (haha think too much and you lose) and figured out it's his hair since this and nails are to be honest, the easiest things to change in appearance overnight. Idiot. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also, we got to shit on Yukari's poorly cut bangs (ie. That there is nothing left) too haha and Mina gets one in return. "Just to make myself feel better I'm going to sh*t on you" is the idea haha Yukari-chan you are starting to think like a me lol. Lastly, it's Valentine's Day. Wait, that soon? Happy Valentine's Day everybody haha. Besides Mina-chan who got her chocolate confiscated (for the school day at least) because she was handing it out blatantly in class (and the loner guys want it too) (including me haha), everyone else got their fair share. You know, from Mano-chan who tried to give her "book" back to Nakai (man, that was lovely to watch it's very <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kyun" target="_blank">kyun</a> and I like it) (also Nakai should not hang out with those friends who just blurt out romantic moments you jerks wait till you get one of those which is never BOOM haha) to Nishikata looking around the whole day to expect someone to give him chocolate (ie. Takagi) and did not get anything unti the end of the day in his shoe closet, still probably hasn't figured out whether (1) it's from the girl or (2) if it's <a href="https://jisho.org/search/honmei" target="_blank">honmei</a> or <a href="https://jisho.org/search/giri" target="_blank">giri</a>. Get f**ked, Nishikata. And once again, Takagi-san, you are not going to get laid at this rate tbh <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, they two better off than me already haha sadded maybe next episode won't be this sad for me lol<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-11K01XDRTq4/XS8uVQQLYsI/AAAAAAAAyt8/MBpg3EuemewMljxGED2VlV282eDv7o6nQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_tickle.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This guy is so lucky he doesn't even know haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--FYE2DTDpUM/XS8uWyrSNQI/AAAAAAAAyuA/0SpTR9txJBM-ac6Qrm028U-G7cyby89JgCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_hand.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This guy is so lucky he doesn't even know haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Now that I notice I'm actually as dumb as Nishikata or just slightly smarter than him so I'm&nbsp; not going to do that "Karakai Kaihi" thing I did in season one I'm sorry Nishikata you may be dumb but it's pot calling kettle here haha<br />[Lastly, I would like to say I like the flow of the series so far. From seeing Mano-chan give chocolate to that immediate cut of the guys who still got nothing haha man they are really making this better than season one and I LIKE IT haha here's a GIF just becasue]<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ssdkFS7W1s8/XS8wQCKUK6I/AAAAAAAAyuM/sgDsjf94rHg8vJ96qBy0nvhyU_0e-_CEwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS202_laughing.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is me when I have to laugh at someone haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>Êº´Áîª</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kuroshitsuji</span></div></blockquote>Wow it has been some time, so let's catch up on what happened after the drop. (Eh, still using "Ciel Ciel" as the original since Chapter 1, and "Other Ciel" as the one in the house now) In the latest chapters (151-153), we continue on what happened after Ciel Ciel had to escape due to his brother's "revival". Oh well, that aside, but yes, Other Ciel is living the damn live in literally what was the reconstructed Phantomhive mansion, alone with Tanaka and the Undertaker. That's it. So yeah, they'll need to staff up, to say the least. Also, he visited his relatives and trolled the sh*t out of them about being back alive, but hey, they gotta believe it. We also got a little insight into Ciel Ciel's plans after Other Ciel took over his position. Man, that was quite the steal, but human mind are to be believed on the return of a dead person through Shinigami powers than the one who has survived the ordeal... albeit through a demon. Hey, both are evil, so whatever haha. Anyways, Meirin and Ran are hired in a mansion up North of town, and of course, despite suspicion, they are hired. Of course they can't be there to do house chores only since Meirin can hardly do anything but kill people lol, so that's that. But before they are to be found out, they, like the other 6 people involved here in Ciel Ciel's group, have a mission: to find out if any blood-drawing activities exist within the grounds. And if so, it must be eliminated to technically cut off Other Ciel's supplies because technically that boy is a vampire now haha. So yeah, sure is abrupt, but this will be exciting than any other arcs ever, so I wish this will have an awesome conclusion. Some screw-ups are bound to happen, but if it is what it takes to take revenge... before Ciel Ciel could take revenge for the Phantomhive family, then so be it. Hey, no one said there aren't cheating. All of them. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="436" data-original-width="835" height="167" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FVLw3Fr9m-I/XSrgsGLJ_WI/AAAAAAAAyqY/CDOXtK3hXzQnQJmB9BdWkxu_O39ID2UuACLcBGAs/s320/152_12.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I <i>knew </i>the housekeeper was lesbian lol<br />(Also, thanks for fanservice hehe)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S. The Aurora Society is so big, if you forgot your greeting pose you need to watch that Campaignia movie arc haha<br /><br />(Note to self: I'm skipping reviews on Dagashi Kashi and Nagasarete Airantou since the former is too short even for 2 chapters and the latter... just showed me tits wtf)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>Èü≥Ê•Ω</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week... hey we got new releases to listen to, so that's good. Not that they are awesome, so I topped them up with a couple more releases just in case haha. <b>Horie Yui's new album</b> should be a highlight considering her previous was 4 years ago and I only gave one song, this one proved to be impressive in contrast. I think I missed her singing haha. Anyways, I started with what was only the album topic song (music video on YouTube btw) and then ended up giving an emotional song and... hey Kiyoshi Ryujin (composer of Sumipe's latest single topic song btw) we meet yet again turns out I can't resist your work. So yeah, Hocchan wins this week haha. <b>Amamiya Sora's new single</b> is okay, I'll give the topic song because this is the closest to her getting caught and tied up (if you watched the music video haha) but the B-side was not impressive. Hey, you gotta be like Mocho she's on a roll recently with Anime theme songs haha. (Yes, I meant it as a joke it's pure coincidence and MusicRayn's hard at work) I also took a listen to <b>Cidergirl's latest single</b> by giving these guys a chance again after many times missing the target, I think I can give a B-side, to be honest. The Chinese love phrase references may be too much, but I'll deal with it since the melody is catchy. All in all, a fun week to listen songs to. It's not a lot, but Hocchan filled in the gaps hehe<br /><br />Next week on schedule brings us... nothing. Yeah, I get to take a brek again, I guess. Maybe it is time to go listen to new songs out there if I'm not too busy with work and fixing this site for the 27th time this month lmao<br /><br />On Twitter news, I'm hooked to <b>ChiCO with HoneyWork's new song</b> for Anime "Araoto", somehow also to whatever hip-hop song <b>opening theme for "Mudazukai"</b> (reviews above btw), <b>ClariS' new cover album</b> of oldies include that one song I have heard the most number of times for the duration of Klassic Note (if you wonder it's "secret base ~Kimi ni Kureta Mono~" if you haven't heard it before your listening experience is not long enough haha), and I heard a short of <b>Porno Graffitti's new song</b> in a TV program live... it's okay? I'll probably give it anyways maybe<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><div dir="ltr" lang="ja">„Äê‰ªäÈÄ±„Å´Apple Music„Äë<br />„Åª„Å£„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì4Âπ¥„Å∂„Çä„ÅÆ„Ç¢„É´„Éê„É†„ÄÅ„Åæ„Åü‰ø∫„ÅÆÈùíÊò•„Å´ÈÄ£„Çå„Å¶Ë°å„Åè„Çì„Å†„ÄÇ<br /><br />„Åú„Å≤„ÄÅ17Ê≠≥„ÅÆÂ†ÄÊ±üÁî±Ë°£„Å´ÔΩóÔΩó<a href="https://t.co/LUvtHlEqJl">https://t.co/LUvtHlEqJl</a></div>‚Äî Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1148757517289193472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 10, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>(*It means the same thing as <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1148759196487172096?s=20" target="_blank">the English one</a> btw, just slightly different in expression) (Notice the one Like there hehe)<br />Before I end, I think you may have noticed I... I guess it's a beta test? I tweeted "This Week on Apple Music" - a thing I do to introduce on time releases in Apple Music on Twitter... in Japanese. Yes, those shall be my 2nd and 3rd tweets considering Hocchan's album and AyumiKurikaMaki's mini-album released this week. And I'm glad that one Japanese understood what I typed; it makes me feel like I've achieved something in life already haha Internet life I mean<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it I guess. And yep, I guess I got to start early so I can end early so that's good. Work, I mean. Well I'm done for now, and then I gotta do it again tomorrow, so wish me luck. I was looking through the Anime's Twitter account, and you know abou the CHiCO thing above? Yea, she is doing a <a href="https://twitter.com/araotoproject/status/1149241919953920002?s=20" target="_blank">mini-series for the Anime</a> as a radio DJ level love consultant? (Sugawara was the guest/caller btw) Haha that's more fun than my job to say the least BOOM GOT ME. <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Cya guys next week then, and until then... at least I'm happy playing all those mobile games Animal Crossing New Horizons please come quick I want a Stardew Valley sequel haha bye everyone ie. me<br /><br />P.S. Okay now that I sorted out my release list schedule at least there's Ohara Yuiko's new single for Anime "Takagi-san" to give. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> I'm not that excited now lol sorry not sorry<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
