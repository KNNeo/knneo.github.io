<h2 class="title">The Entertainment News 2019 Edition Issue #29 - Anime Extra</h2>

<img id="news-thumbnail" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-THoiOfcckPw/XTW8L5ANMZI/AAAAAAAAy2Y/6WH_84Uy4ncTfdwbrM07aqiUV-PSW9KEwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS203_eyebrows.gif" style="display: none;" /><div id="hashtags"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#jyoshimuda</a> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#takagisan</a></div>Well, I guess it's Monday then. The Dark Soul forced me to finish this today lol<br /><br />And yes, it has been a while. Welcome back to another Anime Extra, where we try to pick up whatever we missed last week and not have to wait until the following week to watch them. Sadly this will be the only one this Anime season because from next issue I'll shift Takagi-san to a week late ie. this weekend you won't hear of it until the following week. Yeah, Takgi-san, you hear that? I'm not going to lose to you just because you tell me to watch the Anime. I'll lose to you in scissors paper stone though man <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.Jorudan.ARTakagisan" target="_blank">that new mobile app</a> is the best game ever haha more on that later<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Damn you, Takagi-san. Teasing me as soon as we meet up?" Ah that's called flirting you idiot lmao</div></blockquote>To be honest the only salvation to this show about getting screwed by a middle schooler is the victim's imagination ie. Nishikata haha thanks bro I owe you a lot lol. In this new episode (3) if you're alone in anywhere with a girl... you shouldn't want to end it fast. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Ah, my youth lmao. Anyways, Nishikata blah blah whatever, let's start with some more funny stories haha. Firstly, a trip to the <a href="https://jisho.org/search/dagashiya" target="_blank">candy store</a>. Well, not like Takagi would know (Nishikata you idiot), but yeah, it's also April Fool's Day then. Not that we will get fooled because clearly the joke was done like, 3 months ago, but suffice it to say that Nishikata thought that bringing a girl to an empty location would be fun. Again, young boy, that is not how you treat a girl. You want to grow up? Be more like a gentleman. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, the store is open by the way haha (guess the old man didn't want to rest that day), so the couple get to have some sweets, probably from most of Nishikata's monthly allowance because he loses all the time lol. And since Takagi found him out, she decided to be honest on the day of lies, and encouraged Nishikata to do so. And that is when she know she can ask some questions she can never ask normally haha. Man, she really is smart, this girl. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> I guess the most important question is asking if he wants to still sit beside her, and... I mean he won't say no, but I'll say yes. Notice the differences btw one is said by an idiot lol. They later also joined the cherry blossom viewing session with the other girls, so that's kinda fun hearing them talk about life. Man, it's so real I can't even. (Again, if you didn't anticipate Mina-chan's face at the other end of the bikini shot you are dumber than Nishikata lol) Lastly, it's about going up the ranks. You know there can only be that many years we can talk about this series, so yeah, Takagi-san's grown older. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> As for Nishikata... I guess he's still as childish as ever. Never thought I'll use this word to describe him, but here we are. So yeah, dropping honorifics isn't much of a thing here since we only use them in formal language, but in Japan it's quite important. It's a matter of respect versus politeness, and they are still different than being insulting. So yeah, I would never get used to the boy dropping honorifics since... the... title... haha but yeah Takagi-san if you want to call your dear boy Nishikata I wouldn't stop you lmao. And I think I can say this again just like season 1 (of not 100% Kataomoi lol) that: Just be boring, and Takagi will leave you alone. Be serious and focus on your studies, and you'll be a good citizen someday. Be rude, so Takagi will be thrown off and be scared of the real you lmao. Yeah, just describing myself btw haha cya guys next week I can talk about Kyunko every week lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ifv7FN3KU2I/XTW3ktPGpTI/AAAAAAAAy18/mCPCvlXFZwEvYbja61YdsA4B_NPSU0ovQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS203_seats.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">YOU F**KED THIS YEAR TOO YO NISHIKATA haha<br />(That's their seating arrangements btw)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TFrnX4stJKA/XTW3nTZsd9I/AAAAAAAAy2A/0DDQgmNBrJkds6APWAXMID-qIDgBgC1MwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS203_cry.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Petitioning for "Karakai Jouzu no Nishikata-kun" because this is actually fun to watch hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "Let's talk normally, since we're alone together" How to pick up a guy 101 lmao why am I learning this from a girl haha<br />P.P.S. Once again proving, with this episode, that Nishikata is a "too-pure-pure boy" haha I can't stop making that Kannagi reference I'm sorry<br />[Another GIF because Mina-chan's reactions in this series are the best haha Takagi if the above petition gets passed lol]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2OpR5s2aNl8/XTW4bJihy-I/AAAAAAAAy2M/l_WqGggQqaMG6RR8tAzeXADwChDFkdNTACLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS203_eyecatch2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Troll level max out, this one</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-THoiOfcckPw/XTW8L5ANMZI/AAAAAAAAy2Y/6WH_84Uy4ncTfdwbrM07aqiUV-PSW9KEwCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS203_eyebrows.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW I have to be smug about something which is never haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Joshikousei no Mudazukai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"You're the only one (woman) who is sulking over not having a chest full of hair" Yeah, it's kinda amazing, that idiot haha</div></blockquote>So yeah, we're back for another episode. I just need to take a while to take it all in. Last episode, I mean. That doesn't mean this one wouldn't be better haha. (I mean, what's with the GoPro-like setup in the intro?) Hey author (or Bino-sensei), if you think something is amazing and we think it's not, please give it to Tanaka so that we don't all go crazy and make sure Akane gets a shot at shitting on it too lmao. Man, this show in a nutshell haha. This episode (3) we talk about someone's grandma. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Man, even the obaa-chan had to go along with that idiot and do the tsukkomi stuff haha everyone is tired in this show because of her. Not Loli, by the way. Didn't expect an episode on her though, because you know, I don't really like people who look like kids. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Okay, hear me out. But then again it's not about that you can't tell a story with things I dislike, so I guess we are here to know more about her. Sadly, through the eyes of the trio. The duo is fine, just burn whoever that idiot is, please? Anyways, story. We hear a heartwarming story about Loli (well Saku-chan is not cute enough so the nickname will do haha) and her grandma, it seems, and yeah, it's more than just her being a little girl. I mean, it's high school life already, but this kid is somehow still stuck in elementary school, maybe out of love for the elderly, but maybe because it's to keep up an image which, even now, is sticking with her and probably affecting her lifestyle in general. (I mean, don't sound vulgar and you'll be loved even if it's just the loli lol) Hey, I wouldn't say that's how you get bullied in school, but this is a girls' school and people in Anime "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/154708/Megumi_Takagi" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Lion</a>" or "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/149848/Atsumi_Imori" target="_blank">Demi-chan</a>" don't exist (lol sorry for the lack of descriptions but you can guess who they are in person from context here), so at least she won't be insulted because of her physique. Then again, there's Tanaka nearby ready to fire those shots as soon as she sees her, even if it's just in a supermarket outside of town lol. Trying not to be tempted by toys and/or sweets, Loli barely escaped the clutches of Evil Boss Tanaka only to realise she ended up buying a box of chocolate. Yeah, only one, mom, only one. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (And that's why they shouldn't sell those in boxes you're already causing trouble for parents lol) Surprisingly, the grandma didn't get disappointed but instead made some hamburger using tofu, in case you don't know how vegetarian meat is made nowadays. (Goddamn that lever thing on Tanaka was a highlight to say the least) Fast forward to a day with gym class, and Loli forgot to bring her clothes. So doing the most matured thing ever, she... <strike>waited for her grandma to bring her</strike> asked for one from the students in the nearby class, making the old woman relieved that she might have just grown up. In return, she had a conversation with that idiot and also told us the story behind her and the grandmother: She was staying with her because her parents were migrating to Germany. Yeah, great way to leave your kid behind, idiot parents. Not talking about you, Tanaka. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all, didn't expect a touching story here (you bet I teared up), but I hope these kinds of stories don't last long really I need things like Aki-chan sounding erotic and making weird noises in the bathroom not sad knees-cannot-bend tales HAHAHAHAHAHA (there are 2 references for this in this very show now lmao) this show is so screwed already even at three episodes someone piggyback me to the final episode please<br />[SORRY NOT SORRY LOLI BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THUMBNAILS THIS WEEK~]<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EaDoavZHmMs/XTXHMYXsQtI/AAAAAAAAy2k/HMo0WPblzAkAFydIXgHVmnpSFx6Z6ohjACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda03_yamai.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">MFW I have constipation and try to do it in the shitter lmao</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZvXQ6Nxtn08/XTXHNAkmtBI/AAAAAAAAy2o/lj0oG4sZbfsImKkduOsyDpTGO2Miv0nBACLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda03_hug.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I want some comforting girl's chest to cuddle when I'm scared I don't care if it's hairy lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "... Your house is going to be the only place that Santa won't visit this year!" O...kay, kido, we know you love old people haha<br />P.P.S. OKAY NOW I WANT TO HEAR TOMACCHAN DO MATH PLEASE MAKE HER DO IT lmao and I'm not talking about the multiplication time tables btw *looks at Minase Inori*<br />[I like how Loli is crying on the streets because she childish af but she still has to make her way home realising that she is too old to stand there and cry all day lol]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Okay I'm done laughing at these idiots haha maybe I'm the sadist laughing at these imbeciles and enjoying my elitist life. *sips on Starbucks cold brew* Ah, my headache is going away already, slowly but surely. Cya guys next time then, and hopefully by then.... you will come back for an extra post this week. If I don't post one before Sunday this week then you lose haha bye gotta go lose to Takagi-san at rock paper scissors<br /><br />P.S. It's a mobile app, and all you do is to play against a randomised AI. No joke, hints will not change the random outcome, I promise. I played the whole afternoon at work already. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> And it has a gacha and it's filled with in-app purchases. Good luck someone unlocking the AR photo shoot mode by "losing" 20 times in a row haha they knew this was coming now it's time to earn all the money back "What, how do you think the 2nd season got lit?" haha<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
