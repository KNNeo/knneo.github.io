<h2>The Entertainment News 2019 Edition Issue #1</h2>
Okay this week is going to be the most boring week here ever so I'll make a short post on this one. Also, I've not planned to revamp this column just yet until maybe next week so we shall see about that lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>漫画</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Dagashi Kashi</span></div></blockquote>The new (translated) chapter (135) things got real serious. Yeah, like asking about your past serious lol. Kokonotsu didn't understand the meaning of "mother's taste" and... I guess You-san is trying to avoid the conversation because the kid didn't have a mother now. She left the family, apparently. So is Hajime-san, who was instructed to not talk about it with him. Hotaru, however, has other opinions. Well, she kind of nicely mentioned about what it is even though I don't think that is it (imo mother's taste refers to her cooking if I'm not wrong) and also jogged Kokonotsu's memory a bit. Is the next arc about the mother? Wow now you're getting me hooked. Also, new season Anime material right there haha<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="468" data-original-width="652" height="229" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u3mZY9cFJqw/XDINsLf-l6I/AAAAAAAAtCU/0tcmcgH3Pc8Wi4FlqPwSy-5ENi499HJugCLcBGAs/s320/1351.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">TFW your wife left you and your kid asks such a question lol</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>I didn't do much this opening week in Klassic Note. Well, the opening week is next week so now I'm just finding songs to put in the new list for now to start with an initial set of songs, and <b>SHE'S seems to be quite a candidate</b> from the couple of artists I listened to just today haha. <b>fhana's best album</b> wasn't that interesting as usual so I might just give their newest song a chance if I'm in the mood. SHE'S and their previous album was okay, so I might want to give a couple. Some of them have the vibes from their latest single which made quite a scene in Klassic Note last year.<br /><br />Next week brings us a couple of singles to start the year and Klassic Note, namely <b>Aimer's new single</b>, <b>Kotobuki Minako's new single</b>, and <b>yanaginagi's best albums</b> which I hope I'll be able to hear it firsthand on Apple Music. We shall see. Otherwise I may just rummage the Internet to make a cheap compilation myself without the new songs maybe lol. Or I can just listen to some indie artists while I wait. Been some time since I visited Audioleaf, to be honest.<br /><br />On Twitter over the new year, many news were announced. <b>Ikimonogakari announced their return</b> with a new digital single to start the year, the <b>Anime "Bungou Stray Dogs" got their theme songs confirmed</b> (more concerned about the awesome new season) (happening next season though), <b>NEGOTO announced their disbandment</b> as mentioned in the Artists Evaluation post if you didn't notice and I hope they'll end with a release of sorts please, and <b>many artists are included for review on their releases for upcoming months</b> including SHE'S, FINLANDS, Hanazawa Kana, Natsukawa Shiina and so on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That shall be it then. If you want to read more text or help me proof read lol you can head to the Artists Evaluation post to see how the artists in Klassic Note 2018 fared. Mostly not good haha. Cya guys next week then, and hopefully then I can ask Kaguya-sama out on a date haha you idiot if you don't I'll do it hehe bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
