<div class="header"></div>
What do you mean I only watch Anime and listen to five songs?? I'm taking all these seriously, people! Don't laugh at my hobbies!!<br /><br />Oh well, no one's here anyways, and I like sh**ting on myself, so welcome back, nobody. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span><br /><br />...<br /><br /><span title="*sigh*">ðŸ˜©</span> Let's start haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: start;">"Is this what you meant by you have adult things to deal with??" Yeah Natsuo, I guess. Yeah. Why not, right?? *drama intensifies*</span></div></blockquote>I like how she says she doesn't do little boys and here we are. Looks like Hina-chan just does anyone who wants her. Thank goodness the friend doesn't know about it in the cafe or else... lol okay let's focus and not get distracted, yes? So many things to talk about in this new episode (3) I don't even know where to start. I know it's all centering around the one issue which is Hina-chan's relationship with her partner now, but spoilers first if you need to skip it: she's in an affair. Yes, it's those type in which she is not the wife. You get what I mean here now. Problem is that even when she got found out, she still insists that she is right, and explains it to the inexperienced and/or kids like they don't know what it means to like someone who is already married. Hey Hina-chan just not to kill your hopes again as another inexperienced, but normally these stuff don't go well. Unless you're assuming the wife will retreat, she's not going to let their marriage go without a fight. Not based on drama or real life experience, by the way. And you don't need to feel to know. So yeah, Hina-chan lived with that reality, when people around her actually noticed her life has changed from being her usual bubbly self to now worried about everything in between and depressed even. And that probably came to a standpoint when Natsuo decided (probably in the benefit of himself and also, being a stepbrother) to confront her about the stuff he heard from his friend who works at the nearby cafe. That, and Hina-chan taught him a lesson? Sure, who cares man. "You know I f**ked your sister, right?" <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Well she doesn't know yet, so let's leave that at that. Ironically, Rui-chan decides to join the rebellion following Natsuo's departure from home, mistakenly believed by the parents as opposition of their marriage even though we're talking about another marriage that has pretty much nothing to do with this family until you notice Hina-chan's in it lol. (Wow, long sentences pro, me) The author did think of a backup plan in case this leaving of the house thing exists though, as Natsuo's friend was kind enough to lend some shelter for the two who left in protest of Hina-chan's relationship with a married man. All in all, it probably did impact Hina-chan more than the parents I hope, and whether that will change anything will depend on what the trio talked about at the friend's house that the two are potentially about to execute. I mean, dad, if you really want to talk about it let's talk about it. That's... the vibes I'm feeling for next episode haha. As a final word, I'm not saying Hina-chan shouldn't be with someone she loves, but I would argue that if it hurts you in the end it's going to hurt the people around you more. That, and the other woman in this relationship who we do not know of. Let's see where this goes then, Sasuga-sensei. You have made me very invested in this show with the drama drops and occasional jokes lol the friend MVP this episode<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gtrBeuxfOag/XE1MEwNTS8I/AAAAAAAAteg/0c2Vdd7FFqgU3sF-KxF2Y_xLvya5IQiwACLcBGAs/s320/domekano03_natsuo.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This episode we didn't have Rui-chan half faced so this idiot would do lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HFufbAG0Mho/XE1ME0CFXlI/AAAAAAAAtek/LA7QMF8dO3YAAf_iRrQN6gW9j4pnGjKewCLcBGAs/s320/domekano03_rui2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Because this has been trending on Twitter and I like it too so... ara kawaii</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. That's jealousy? I think it's not really that because I'm just a caring family member who just wants to help you out in your relationship- I hope you guys breakup quickly so I can go out with you and make you happy lol &lt;= not Natsuo<br />P.P.S. You told someone else who is in a different school about our relationship so that's okay? Haha Rui-chan you good girl you. Also, be glad he didn't tell the friend how much you were moaning in that- HE TOLD HIM THAT TOO?? <a href="https://jisho.org/search/korosu" target="_blank">KOROSU</a> lmao<br />[Again, that end card...

I mean, look at the ending song lol. Okay, before all that let's talk about the new episode (3) which really shortened that intro so that I have no excuse to reject this so far entertaining series. Because why? They are talking about the stories we've been waiting for since the beginning. All of them. Let's talk about it. Firstly, is "the first time". I mean, I did mention this before but, Kaguya is always going to lose out because there's one thing that differentiates her from the others in terms of experience, and that is commoner understanding. Coming in from a rich family background, learning some of these may be prohibited to some extent, and so, can lead to misunderstandings or even segregation when the time comes for her to acutally put that knowledge into use. So yeah, thank goodness Chika-chan did explain to her what that means. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Yes, kids. It's just kissing haha. Although I would argue that many like me have not actually expressed love to their family at the least on this part, so yeah Kaguya-sama you're technically correct haha but it's not what everyone else meant so you lose. Secondly, a test about Kaguya-sama. Well, they didn't explain on how it should be played, but it's a good guess from Miyuki. Of course, if you didn't notice that 20-question yes-no game which shortened into half the length was just a plot for Kaguya to test Miyuki on getting him to say "is it me?" or anything close to it resulting in an indirect confession (not true because of last episode lol KABEDAN haha) so yeah Mikyuki was smart enough to evade it. Now that, I call it a brain battle. Truly lives up to the sub title of this series. That, and I think Miyuki probably has a better understanding of Kaguya's potentially evil but tsundere nature which will make him be more cautious of this rich girl in the future lol. Lastly, so sentimental a story even I'll savour it for ages. Kaguya decides to walk to school today. Well, she normally doesn't, and if not for that cat which <strike>she placed in the engine</strike> was in the engine in the morning she would have not done otherwise, but thanks butler for letting her go alone we'll reserve an episode for you haha. And of course, along the way things must happen for her to (1) be late and (2) not be able to execute her plan of seeing Miyuki on his way to school who is possibly late because why, the Student Council President cannot be late?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, it's a simple story about a kid scared to go to school alone (OMG did you see that Yeti crossing the road?? For a moment I thought what would happen lol) and would love to go to school with friends. Things that Kaguya wants but didn't have. I mean, friends to go to school with. Not this time it wouldn't be. By some sweet coincidence, Miyuki spotted her, they both are late for different reasons, and Kaguya gets to fetch a ride to school on his bicycle. Sweet. So sweet I'm afraid I'll get diabetes. Good thing Kaguya is savouring it slowly every time she sees kids walk to school inside her car. But man, ain't that a lovely story. Can we end the series now? And make this into a short movie? Can we?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Thanks  again production for everything thus far, because I'm actually impressed and am able to understand the reasons behind all what this was done for, from the narrations to the plot advancement thus far. Not <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1089175125105303553" target="_blank">the ending theme song</a> this episode though; you trying to sell Chika-chan for fanservice, Aniplex?? (Can see that A1 Pictures you're trying to test your <a href="https://twitter.com/tettun_2525/status/1089180063923240960" target="_blank">newly designed 3D animation rendering</a>, but still) (When you thought they couldn't top that opening theme song)&nbsp;Seriously though, this gonna be in the soundtrack?

Really giving new songs. Hey, Apple Music Japan is good at recommending new songs from artists that I know. That, or I just listen to my past songs playlist and reminded myself to check on their new releases lol. We start with <b>vivid undress new mini-album</b> which was actually good due to their two topic songs, but then again I didn't get to hear the full album until the weekend (ugh why you all like that I got Apple Music man) and... I think I can give more. Hey, they are one of those bands I wanna give more Rock music on, no joke. <b>Minase Inori's new single</b> was okay, I liked the topic song for whatever Anime it's in, and... maybe not the B-sides whatever haha. <b>Fuchigami Mai's new mini-album</b> has been on the list for review since last year, but man was it hard to give a decision. I assume it was subjection from my side to give that one topic song #ForFanservice so yeah Mai-chan this one song is it. Not your fault, just saying. (I mean, she either sings hyped up Anime songs which aren't as good as Kawada Mami or it's this lol) I also gave <b>Fujifabric's new album</b> a listen which did not include that collaboration single from last year, but overall I gave one song which impressed me, on impulse. I'll do it. Desperation makes me want to "get it on" real quick haha<br /><br />Next week I'll be reviewing a couple of things. Releasing on the week itself will be <b>minami's debut single</b> from the Anime "DomeKano" (see above before Kaguya-sama) (yes it's the abbreviation for the series) and... I hope I can give this single. minami-san, I want to give you songs. Don't rap the whole song through, yes? I'll also be listening to <b>Tsuji Shion's best album</b> to see if I can put it on my shelf (as of now it's a no) and <b>SIX LOUNGE's first album</b> from like two years ago and see if I can give something else other than their punk rock music. Their emotional songs are pretty good, which was what I gave last year on their latest mini-album. The recent slew of rock festival videos was the motivation for this one.<br /><br />On Twitter this week in case you don't like following my Twitter because I follow two games which I like to join their retweet campaigns in lol,&nbsp;<b>SCANDAL's new single</b> is releasing in March following their shift to new label company under Victor (you don't have to know what happened anyways I'm industry veteran-speaking here), <b>KANA-BOON is ready for another Anime theme song</b>, and <b>Aimer is releasing her 5th album</b> in April, excuse me, albums. On other things not on Twitter, <b>Asakura Momo's new music video preview</b> is out, and... I mean, if you like her I'm not stopping you because the song isn't... I'll get over it during Valentine's haha.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Wow took me some time before I even finished writing the Klassic Note stuff above. Been watching someone play Resident Evil 2 for the whole day. 7 hour gameplay, by the way. And there's technically four playthroughs. Well, cya guys next week then, and hopefully by then I'll have the mood to collect red packets haha hey it's all for the pizza delivery order the three of us had just now hehe #NormalPeopleLife Is this what the Japanese refer to as "riajuu"?? I'm feeling it haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
