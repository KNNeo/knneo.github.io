<h2>The Entertainment News 2019 Edition Issue #25</h2>
<div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#senkosan</a> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#straydogs</a> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#aochan</a> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">#joshikausei</a></div>If you noticed a bunch of posts recently and maybe later, do not be surprised because those packages, they comin' haha<br /><br />So yeah, you should've noticed but I'll mention it later, I did a Klassic Note Review yesterday which should be done on Friday but the postman came at a wrong time so I had to go take it myself the next morning.<br /><br />Another week of entertainment, another week of awesome content, to say the least. I don't know what is in store for next season yet because I'm waiting for that season preview, so if you want to be patient with me I'll talk about it next week hopefully. Let's talk about two shows which ended this week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Today is going to be rough" I mean, as long as it's not Nakano getting fired we're good haha</div></blockquote>Hey Nakano, like really, consider a career change yet? *laughs* Ah then again it's probably not easy to get a job in Japan so I won't say too much. In this new episode (11) the omen is arriving. No, not meteor strikes, but yeah, something bad is about to happen, it seems. Firstly, Nakano gets drunk. Haha, not the bad thing we're going to talk about though, because the one guy had a great time drinking at his own place, so that's probably good. What's not good is that, despite all this petting from Senko-san it still seems that Nakano's worries aren't relieved anytime soon. Huh. I guess that's how modern society works now. All this pampering won't work anymore haha hmm is that so. Anyways, that is least of his worries because next up, he got complained by the boss for not spending his paid leave. Hey, same here, and I must say MC is also paid leave so why not take more lol (I don't btw so you do you), but yeah, even this he can get reprimanded on. On a personal standpoint I hate the company he works for haha. But yeah, many things can happen since he has the time off too. Sadly, it's about the father. Is it what... Sora-san (I just forgot her name lol) that demigod told him spot-on? Maybe, but yeah, it's not that bad. But yeah, since he has the time now he chose to go back hometown to see the family too, as much as he would like to spend time with Senko-san to go walk supermarkets. (Haha do your parents know there's a fox living at your place? lol) On the other hand, I wouldn't say this is a bad thing, but Senko-san is leaving. Why though? We will know soon enough probably. I wouldn't argue it's leaving though, but she may have to go somewhere else. Somewhere, she cannot bring Nakano's phone with her. Hey, I don't suppose she is reporting to some superior though 'cos for some hierachy of a business she isn't in that is just sad if she has to do that haha. I doubt Sora-san wants her back this fast, but it has already been a year, Nakano is still as sad as he is coping with his work life outside of town, so... exactly what went wrong? We might be able to get that answer soon though, as next week we shall see what surprises will make this show even worth recommending haha like seriously I'm not that interested in looking at a man enjoying himself I want it to be me! lmao<br /><div class="popup"><span class="initial"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8rJfvrKglTM/XQ8ftuPYbAI/AAAAAAAAyCQ/9eTiIhg0ucU4hc4DlU8LICkZuAF1_ICRQCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan11_happy.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Happiness is...</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jpjvllpn_DI/XQ8fui-lodI/AAAAAAAAyCU/vsyHr6dIbl4Tr1mmddnTf2mN-0CGljAlQCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan11_flashback.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is the kind of stereotypical Anime flashback where they don't tell you what it means and it'll always remain a mystery dammit (God moves in mysterious ways, I guess)</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S. Thank goodness they put in the age warning to tell us Senko-san's age is above legal instead of letting you think she is underage haha this show man<br />P.P.S. If you need some vocabulary learning so you can learn with me, the banner of Senko-san Iyazaka is referred to as <a href="https://jisho.org/search/noren" target="_blank">noren</a> and <a href="https://jisho.org/search/chikuzenni" target="_blank">chikuzenni</a> is... something to eat haha I promise<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungo Stray Dogs Season 3</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">So Fukuzawa is better than Gin? *laughs* No sir don't kill my imouto- Okay at least, Akutagawa's imouto lol</div></blockquote>And that is what happens with information technology, Mori Ougai. Gather too much and people will want to kill you for it. Well, it's mostly court cases nowadays, but the similarity is too real tbh. In this new episode (36) we get to see more fighting!!! HELL YEAH pure power vs Elise-chan I've been waiting for this since I was born- Oh no, that's it? FLASHBACK!! Haha yes, we go back 12 years ago to see what the two leaders look like back then. With respect to that, we are introduced to a new character who will be pivotal to playing this game of chess, and it looks like the tables can be easily turned apparently, so that's good. Firstly, what happened back then. Mori Ougai was an underground world doctor as we have known, and Fukuzawa is a top rated assassin from the government. He's so good, you can't even see him kill. But under someone's orders, Fukuzawa was to help out Mori Ougai so he gets protected from underworld threats. Why though? Because it was part of a plan. A plan to protect this city they all loved. And thus, cue the Detective Agency's cat and former Ability user retiree and the <b>real</b> badass, Natsume Souseki. This guy, man. You don't know how long I have to wait for this reveal, because <b>clearly</b> these two are just dogs to someone higher haha. Anyways, the plan was to allow the government to oversee the day, Port Mafia to oversee the night, and the Detective Agency to see in between, for the protection of this city called Yokohama. So far so good I suppose, but Mori isn't wrong in that the twilight part isn't exactly necessary, although it wasn't further explained because the cat got angry haha. So yeah, he told his two underlings (haha) to wise up and fight back since by now Fyodor is just waiting for these two to die, stuck under his bunker (as expected) so he won't accidentally get killed in this lol. Anyways, counterattack. Atsushi and Akutagawa took on the task (it was Dazai haha) to infiltrate the enemy territory filled with all the traps even Dazai would be proud of lol, but yeah, those two idiots got to go in first. Well, it was quite smooth in progression until they all noticed the one guy Akutagawa threatened to kill was the virus Ability user! Man, talking about plot twists. This show is amazing, man. Giving us treats in every corner. However this also means it may just be the beginning because Akutagawa is hit by a virus, and Atsushi is probably the only one who will be able to stop the Ability user. Then again, in agitation much could screw up, so I'm going to hold my breath until next week. Man, no action show has ever made me this interested since... well quite some time, I believe. Here's to a awesome ending for this season, to say the least. Is this the end of the seires, though? I hope not. This city is so much fun, it'll be sad to see it die.<br /><div class="popup"><span class="initial"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o-HG-etT7vE/XQ8qVVoQreI/AAAAAAAAyCk/FwPDvz6tzUMIC_NzNE_0Ee6um1PmuV2ZgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs36_natsume2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Didn't realise badass looked like this until this episode</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hyn4mZnS00Y/XQ8qWN12stI/AAAAAAAAyCo/3dwoIK7cgwoxpcouTiQYHAsFIL9FiqsKwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs36_elise2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Okay this is pretty badass too haha "she can stick it in me anytime" hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S. Man, I wanted to put it in the review above, but suffice it to say the progression in this episode is too much I'm still recollecting myself, so if it sounds vague go watch it yourself you won't be disappointed<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It's a symbol of courtship you do over and over" Well it's also one of the things you do at a one night stand, so... Haha fidelity is an issue Miyabi</div></blockquote>"She is crying" "There are many moments like this in youth" Wow wtf mom?? Is this how you teach your kid? Lol in this new, final episode (12) of this wonderful wonder of a series (definite opening theme reference if you didn't notice), they kissed. It's about the <a href="https://jisho.org/word/%E7%94%9F%E9%85%A2" target="_blank">kiss</a>. (That was "kizu" btw) Yep, what a way to end the series, but yep, they gotta. So yeah, it starts with Miyabi asking if the two of them kissed, and it immediately went from wonder to like, depravity as Ao-chan somewhat desperately wants to do it with Kijima. Kissing, I mean. *laughs* And so yeah, they did. It's just who breaks the rules first, right? I mean, there are many things to break afterwards, but still. *laughs* Kijima is good at kissing because (lol) he practised it with a pillow (so... how do you do that? haha) and Ao-chan is good because... as Kijima said, is probably just because of the passion of doing it with the person she likes. Hey, it all sounds wrong, but only one thing is right: Ao-chan is in love. I mean, look at her exam results. *laughs* All in all, a lovely series that talks dirty the way Seitokai Yakuindomo does it, but give it a little more romance background so that someone here can get laid haha. So yeah, congrats Ao-chan for losing in life but gaining in relationships haha you're going to need both soon though so I don't know how you're not going to live up to the reputation of this series lol. Anyways, nice show to watch although it might be too short, but I laughed every episode (serious dad low pitch voice is the best imo) (second is everything that comes out of Waki Azumi's mouth) (including my semen haha what) and it was real entertaining to watch. Then again, Ao-chan really thinks too much, and has little to no experience in any of this (I guess reading books from the father wouldn't help much) (okay maybe it worked for Miyabi I don't know), which makes her the perfect girl to be in such a story. So yeah, congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/KAJI_staff/status/1142598267957587968" target="_blank">Kaji Yuki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Ayana_take/status/1142600080433696768" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana</a> on getting married to each other (yep sadded), since it probably started with something as awkward as this?

You pieces of sh*t how long did that take to happen?? *laughs* In this final episode (12) of this series we can break all rules and have the one girl talk now? Okay you are forgiven, Anime. Haha anyways, this is the most normal episode of all, I would say. Not like I remember much of what happened for the last 11 episodes, but it sure was a ride, and for everything lovely in a high school girls' life this might be the most appropriate ending. The theme this episode, is going home from school. Simple enough, and there's plenty for us to look at and wonder. Hey, if you're still enjoying your school days buying food from the convenience store, riding on bicycles and even sharing food with your friends, good on you. If not, we can but look. *laughs* Sounds sad, but you don't get to do this every time. Not unless you have friends. (BOOM got me) And that's what I think even the original work author is trying to depict, and that's actually quite lovely, in a sense. All in all, it was fun watching this series even though obviously, 3 minutes an episode is way too short. But then again, hearing the cries, laughs and even just the soothing music makes this show a wonder to behold. If this is what every Anime sounds like muted on dialogue, I'm glad this is the only show that can do it. Oh well they broke the rule by putting one at the end so whatever haha. As a final note, Tachibana Rika-sama, you're the best haha you may never go back to those days but still lol<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WhcbJ-tNQZ8/XQ81qCfrlDI/AAAAAAAAyDU/kipGWgvumSkYcOl2DMHIuIag4cp0ypxtQCLcBGAs/s320/joshikausei12_handbars.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qxmQO38Gqcw/XQ81r74YlzI/AAAAAAAAyDY/G6OQn9bBxwoTu9NskayKduCSUh2y7ykhACLcBGAs/s320/joshikausei12_cycling.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That is called "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/te" target="_blank">te</a> ga <a href="https://jisho.org/search/todoku" target="_blank">todoka</a>nai"</td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That is called "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/jitensha" target="_blank">jitensha</a> ni <a href="https://jisho.org/search/noru" target="_blank">nore</a>"</td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">(*Proudly brought to you by the "Klassic Note Japanese Lesson" series sponsored by <a href="http://jisho.org/">Jisho.org</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table>P.S.

Haha I may be thinking too much<br /><br /><div style="border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 4px 8px;">[Update 2019.06.24: If not for me missing another package I would probably be busy reviewing that now but no I have to finish this haha] <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Attack on Titan Season 3 Part.2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Anyone can be the god or the devil. All it takes is for people to believe it."</div></blockquote>"It was meant as a deterrence, and we will enjoy peace till the day we get found out and die" Oh dear King you dumb idiot haha. In this new episode (58) Eren thinks he can make noise and talk to himself without people around him thinking he knows the truth. What an idiot, this guy, through and through haha. Anyways, the story thus far. We know that the history is as weird as it can be, with Titans ruling the world and doing good and/or bad to some extent, until the humans decided to take control. Yeah that can be quite a problem, because these somewhat Nazist people are just killing the Eldian race away slowly but surely, which makes many have to retaliate, even if it means infiltrating the army and spying and killing their own people in order to keep up the illusion. Cue The Owl, probably an ancestor of Eren himself, who possess the Titan we now finally know the name of - The Attacking Titan. Hey, are we done now? This is the last episode? Haha moving on, he saved or more brutely, left Grisha the only survivor to when the resistance were discovered by the humans thanks to the son Zeke (what an- oh I shit on him last episode already?) so to task him with one last thing to do - find the Founding Titan. What is special about this Titan is, it's what that links the thoughts and memories of the other 9 Titans together. If Mikasa and Armin didn't blow your mind as Eren's ancestor blurted it out, you've got another thing coming. So yeah, Eren is in deep thought, through his dreams, considering the possibilities of activating the Founding Titan powers, if possible. What will happen to everyone around, the sub 200+ people who actually know the truth within the walls, we don't know. According to next episode, they may have to take a break, but seeing that from two seasons ago that it's a war against humans from the rest of the continent to say the least (Hange I may have to correct you there), so yeah, maybe we get to see the ocean before Eren dies in 7 years and Armin dies in 13? Oh man, these Eldians were just the victims of the one curse of the devil, isn't it? Poor thing, to be honest. On the other hand, I'm glad once again, the author has made great effort to make this storytelling convincing, and that it remains to be seen on what will really happen in the near future. . (Although one must wonder: if those humans took care of Titans back then in the war then aren't they better than the Scouts? Uh oh.)<br /><div class="popup"><span class="initial"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_4wizNdWtyk/XRDZgsD9CqI/AAAAAAAAyGQ/Fi4wV5x8hGwIj3SN06PRh7YuK2R4Y0loQCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan38_eren2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This position is so cliche...</td></tr></tbody></table></span><span class="pop" style="margin: 0; position: initial;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2fGhb7UX6Yk/XRDZhKv6ZnI/AAAAAAAAyGU/qI5p6sqcX-EGWHpQmiP-svVgoxbtD8bqgCLcBGAs/s320/attackontitan38_hange.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">...Hange-san gets MVP this episode haha</td></tr></tbody></table></span></div>P.S. "Have you no balls?" Man, got him with those ball jokes in the medieval times lol<br />P.P.S. Yes the panel was so that the Anime director can sit down with all the staff and cast to determine future seasons of this series lmao Kaji Yuki stop interrupting the meeting we know <a href="https://myanimelist.net/news/57844371" target="_blank">you're getting married to Ayachi</a> lol</div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>This week is a very quiet week in Klassic Note. Well, it was going to be a quiet week, so I took some effort to go back to listen to a couple of artists I've heard recently and try to give songs if possible. <b>amatsuuni's indie releases</b> aren't that interesting so I'm glad she got her major label debut haha, <b>Spira Spica</b> is more interesting than I thought so I might be giving another song we shall see, and <b>cinema staff's indie album</b> is... I guess it still sounds like them after all these years, but it's more rough. Pretty obvious considering I've heard a lot of indie rock bands. Not going to talk about <b>SPYAIR's new singles</b>, not going to talk about <b>sphere's new single</b> since it isn't available yet. I continued to give songs from <b>Yuuki Aoi's new album</b> (I had the mood now, and that is awesome) and <b>Middle Kids' new mini-album</b> if you heard of them yes they are English (Australian to be exact) and they are real great just avoid the religious stuff in the lyrics, yes?<br /><br />Next week? Still nothing. But I'll find something to listen. I know a couple of sites that'll lead me to new songs haha. On the news on Twitter, the only thing that probably caught my attention (besides the marriage between Kaji Yuki and Taketatsu Ayana which is technically not Klassic Note news) (it's just sad news to me personally lol) is the <b>downtime in SCANDAL's YouTube channel</b>. Don't ask me what happened because I... don't care. *laughs*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it I guess. As mentioned above, the next few weeks may be real lack of music so I shall go some exploring or take a break for now. I'm probably past my quota for the year so I could use a rest. On other things, I didn't have time to do it but I will have to rush through next week, but yes this blog is getting a revamp. Good news is, nothing will happen to you in any way as it'll look EXACTLY the same (not a joke) as you see it probably after the next Entertainment News post. I just need to do this so that I can reset the image gallery that is in each Blogger site because searching through the images is a pain. Maybe I'll do this on a yearly basis considering the amount of content I post every year, but that'll have to wait. For now, this blog will reach 5 years soon, I have a rough plan to make this work seamlessly, so when it happens maybe I'll update on it. And then maybe I'll update on the rest of the pages if I have the time. Maybe now's the time to use some of my paid leave huh, Nakano? *laughs* Cya later as I'll do another Manga Extra, if you would remember, since Tonari no Kashiwagi-san on probably my first purchase of a Japanese manga, without translations. Until then.<br /><script>var childDivs = document.getElementById('hashtags').getElementsByTagName('a'); for( i=0; i< childDivs.length; i++ ) {  var childDiv = childDivs[i];  childDiv.href = '/search?q=' + childDiv.text.substring(1); } </script><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
