I'll try this for a season and see how it works in here because Blogger is a- let's get to entertainment haha<br /><br />Life is better without real life women, my friends. Okay maybe it's because my real friend is trying to get laid and things got weird haha just like Anime!? Man, life imitates art lol<br />(*As this is not "The Statement" do not take this seriously)<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">Man, imagine a fox spirit comes into your life when your life is about to be in shambles... Why have I not seen one around yet? lol (ah you gotta be handsome lmao)</div></blockquote>I mean, if I see something totally wrong the moment I open my apartment door I wouldn't be that happy tbh haha. Anyways, in this first episode (1) of literally a show of fanservice, makes you wonder why Ao-chan gets 12mins and Joushikausei (we'll talk about that later) gets 3mins. Yeah. But then again this is probably a show that realises peoples' dreams like myself, so I'll take it. *laughs* This, is a slice-of-life show. And not your usual slice-of-life, of course, because it currently features only one man. Yes, a working man. Not schoolgirls, not kids. Well, if you consider that deity of a kid then maybe haha. Still, it's just a show where this guy suffers from the city's burdens of work (if you need a summary people in Japan work for at least 10 hours a day normally against their will) and never has enough time to take care of himself because he lives alone away from home. So yeah, with no one to help him around in his apartment (unlike in shows where you live with a manager who can take care of stuff for you) he just gets more and more depressed over time. He can't complain, because he's technically the breadwinner of the house I assume, so he suffers in silence. Not until the fox world hears about this and decide to help him out. Well, Senko-san decided to help him out. So yeah, she descended upon his house (literally, no need for locks and keys) and cooked him dinner after he has to work overtime again for the God-knows-how-many times this month. As like anyone else inside or outside Anime, pure shock should be your only reaciton until you realise this isn't a dream and you won't get caught by the cops for pedophilic activities lol. After he gets a satisfied dinner paid for <i>entirely</i> by the shrine lol, Senko explains herself to be someone who is in a mission to relief the guy (I don't remember his name haha) from his stress he has built up over time, so sure, pampering it is then, subtitles. It went from 0 to 100 real quick, as Senko takes on weirder requests besides cooking for the dude, was touching her tail. Okay, many things she has done for him has been nicely referenced to things from the old house in the countryside I assume, from the grandmother's tea to playing with the cat who probably won't squeal this much as Senko-san but hey, I'm not complaining about voices here. *laughs* All in all, quite an interesting episode to start with, and really reminds me of Anime "Kannagi" but this is a no joke one? So it really feels great to maybe consider watching this in the middle of my work week instead haha. Really, I can't find any reason to reject this show. Okay maybe the theme songs but when has it been an obstacle? Haha we shall see you next week Senko-san. Man, that tail on Waki Azumi going to make so many fanservice on live events hehe (just imagine it for a while everyone you'll get what I mean)<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I1ypThXuLY4/XLKsI-l--2I/AAAAAAAAv54/OGMqudA_e9Ef17xHazyrcA0Crx5K_SjTgCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan01_happiness.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Happiness is...</td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A9Z2aia2NUA/XLKsIhZWmSI/AAAAAAAAv50/fHB6xatiaV8Tpzu_IDSEpogPhDU9QLsRACLcBGAs/s320/senkosan01_tail.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Happiness is...</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

Another reason why I didn't regret watching this series from 2016, we're already at the third season, everyone. In this new episode (26) we go into another recollection arc because why not, we see how Port Mafia was formed. Well, today's Port Mafia. The group featuring Mori Ougai as the head. The one who assassinated the previous boss with a scalpel. The one Dazai saw him do. You know, if you can remember from I don't know what episode because it has been two years haha. Anyways, there are many to learn from this episode thus far, which will no doubt make a turn real quick as it goes on. But hey, I'll take a rollercoaster ride featuring Dazai and Chuuya. Hey, best Anime couple right there, ladies and gentlemen haha. Story goes there was a big explosion (I'm not going to pinpoint on this timeline because I'm not that invested in it you just need to know something happened after the event with Dazai's two friends) after the event which spawned the new Port Mafia, and it resulted in a crater in which a new city is born, right on an island off Yokohama. Problem is, recent sightings have been found of the previous leader being alive. Hey, he was killed though, slit in the throat. But apparently it's more than that. He came back to life for whatever reason, and was possessed by a god? (I'm not going to spell that name because I keep remembering it as Akihabara lmao) Hmm, in a world where ability users exist and immortals don't, this sounds really suspicious. We also get to see a young Dazai and Chuuya (I wouldn't say Mori Ougai is young, but still) who have to fight along with each other for the first time after it was formed combining an enemy's boss to someone who witnessed that old man's death. But this time, the mysterious power, instead of appearing on the previous boss, was on Hirotsu (I swear I had to wiki this because I forgot who he is and I only remember him from the one episode... yes Black Lizard haha) who came into fighting with Chuuya because the kid asked for it lmao. Through this, Mori Ougai offers him a deal. To share information and find out the truth so we can stop all this bullsh*t and you know, move on from the previous Port Mafia which is technically more brutal than the current one maybe. Man, I can't even imagine haha. And the current one has Chuuya and Akutagawa in it. Anyways, The kids start their first date together lol, and it's about to get more exciting. Hey, I'll take this show above everything. You know I like normal humans with crazy, extreme, larger than human possible powers that aren't DC and Marvel lol. God, this show is the best. Currently the only action show I'm liking because Attack on Titan is an obligation now haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CslSu91IPiI/XLK3WZCOqnI/AAAAAAAAv6Y/48nLi0QlvuIfI2pyVscuI9l-3lN0rBuawCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs26_chuuya1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The reminiscing action shots make this show all the more wonderful that it came back.</td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AVtyphbvMOg/XLK3Wgo9vcI/AAAAAAAAv6c/oWmL0Ch3U_UEzHMDdXy3xPt82nyi59R7ACLcBGAs/s320/straydogs26_dazai.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The reminiscing action shots make this show all the more wonderful that it came back?</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "Do you think there is any value in living?" Hey, Dazai, I ask myself the same question for the past decade haha<br />P.P.S. In case you need help understanding what happened, TL;DR some mysterious power possessed ex-Port Mafia leader (and Hirotsu without us knowing) definitely not due to vengeance but likely due to the explosion which created Suribachi City. How and why though? My guess is it's an ability user which created that (I mean, Chuuya can do that crater too technically) and is always nearby to possess user powers, and remember the two other enemy groups of the Port Mafia as mentioned by Hirotsu? Yeah, might be one of them. Also, we have no idea what the ex-boss' ability is so... He's alive at least haha<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"Let's have sex!" The dad approves haha new serialisation incoming lmao</div></blockquote>"To sum it up, it's enticingly sexy" Haha that's my friend when describing women lol must you be so detailed? Haha anyways, the only thing I've learnt again in this new episode (2) is that if there's anything to consult on don't talk with your dad haha. Okay it's just Ao-chan's dad but still. *laughs* Again, this show should be titled "Ao-chan Can't Do Romance" because just like Kijima she can't too. Don't ask me why, but then again it's everyone's first time anyways. Firstly, it's about Kijima's junk. *laughs* And that's how you start a comedy Anime haha. Anyways, Ao-chan seems interested by it for some reason (why) (haha must be the books the dad's influence is working...!!), and thinks of ways to find out how large it is for herself. I know it's easy for us guys to see each other's dong in the bathroom or public showers (you guys haven't done that? haha me neither) (Audience: LIAR!!) (haha) but hey, it's not possible for women to see in men, to say the least. Not unless you're in bed haha. And yes, they do say hands represent that thing's size, but you know it's not true (I swear I have a larger junk than my hands lmao), but then again when you only have your erotic dad as an encyclopedia (okay the dad was correct but that's extreme case, Ao-chan) and you can't really ask the guy directly... you know, but you gotta know. Haha maybe that's why then. But then it ended up being Kijima being serious talking about the confession he did in the first episode and asking Ao-chan to think seriously about it. Meaning the girl is talking about d*ck and the guy is talking about love. Hey, nice guy Kijima here I wonder what's up his sleeve haha. Next up, Ao-chan dressing up serious. Well, the friend was right btw haha. So yeah, fanservice for everyone including myself. Lastly, there's the book swap. It's about a vocabulary book only Ao-chan can read (really Kijima just bought it to look smart haha) and... the dad substituted it for one of his bondage books lol. So yeah, accidents happened and the two books got swapped, but Kijima didn't exactly read the book after that so Ao-chan was fine but not without the huge setup of misunderstandings at least. All in all, I have a feeling it's the first episode that may have left a bad impression on many but at the same time I still think it's a filter to chase away those who can't take the sex jokes and maybe the father going forward, but as of now I think it's still good, this series. And now I'm actually convinced that Ao-chan actually knows more stuff than me (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/sm" target="_blank">SM</a>, <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bdsm" target="_blank">BDSM</a>, <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yagai" target="_blank">outdoor</a> play etc.) (yes <a href="https://jisho.org/search/public%20sex" target="_blank">flashback to her introduction</a>) so allow me to enlighten you on sex in Japanese in the following weeks haha this show is great totally not Seitokai Yakuindomo in any way it's a <strike>shoujo Anime btw lmao</strike> okay confirmed it's shonen no wonder haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6XCKuaCOjw4/XLLRs_tk9qI/AAAAAAAAv68/BQO0r_i-8Us5ZLmGik-IavR-KWvj_e7fgCLcBGAs/s1600/aochan02_lethal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6XCKuaCOjw4/XLLRs_tk9qI/AAAAAAAAv68/BQO0r_i-8Us5ZLmGik-IavR-KWvj_e7fgCLcBGAs/s320/aochan02_lethal.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Wtf is this a Lethal Weapon reference?

Because it's a very quiet show? Okay, why I am watching this. Because of <a href="https://twitter.com/joshikau_anime/status/1114377439541694466" target="_blank">this</a>, Tachibana Rika. She's main girl, and I've been waiting to watch something I like and has her in it as main in an Anime, so here we are. But uh, just a heads up, this one is even shorter in length than Ao-chan (review above), so... yeah. Focus here is to create a story without dialogue while typically focused on slice-of-life things to... you know, ecchi stuff. *laughs* Let's talk about them. (I'll pile both episodes till now since I watched the first on a train and not formally earlier this week and did not write anything down) Firstly, in episode one (1) they gave us legs. Yeah, those long, white, flawless-without-a-speck Anime legs you guys asked for soooo much, they finally delivered. Not that showing legs is weird, but it's about what happened to it. It got mashed, it got exposed to a lot of classroom air, and got slapped. *laughs* Short enough to describe the content on 3 minutes? I believe so haha. Yep, and that's an episode already. Next up, the newest episode (2) gave us an unlucky day. Well, for main girl Momoko she is more than just feeling unlucky today. She tainted her shirt twice (yes, twice), pissed off crows while throwing out the trash, and can't even have lunch because all the packaging is opening in every other way but properly. You know, like if you open that milk pack by the side and it opens until halfway through the paper layer... we've definitely all been there. But for Momoko, she's just down on luck. Even the straw wasn't cooperating haha, let alone the vending machine. All in all, really weird series to watch in especially I can barely be satisfied about voice acting quality because there isn't much dialogue lol, but suffice it to say I like the simple stories, and sure, I'll watch this once a week. This is better for binge-watching for many after it ends airing on TV, so yeah, do what you want. Just give the cast a chance because I know all three of them. Okay not really Kubo Yurika but still<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kxX1rzVflBs/XLLYn71VeVI/AAAAAAAAv7c/H2rawF9K6wEeIDjZrAFjlg78mG1NahyjwCLcBGAs/s320/joshikausei02_packet.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is so relatable I can't even</td></tr></tbody></table></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZLVzVvpiPgo/XLLZwO1nUGI/AAAAAAAAv7k/qljPMy9aCJwHGATNJSS6AuZUDy0cpzXugCLcBGAs/s1600/joshikausei01_clapping.gif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sorry but I gotta make this one (with a higher frame rate lol)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

So in a nutshell, I gave two songs from <b>Cocoro Auction's new mini-album</b>, and another which is the topic song from <b>AIMI's new album</b>. This is as much as I can give, girl. I tried. Also, because of live performances again, <b>I gave another Fujifabric song</b> which was actually in the mini-album released earlier in the year, but I've only gotten to it now. Well, it's because of the mood, actually. And the quirky melody, but yeah, I gave it. This week, <b>Minase Inori's new album</b> probably hit more places than other on release date through the Internet including Twitter, YouTube and Apple Music Japan for me personally, and it was okay. I did give like, three songs off the bat including the topic song which I cannot forget for the week until I stopped listening to it, but yeah. *laughs* <b>Aimer's new albums</b> simply blew past me like a breeze as I barely got any interest from her new album songs, and I guess that's not good? I'll try to listen again next week. Kajiura Yuki-sensei is in it somehow so I want to give chance? As of now I'm giving songs written by not her though haha. I also caught up with <b>Touyama Nao's new album</b> which actually released last week (yep sorry Naobou) and... this might be worse. Hey, music labels? Why idol solo music career second albums always suck? *laughs* Okay it might just be with Inorin the last time but hey, I gotta reference something. I may just give one song, or none if Aimer is better compared to her. I know I shouldn't compare, but since I'm not exactly in the mood to listen to both albums, then I'd rather try to give good songs first. And I haven't decided on any. Oh well. I better try to give a couple before next week.<br /><br />Talking about next week, two much anticipated releases make me want to not work this week haha. Thank goodness for public holiday on Friday, yes? *cheers* <b>Uesaka Sumire's new single</b> might be the next potential single to be on my shelf considering I haven't heard the B-side yet? But the topic song is good though. The B-side is some insert song for OVA of Anime "POP TEAM EPIC", so... I hope it's good? I haven't heard any previews of it yet so may I not be surprised by it coming Wednesday haha. I say this first because no doubt I'll put forth&nbsp;<i>my</i>&nbsp;(because it's only me I swear) fullest attention (if it ever comes on time) on <b>Natsukawa Shiina's new album</b> which will probably be my most serious review ever this month haha. Okay, if it's good I'll try to give more. Her previous single B-side wasn't that memorable so I skipped it, but from previews I've heard the past couple of weeks it's hopeful, to say the least. Yay Nan-chan! And sorry Aki-chan but you've not been singing new songs. Must be the marriage thing haha (Not going to make the graveyard joke lol)<br /><br />On the Internet because Twitter ain't got enough news for me, <b>Niitsu Yui announced a new mini-album</b> since her album last year which will also feature the new music video which is on YouTube now, <strike>along with someone licensing <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM3tabf4MzQ" target="_blank">KANA-BOON's new music video</a></b> (I'll link it here) (and if you in Japan don't even try clicking on it)</strike> and <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923zOPHTWd4" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari revealing yet another new song</a></b> for a commercial. Nice song btw. You guys going to announce a new release at some point? I'm waiting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's it then. Recently I opened my website (this one) on like, IE9 (Internet Explorer 9 for those who never seen IE before) and man does it look like sh*t haha. So yeah, probably revamping the thumbnail designs to see if I can make it more backwards compatible, not like it matters because IE IS DEAD PEOPLE!! Haha even Edge browser is going Chromium. So yeah, upgrade your browsers, people. I personally recommend Vivaldi because I love Opera and it isn't what I know of anymore. Still, it's quite a customisable browser, so go take a look. Cya guys next time then, and until then... looks like Anime will be my fuel for the short...er week. Someone please give me courage to tell my superiors that I have nothing important to do at work haha bye<br /><script>var childDivs = document.getElementById('hashtags').getElementsByTagName('a'); for( i=0; i< childDivs.length; i++ ) {  var childDiv = childDivs[i];  childDiv.href = '/search?q=' + childDiv.text.substring(1); } </script><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
