<img id="news-thumbnail" style="display:none;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eGxF5p6B_oE/XLwmjdseMtI/AAAAAAAAwHE/Yjr9udXHXgsua6LpFcT47WCptfBe21keQCLcBGAs/s1600/senkosan02_cleaning.gif"/><div id="hashtags"><a>#senkosan</a> <a>#straydogs</a> <a>#aochan</a> <a>#joshikausei</a></div>Hey, everyone.<br /><br />And boy was that quite a weekend. It was a Good Friday, to be honest. Well, not until it turned real bad and I had to be hospitalised. Between you and me... you're not going to know it here just read the Statement before this post that's all you're getting haha<br /><br />Anyways, back in the helm, so let's get to all the shows we have to watch this week Jesus next week is going to be 2 hours worth of Anime already (excluding reviewing times) (and I pause my videos to comment) AND I have one left to reject which I somehow can't... How? Watch them all, I guess. This is going to be a good season of Anime haha let's start<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"But seriously Senko-san can we stop with the offerings for dinner?" lol just order online and tell the deliveryman to leave it by the doorstep</div></blockquote>"I feel like I'm swimming into criminal waters" Hey bro you're not wrong you're halfway there already wait till your neighbours find out haha. In this new episode (2) of non-stop fanservice or maid service depending on how you see it, you need to be reminded of one of the reasons Senko-san mentioned to help Nakano, and is that he is handsome. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> We'll get back to that in a moment haha, but at the start, more happiness. Well, until you notice you have to work again and you don't even want to wake up. (Ugh #IHateMondays) (good chances Monday just passed for him and he has the rest of the week lol) Senko-san obviously noticed that, so she kinda took it to a new level after giving him a night to remember lmao. Firstly, cleaning up the house and preparing everything else she missed, including the bed which we'll talk about later. It somewhat got the attention of the neighbour, but that I guess we won't get to see it now? Only her ears can be seen from afar let alone down the street so we're good for now. But hey, something's gonna call the cops when you consistently let a fox scream at your place haha. Still, another day of work getting shit on by your boss, and then... heaven. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> It is really like heaven and hell, this show. We just only get to see the former so that's great lol. Still, it took a lot of effort from the fox spirit, we have to remind Nakano to just online order groceries so he can stop eating cooked offerings lol, and Senko-san should stop tempting him by giving her own body to touch in return haha. (Reading the mind is a thing, but offering your celestial body...) (And I don't mean by a hot chick because she isn't lol) Okay, not directly, but then again, the thing that is worse than porn is the <u>insinuation of porn</u>. Trust me, I speak from experience haha. That ear caressing thing is this week's fanservice btw. And everything else... I guess you just need to remember she doesn't have like, a grown-up woman's body as a shell, so this would do I guess? I mean, I can bluff it over as my adopted child? Cosplaying as a fox 24/7?? Ugh, the misunderstandings keep piling up I can't even. Still, really an entertaining show about affection which probably none of us would have experienced (I don't have a bathtub at home, for starters), and he got a nice, warm bed to sleep in with it lol, and... we can only envy Nakano. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Hey, he put in the work and is seen by others, so I'll take that as compensation, this caretaking. Also, we were provided with a flashback of... Nakano's past life? I would like to believe so, but unless reincarnation allows you to retain your looks, I doubt it's the same person. Still, maybe that's why Senko-sen decided to help him with his busy life because he reminds it of someone. You know, probably an ancestor or something. I guess we won't know more because the neighbour will come into play real soon, and as an artist and probably also a stressed out person working from home (over deadlines), let's see if we can help her or get her some help. Man, I want to give the theme songs but even just the opening theme is not passing my standards UGH can we magically make the song good for my ears? Or maybe I also need to get my ears cleaned by Senko-san haha <a href="https://jisho.org/search/douzo" target="_blank">douzo</a> douzo haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iHkVjg7ZScs/XLwk5ybflgI/AAAAAAAAwGw/kRIX0JH2BBwE15FdPofDu64qFq1gl3ZfgCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan02_nakano1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me when I have to wake up at 7am every morning #TooReal</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vJXYu4uyUzY/XLwk59c2sVI/AAAAAAAAwGs/hYSGTVL-T_kx75flnHL6m1Ah1UWiFucDwCLcBGAs/s320/senkosan02_nakano2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Mw when I have to squeeze in the morning train<b>s</b> #TooReal</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

They can't afford the budget for this season? haha (also, must feel weird in the studio with their hands holding the scripts and the screen in front of them lmao)</div></blockquote>Well, there. We finally have an answer. You know, I like fast-paced shows like this. Remember when we had to watch like a whole season to know the truth? Well at least we don't have to in this new episode (27) since they didn't bother delaying the truth to next week, thank goodness. Firstly, the investigations. People were out there to kill Randou - the only person who probably had an eyewitness account of the explosion from eight years ago - to make sure Port Mafia becomes history. Chuuya took care of that, and Dazai went along with him to seek the truth. Problem is, he lied. Well, Randou didn't lie. He told the truth. He merely just gave himself away. He was also the only one who knew about the truth. To see Arahabaki in its true form. Why though? We'll be there in a second. Suffice it to say, and since Dazai took a bet with Chuuya (lol using an arcade game) on who can find out the truth first, both people have different intentions behind seeking the truth. (spoiler alert) Chuuya wanted to know the truth as he heard from the first person account from Randou, and since (spoiler alert on next phrase) Chuuya is Arahabaki (yep) he wants to silence the last of eyewitnesses so that he can continue with his current plan as the leader of The Sheep (even lying against the group of kids below him) to probably screw Port Mafia over by killing all of them. At this point it wouldn't make much sense to me personally as remember last episode? Hirotsu was technically possessed when he was fighting Chuuya himself, so this doesn't make any sense. But then again Chuuya wasn't seen after that so... And Dazai was witness to it too. We'll have to wait for next week to explain that part I guess, or just fight it out. On the other side, Dazai knew Randou had an eyewitness account, thought of who might have the Arahabaki power (he probably was safe in assuming it's the guy right beside him), and probably invited Randou to lunch (lol) so he can be easily found? Well, also to witness the truth which Randou seeks since if anything happens he can still technically protect himself in the open. (Okay it was indoors but still more open than his place which was burnt to a crisp) Also, and because (spoiler alert x2) Randou was the one who impersonated the ex-leader. (Did no one dig out that dork's grave to confirm? lol) (I mean, levitating out the coffin with gravitational power would also be easy lmao) Okay, not only because he had the same build lol, but more of because this was a good time to implicate someone on the incident to disrupt Port Mafia operations, as if he owns such great power. Hey, remember: this guy was more affiliated to the past Port Mafia than the group at this time, so incentive for betrayal is probably more than zero. All in all, if you're as surprised as me in knowing that Dazai knew all these the moment he heard Randou's account of the incidents, then you're average in intelligence haha. Which also explains the bet and inviting Randou out. Still, at this point it won't mean a lot to anyone besides Chuuya as we will have to see how Dazai is going to manage to save Randou maybe and not get himself exploded by the time bomb who is literally standing in front of him. Maybe that's where the bet came about, and he did win it by saying it first, according to the narrative. Ah, I see. Dazai is the supposed genius in this series, as usual. Getting out of the impending battle though, we'll have to watch next week to find out how. Wow, such hype haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0GsUiUKrInk/XLxkEv--MnI/AAAAAAAAwHQ/8jKs3xJqtqwg6UeKcNQUkEkNlTkRsp8jgCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs27_huh.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me this episode figuring out the mystery lmao</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1DogimGphjk/XLxkEtavMxI/AAAAAAAAwHU/y8gONaIUIxchnb2RCQkehoFs-juOH34YwCLcBGAs/s320/straydogs27_threatened.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I wish I could be this happy after being held a knife to me lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. So, with respect to what I deduced last week, I suspected that Arahabaki was a being that belongs to an ability user, and this user when dead can allow the spirit to not die with it, which makes it free to possess other beings like the ex-leader. In the second part I was clearly wrong, but the first I wasn't. It belonged to an ability user, and it is an ability user, but that the power was controllable unlike a free being which seeks destruction, even as Randou described. <strike>This probably also explains why Port Mafia has Chuuya under control because they already know it was him who did it. To create a city I doubt so, but to cause destruction more likely after the end of the Dark Ages.</strike>&nbsp;Okay I was wrong Dazai didn't know Chuuya was the explosion. Uh oh haha as expected this show is confusing to understand that's also what happens when you watch only halfway<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Midara na Ao-chan wa Benkyou ga Dekinai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It'll become a huge, lewd sex party (on the nights of school trips)" lol Ao-chan knows everything she literally thinks everyone at night fuc-</div></blockquote>"It's warm... and soft..." IT'S A WOMAN'S THIGH YOU IDIOT lol uh, I mean, he doesn't know. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Haha in this new episode (3) of whatever chastity belt Ao-chan has ordered but did not come on time, (or at all because the dad c*ckblocked it lmao) the class has to go for a school trip. And the father agrees to let her go to that over cram school? Well, because it involves cramming too but you won't get any smarter lmao. (Okay I promise the sex jokes stop here) (Forget I said that haha) Anyways, the guys went to the mountains for their school trip in which Ao-chan thinks is a place to get laid (lol), but then again more of them are just interested in what she thinks, and suggested hanging out together but Ao-chan... you know. I know there are Anime scenarios that do the stuff she thinks of, but this show isn't that. Well, it wasn't supposed to be it, I assume. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Firstly, Ao-chan tries to confront Kijima for the I don't know how many times, but instead hides herself in the closet. Besides getting a great grope from the guy lol, and probably making the rest of the class misunderstand what she said through her actions, the guys hang out by... going to the mountains for a game of fear-testing. Yeah, no sex party, Ao-chan. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And then, of course the two will go as a pair, and... many things happened. Haha namely Ao-chan thought she's going to get touched on in the toilet (likely by Kijima lol is what she would think) but it was a work glove, and... Ao-chan's skirt somehow got lifted so Kijima can see her panties. (But seriously, was that him peeing? What's with the waterfall sound effect did someone in production screw it up? lol) Unlikely her father's doing (thank goodness for that) because it seemed more like an accident, but hey, it took quite a while to explain that to Ao-chan before she faints upon knowing the truth. Well, any way this goes (direct or indirect) she also can't take it, so... good job on keeping this as clean as possible, Kijima. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, funny episode as usual, I already gave the opening theme song, so yeah, this one is in for sure. Also, I can't get enough of those moans lmao is that what the appeal is? Good work, guys, good work haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tOI96GRKm2U/XLxrf293ZsI/AAAAAAAAwHk/2DAVYuc2XwgQdY8--lCAwccwbVI2Oe4OACLcBGAs/s320/aochan03_kijima2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">When you noticed you have a bigger d*ck than your hands lol that was a last episode reference</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8mrtDpcZ91g/XLxrf6x_tWI/AAAAAAAAwHg/gNiwCjR02BEaUJzmQ1V_n_O4g_vQwv7zACLcBGAs/s320/aochan03_sex.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">These visualisations, man...</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

In this new episode (3) for the series so short I decided to exclude the quote above and probably the postscripts below from next week, this is a good summary of a great day compared to the bad day in the previous episode. Well, great for the one working guy, I guess. In short, the guy watched too much soccer overnight (yay go Team Japan!! haha #NotSoccerFan) and is tired to go to work, so he dozes off on the train standing. Don't worry; been there, done that. Thing is there's a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a> sitting in front of him. So yeah, he's happy. He decided to <strike>jerk off</strike> keep himself awake so to keep an impression in front of the girl? Sure, bro. How old are you again? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Anyways, he is barely doing so, so he decides to take out a... chewing gum (it took a while for me to remember this banned good in my country lol) and before he could eat it the train shook (normal stuff) and it landed in between the girl's thighs (not normal stuff lol). Hey, they don't call her <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futomomo" target="_blank">Momo</a>ko for nothing. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (Yes, also a reference to the first episode) She offered to give the now "tainted" gum back in the presence of everyone around him, so yeah, of course he refused. (Hey in reality though? Okay maybe not even if it tastes of sweet high school girl pu-) In return, Momoko kindly offered him a snack that was in her bag, so I guess they are even? He didn't get to taste his chewing gum though. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> What is this, "Ao-chan"?

I really expected a full-on EDM album even with the couple of previews I heard over the past month. Still, it wasn't too terrible, but I would safely say this album may have revealed to us how bad she can be at singing (oops) (hey in Klassic Note we have our standards haha), and how songs can be terrible to any extent in production. Remember Kotobuki Minako's first album was on my shelf? This one is not going to, I assure you. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><br />Next week, we welcome the only release I'll probably be focused on and will of course come on time, <b>NEGOTO's best album</b>, and their last. <span title="*sob*">üò¢</span> I know I did say on Twitter that I didn't give enough attention to them and give more songs over the years because they aren't the best, but that doesn't mean they didn't leave a good impression every time I give them songs. Still, this might be the last chance we'll be able to give anything, so I hope it won't end up like Kuso Iinkai earlier this year which I gave nothing. Yeah. Let's hope that won't happen. This album, and probably indie artists if I have time. Or Nan-chan, whichever comes first. Which do you think is more important now? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span><br /><br />On Twitter news, <b>nano.RIPE's new music video</b> is out for listening and it isn't bad because emo and I am vulnerable to those especially from them, <b>Kawano Marina's new music video</b> for her re-major debut single is out which got me a lot of attention because <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1118482123810205696">she retweeted it</a> (thanks!), <b>TrySail is releasing their first live performance videos on music streaming services</b> in parts every week starting this week (<a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1118513108236955648">I tweeted it</a> and almost forgot), and <b>Minase Inori is releasing a music video compilation</b> which no doubt fans will be snatching over pre-orders, I assume. Hey, I'm good with those Apple Music videos haha<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Just a short rant to end this post: Teichiku don't have good composers in them. And that is okay, as long as I'm not hearing songs that are sung by idols or by Anime characters, which is why for artists like the one who sang Anime "Joshikausei" theme song and Kawano Marina who just major debut over there won't be too affected because they write their own songs. And that, I will be less worried and more hopeful production doesn't destroy the songs for them. Refer to <a href="https://knwebreports2014.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-three-musketeers.html" target="_blank">my blog post</a> about song writing roles to learn more haha. Cya guys next week, and until then... hey we got another holiday to look forward too soon but too bad it isn't a Friday so... at least it's a good mid-week break haha maybe I should get a couple days off lol bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
