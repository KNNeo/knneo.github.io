<h2>The Entertainment News 2019 Edition Issue #12</h2>
Hey.<br /><br />Well, this week passed by quick. Which is kinda good I guess. Then again I did spend less nights after work this week alone, so... maybe it felt shorter? Oh well I don't want to type on this shit new keyboard for long so let's get to this lol<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"From my side I kept pushing in on her, and she kind of gave in to it" Sounds normal right there Natsuo HAHAHAHA&nbsp;</div></blockquote>Talk about real genius right here it's gotta be Rui-chan amirite, Natsuo? Natsuo? *laughs* On this whatever turnover of an episode (11) I have to turn my head over again? Okay, thank goodness this wasn't a porno lol. Let's talk about the things that ARE great haha. Firstly, the school trip. Hey, we gotta. So yeah, the guys had a wonderful time, we saw pretty much everyone in swimsuit especially the females (yep Hina-chan included), wasn't that much hype, but still. Everyone had a wonderful time in Okinawa, they played at the beach, had great time shopping, and saw the fireworks. It was a wonderful time. But you know who are having an even more wonderful time? No second guesses, haha. Anyways, let's talk about Rui. She got sad over what happened last episode obviously, and yeah, she knows Natsuo can only have one lover and it's not her (I don't want to cue any songs to describe her situaiton now tbh), so she decided to hate him for it. Well, Rui is right about why people do that to their exes lol. #RealityCheck right there, and of course she just settled things out with her sister who thinks it's her goddamn fault again for being the bi*ch (see the pattern now? I'm not even joking when I referred to Natsuo as the next guy to Shuu, but Hina-chan, man) and think she can revert things back to normal so they can- Okay Hina-chan, you try reverting the c** that flows through your w*** and then you tell me can revert back or not. *laughs* Serious things though, Natsuo got more serious in many things than other. I'm not going to re-emphasise how Miu-chan and the Kiriya-sensei were both right as Natsuo did not win the prize from submitting entries with the Literature Club but Rui won, is that he has the passion to do it. If he wants to be more than in name, then he has to work hard writing until you know, publishers can like your work haha. No really, that or you just post short stories online and get a fanbase. It's rather easy with social media if you don't write terribly haha. (I don't speak from experience btw I haven't done that yet) Also in his seriousness is to further his relationship with Hina, who now is still probably thinking on how to break up with him so she can get the family together- Okay Hina-chan the family is fine, okay?? Stop worrying about the sister and get together with the real man in the family, ok? (Sorry dad haha) All in all, quite a lot to think about as this episode reaches its climax (it probably did haha) and we're ending with a problem. Of course, it'll be sooner or later that this will happen as mentioned by Hina, but hey, how is this teacher going to stop people taking pictures of them kissing in the neighbourhood? To be honest? I'm glad it's not the bed scene photo because that'll be quite an issue to both of them haha may this series end well. I'm not going to say "with a bang" because I think I've got enough s*x for a series I just want some dramatic conclusion. To end this, if you haven't thought of doing <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Yoko_Hikasa" target="_blank">Yocchan</a> at any point... remember, she's married in real life. *laughs*<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AmkaT_UQZS0/XJcr4rtoFnI/AAAAAAAAvaA/5xM2aUT1fxgok7Jca-4YNN4AcZIVuP8TwCLcBGAs/s320/domekano11_bikini.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Again, I would be lying if my face isn't like Al's at the beach scene this episode hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uh3mAjQzWd4/XJcr4si1EBI/AAAAAAAAvZ8/8zmpbSqpGEskcaILY1TuVolD3JaWiijWQCLcBGAs/s320/domekano11_topless.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Again, I would be lying if my face isn't like Al's at the beach scene this episode hehe</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. It's going to be like "I'm going to start disliking you from now on" and then later she noticed she can't keep her hands off that man!! Hey, been there done that before, am I right, Hina-chan?? *laughs*<br />P.P.S. Miu-chan? I think I thought of something you can do in return at the school trip haha okay yah it's bikini okay??? She's got the figure I can see that lmao<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"If either would be open about their feelings, they'll be happy" Oh shit that hit Hayasaka real hard. Too bad she doesn't have someone to fall in love with? Poor thing, isn't it?</div></blockquote>That is THE SADDEST SIGH I've ever heard a female voice actress do one haha good job Koga Aoi you've broken my personal record lol. And yeah, Shirogane, I know it's your first love but still. *laughs* In this saddest episode (11) of this series ever, thank goodness we have Hayasaka as MVP, right??? HELL YEAH F**K YOU BEACH EPISODE *laughs* Okay, let's talk about everything that happened. Oh, another sentimental episode? I really like those though tbh. Firstly, Twitter. Besides the obvious change of logo in that social media platform within this Anime world (lol it even <a href="https://twitter.com/anime_kaguya/status/1109479883434934273" target="_blank">became the official Twitter account's icon</a>, no joke) we now know that Kaguya doesn't know of social media, and has apparently never left the browser homepage when using the PC to surf the internet. Really? Okay, we'll get to why later, but still. Hayasaka tries to teach her while taking over the staff used bathroom to take a bath alone (man, like a boss) (well she kind of is and I LOVE IT haha) but anyways, it still boiled down to Kaguya and her own ego for not clicking on that Follow button to send a request to see content on a protected account, to summarise. (If you don't understand go read an encyclopedia or something haha) You think it'll work if we teach Kaguya to impersonate someone else in a Twitter account? You know, to do the anonymous identity thing. It's not her ego by then, so she can be whatever she wants? No? It still won't work? Oh well. *laughs* Next up, Chika-chan misses Japan so much because of ramen. I know I shouldn't draw references to another Anime in title because "Koizumi-san who likes Ramen" is indeed an Anime which gets mocked on this joke real often (ie. "Fujiwara-san who likes Ramen"), so I'll just stop here haha. However, she has proven herself an expert in tasting ramen here, but then again maybe it's because she has been taught by her parents how to enjoy such a delicacy, and that itself might be impressive considering that even one of the four masters of Ramen tasting (lol debatable) bow down to her including the chef. Maybe I should really try that some time over here. What should I order again, Shoyu Ramen? Extra-thick noodles? Gotcha haha. Last but not least, a sentimental story that might be too real, but however will never happen in real life. Trust me, no one will do that. Not even me. *laughs* I'm also not going to reference lyrics from my decade of experience in J-Pop for this scene (see RSP's "Sakura"), but suffice it to say they want to meet. ("Sakura sakura aitai yo~haha" ) They want to meet so bad, they aren't connected on social media, and they technically have no official reason to message each other because ego issues lmao. Anyways, they thought they'll see each other in school in that very room but... the timing wasn't right. See? Just message on the phone and this wouldn't be an issue. You even came up with an excuse to leave the house too, Shirogane. (Kei-chan how did you just make the summer hotter than it should've been *icecream melts* haha) So yeah, there's that, I guess. I have a feeling I say that every episode but hey, it's kind of the reality of this series, to say the least. And that, I thank the author and/or production for making sure it hits us. Last but not least, the ending part. I know it's harsh to talk about the Shinomiya family, but considering she's the only and female child it spells problems to understanding Japanese family culture as a whole for discriminating female descendants. But I'll not touch on that, because as always, Hayasaka nailed that right in the coffin. That piece of sh*t of a father, really. Just go in a coffin. Hopefully by then your daughter will be truly happy. Maybe. Hey, we've got the fireworks festival coming up, and assuming the father ruined her shopping trip with the girls I just hope he doesn't step in on this one. We need a solid episode to end this really sad episode tbh imo I just... can't... please don't spoil it dad please I beg you<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8J-scZaw77Y/XJc5jJW0GMI/AAAAAAAAvaQ/awRz9q_a0bUMMdzHy9V0ScWooJeNoa5sACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama11_door.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Abuse of staff rights is totally acceptable as long as you're personal assistant to the owner's daughter lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iV6GKLcu6wk/XJc5jP-Ab-I/AAAAAAAAvaU/EiXXqTlBhtg18oYW4XA3OaV_PsvCQ6cMACLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama11_hayasaka2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I've never seen Hayasaka so content before.<br />I knew from here it'll be a good episode maybe haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. You may have screwed up half the summer holidays but you earned quite a lot of money, right? *looks at Shirogane* RIGHT??? No?<br />P.P.S. "She's as tech-savvy as the old man who runs the sweets shop" lmao Kaguya-sama don't worry I'm patient with people who can't IT just let me stay at your place as a servant haha (Oh and btw Koga Aoi if you also have problems with IT too just drop me a DM on Twitter HAHA)<br />[I am rather interested in the song Hayasaka was playing on her speaker(s) (twin speakers amirite? okay nvm) in the bath and... the credits did hint a title. I wonder if it's an oldie but I didn't find it online. Maybe it's going to be in the soundtrack? Oh please tell me it's going to have even a short version of it (Edit: It's likely a new song from <a href="https://twitter.com/kayoko225" target="_blank">Kusano Kayoko</a> who has very recently - just one month ago recently - announced her artist rename to her full name from her old alias "KAYOKO") (As confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/keikinishida/status/1109483885623009281" target="_blank">composer</a>'s tweet)]<br />[OMAKE!!!

I really didn't listen to anything much besides <b>Rie fu's new album</b> and... well it was folk music so I can't see to give anything off the bat just yet, but I did want to give a couple so we shall see. I also gave a listen to that one single from that game I'm still playing, and... <b>Yogee New Waves</b> did not appear. Oh well, next week perhaps? I'm so ready for them and they did not appear. Sadded.<br /><br />Next week bring us... nothing. Uh oh. (Okay, there's <b>SCANDAL new single</b> but I don't care lol) Well, maybe I should go find new artists to listen to again? Man, the leaving of many Collection Artists are really making some weeks in Klassic Note this year a bare desert tbh<br /><br />On Twitter, that <b>Yoru no Honki Dance appearance on a flood of circle live</b> was pretty great (thanks), <b>Minase Inori's new album</b> got a new promotional video teasing the topic song which I don't think will hold up just yet, and... <b>cinema staff confirmed their new single</b> for Anime "Attack on Titan" which will release in May. That last time is such a good piece of news, I was worried of their inactivity over the past year besides that collaboration single. AnimeJapan 2019 is also around this week, but in terms of songs I think I'll cover my ears along with Anime announcements so I can actually give a proper review in the near future.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Be sure to check out another photobook review I've done for my friend's birthday on our trip to the local bookstore (yep), and... I didn't plan for anything this weekend haha. Plenty of sleep is good for the week ahead, even though I haven't been doing that today lol. You know, DOAXVV problems, am I right? (Suffice it to say I only have time to run that free-to-play game in the weekend ie. grind to get all event rewards) Cya guys next week. I've been thinking of maintenance in Klassic Note and my PC <i>and</i> my deck of external hard disks, so you should at least be able to see the Klassic Note site changes rolling out gradually. Until next week, I guess.<br /><br />P.S. I'll try to do more posts in "The Everyday Life" like trying to convince my sister to get me a photobook for my birthday since she didn't get me anything yet. Wish me luck haha<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
