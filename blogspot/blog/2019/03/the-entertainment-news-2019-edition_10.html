<h2>The Entertainment News 2019 Edition Issue #10</h2>
Hey, guys. It has been a week.<br /><br />Well, you know it has been a week when you have to work overtime on Saturdays lmao okay let's talk about Anime and Japanese music everything else is boring anyways haha<br /><br />Really, people are still playing PUBG, gamers. Okay, PUBG mobile which is full of AI so not gaming standards anymore but still<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Domestic na Kanojo</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"It's not like I'm (moving) that far away" Yeah it's just next door? Haha Natsuo YOU WISH lol</div></blockquote>If there is ever an episode of Anime that make me want to f**k Hikasa Youko like, in person (mind you she's married in real life) this should be it. Really. Can we? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay serious things on this new episode (9) include a disappointed... well everybody haha that's us fans here waiting for something to happen you idiots lmao. You know it's a good episode when there's lots of kissing and I'm looking away from the monitor half the time haha ugh I need to grow up. Talking about growing up, Natsuo is technically dating with Hina-chan ie. his sensei and step elder sister? Sure, really expected that already with that kind of ending last episode, but yeah, they won't move on that fast apparently. Hey, Hina and Shuu's relationship did take like a couple of decades before it was torn apart lol. Then again, it's making Rui really confused, coming back to our topic on Hina leaving the house. Rui keeps thinking it's her fault but it's not (it's actually just that your sis just want some f**k time with the brother and it can't happen at home haha), and I guess along with Shuu's appearance which was totally a coincidence, sat down and listened to her talk about <strike>how they can't kiss because the sister's around</strike> haha okay not that. (Man, all these romance and sex jokes) She, like Natsuo, was feeling insecure for different reasons. For Rui, it's likely the blame she asserted on herself, along with unknown if it's romantic feelings towards Natsuo and that she can't express it since she did got found out. But I guess it's hard on her too, so this one she may have to compromise and give the sister some "freedom". We are not going to iterate what the freedom is though I've made enough sex jokes this one episode haha. Talking about those though, Hina did leave a note to only Natsuo which contained a key?? Yep, idiots, if you haven't watched enough romance shows before that's an open invitation for a guy to go to her place to f- okay not really, but yes Natsuo is right it's for him to make the decision. But hey again, if you remove the environment factor (ie. the family members under the same roof) then of course we can be together, right? Kinda, but that is until someone finds out then. You know, Japanese tradition problems or whatever lol. So yeah, they have to play the hiding game again. I mean, what's the difference between this and Hina-chan sandwiched between Shuu and his wife? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah this show is just ridiculously dramatic in every way possible. But I'll give plus points to the story: The imagination it led to though I cannot forgive haha I wrote so much cra-<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r9iv1lzj1i8/XISwx6hO-RI/AAAAAAAAuv4/sA0saHlHUDUP-IMseacJ0TQnf-3phQ74QCLcBGAs/s320/domekano09_al1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Me inside when I see a girl I like haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WctVgh9_wjo/XISwxxWvoGI/AAAAAAAAuv0/csMBwYVRxygsYmhP8ohMqlyCxbxU8L2pgCLcBGAs/s320/domekano09_hina5.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yeah, sensei isn't exactly a happy person, you know. It was Shuu, now Natsuo...</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. Then again personal opinion but, which do you think happened first: the affair or the road to divorce without it? If it's the latter then I don't see why Hina-chan can't get to love a man. Shuu did mention it was due to incompatibility issues. Oh well, Natsuo is better I guess haha I mean SHE GAVE HIM THE KEYS WTF haha suck it Shuu lol<br />P.P.S. "I came here prepared" and then Natsuo brings out a bag of condoms <span title="*laughs*">😆</span><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I wish you are normally this adorable" I KNOW RIGHT?? Thanks Koga Aoi, uh I mean, sick Kaguya haha</div></blockquote>LOL WTF KAGUYA SHOW SOME GENEROSITY AND JUST SEND HIM HOME ALREADY IF CANNOT IN SAME CAR THEN CALL IN TWO CARS haha you f**king idiot and we still say this is a show about geniuses? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay I'm sorry though, Kaguya. I sincerely am. In this new episode (9) we finally, FINALLY, can pack up and leave this series. They have done it. THEY, have done it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay waaaay too easy to call it so, but as Hasayaka has checked, it indeed was nothing much lol. And I like how this episode has a full on development of story, so we get to hear it from the start. Firstly, there's a typhoon. Besides Chika-chan obtaining first place in the cutest Anime characters in this season of shows yet again by being scared of thunder lol, Miyuki can't get home. Well in Japan, erratic weather happens the further you live away from the equator, and if it's bad it's <u>advised</u> (I've emphasised that so take notice) you do not go outdoors without any protection from the harsh weather outside. So yeah, some rack got herself a taxi (lmao) and Shirogane won't have the luxury to sit on it because Kaguya, as she wants him to sit on <i>her</i> car. Okay... nice try but ultimately I would assume Shirogane has no idea about that option, as in, availability of hitching a ride from Kaguya to his place. But hey, what's stopping Kaguya from doing it though? Because of her ego. We'll get to that in a bit on the second half, but suffice it to say it did not happen. As I expeced Miyuki chose to rush to his workplace and heck, being as strong of a man as he is from the countryside weathering this shouldn't be a problem. So yeah, compared to the frail, usually protected rich girl that is Kaguya who has been patiently waiting to actually do whatever she planned... I would say Kaguya that wasn't smart of you. You underestimated that country bumpkin haha. Someone please give her a smartphone so she can understand some social stuff too, please. Also, don't destroy other people's phones he got that second-hand too lmao. So yeah, which bring us to THE highlight of the episode: Kaguya falling sick. She caught a cold, but you must be wondering what is so crazy about her sick in bed she won't be moving around anyway... Or would she? But first, we gotta decide who to deliver the printouts (becuase it's still 2019 and they don't send you PDFs to print or have online portals for assignments lol) to her. Ishigami isn't that interested of course because he can't afford to die even with Kaguya sick haha, so it's technically a Concentration game between Chika-chan and the Prez in which SHE TOTALLY CHEATS YOU SHAMELESS GIRL!!! Haha just thought that I should join in on the Ishigami insult train lol. So yeah, works on her probably dumb af sisters, but not on that one genius, dear Chika-chan. Then again, Shirogane found out from Ishigami that he was at fault (yeah technically he is; it was almost a hit-and-run lol) so yeah by right he should go, to which he got nervous all of a sudden also after winning the game. Hey, you got us nervous too hehe. Lastly, the visit. Yep, he went to her place. Again, kudos to Hayasaka or whatever her new maid name is to disguise her name from the school lol, but if it wasn't her it'll look exactly like as if someone was delivering fast food to your doorstep. That was not it though, so thanks again, butler. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We also got to learn about how Kaguya behaves when she's in a cold fever, and as perfectly described by the <strike>maid</strike> <strike>butler</strike> maid, it's literally a fever dream for her as if she was drunk. (Ok for comparison now I want to see <strike>Koga</strike> Kaguya drunk haha she not legal age yet? Dammit) "Three hours man, how can I ever thank you enough??" <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We wished we were having fun though, not until the <strike>baby</strike> girl asks the boy to get into bed wtf this is not DomeKano right?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> As much as Kaguya is SHAMELESS HAHA *laughs like Kaguya* but man it's too real because Shirogane kinda needs some sleep from the part time work and hard work he puts in at school. So... all is well? Well, Shirogane probably had to go see the doctor for a bit which would've costed MORE money if he would've just let Chika-chan win, but the gains from this visit man... it's priceless. And of course, at least for Shirogane, it'll be memorable. No seriously, can we end the series now? I feel like I've watched two seasons of Anime to lead up to this scene already haha<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rDsUOEwYVcw/XIS-Tse0MAI/AAAAAAAAuwI/YbLPWX1cQyoDPxnSneqhAF6yS5e5bS7wgCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama09_naked1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">EXPECTATION<br />(Shirogane wtf are you thinking about)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRS4HbHGxj0/XIS-UOVIjjI/AAAAAAAAuwM/tDx-s4zp0rQrhoglPiiFhXpUQDOzIIsAwCLcBGAs/s320/kaguyasama09_sleep.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">REALITY??<br />(As much as this is AWESOME the eyes are creepy tbh)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "What is <a href="https://jisho.org/search/normally" target="_blank">normal</a> again?" I know right? lol Miyuki also <a href="https://jisho.org/search/futsuu" target="_blank">WORD PUN</a>&nbsp;(if you need help just DM me)<br />P.P.S. "It won't be a problem if he asks me to give him a ride home" Yeah right as if he knows if you have the capacity to fetch him to his home <span title="*silence*">😐</span> I mean, you can fetch him to your place haha<br />[I forgot to mention this above, but yeah turns out if it's still a surprise to you, Kaguya is that poor rich girl who was rich because of her family background but poor as she doesn't know of freedom. Freedom to do things like everyone else. So every time she tries to do it it is discouraged. I mean, how you gonna learn to love at this rate? Then again, now that Shirogane knows a lot more about this girl maybe he'll do some advances so that Kaguya won't feel restricted by her own behaviour again? Hey, there's a Part 2 for that particular scene (and it's in the manga I read to see how accurate it was) so I wonder if it'll ever <strike>be explained here</strike> be in a season 2 haha]<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on <strike>Klassic Note</strike> Apple Music</span></div></blockquote>Hey, it's a good week in Apple Music, so let's use that Twitter Moment to talk about it!

No one uses that feature that it's not in the mobile app)<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This Week on Apple Music: It has been half a year since I've heard FINLANDS, and I'm prepared for a new release.<br /><br />Experience everything from the rock music to that special vocalist style in the new EP.<a href="https://t.co/nkgfu1icOO">https://t.co/nkgfu1icOO</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1103311072042209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>FINLAND's new EP is kind of okay, and I already gave the topic song already, so here I'm just giving stuff that I like. The topic song, and the other song which sounded like them when they were emo. So yeah, getting into the vocals I am, but I would argue that I still can't take her slurs considering it's always so high-pitched and kinda random.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This Week on Apple Music: Takigawa Alisa is here to prove that Anime theme songs can be good.

Yeah, they kinda cemented it when they placed the B-side as one of the episode's insert songs, so... they win, I guess. On the other hand, long time no review, yes? Don't know why it always start at March though can't it start earlier? lol<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This Week on Apple Music: a flood of circle might be my new favourite for 2019, as I can't get enough of their Rock music.<br /><br />This album will make you a follower to them, I promise.<a href="https://t.co/8FherrfeLH">https://t.co/8FherrfeLH</a></div>— Kaineng (@KlassicNote) <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1103894368165945346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>Probably recommended release of the week besides the one on my shelf, a flood of circle's new album might be a good stepping stone towards placing them in higher position in Klassic Note, and I must say they are moving up.

It's another Anime theme song so why not, right? *looks at THE ORAL CIGARETTES* Anyways, I'm expecting more even from the B-side, but damn was it close to being on my shelf. Oh well, next time, guys.<br /><br />Maybe next time I'll do a Moments with cover art on it. But then I may have to steal from Apple Music so... maybe not? I'm trying to keep this clean tbh<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"><b>音楽</b></span> <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span></div></blockquote>Next week brings us... nothing. So... that's not good news. Erm... I might just go find some indie artists, I guess. It has been some time though, so my opinions for less than awesome music may be swayed. But then again there's Kiriku to Majou and I'm still listening to them today so... wish me luck next week? Well, if I have the time to listen, that is. I'll try.<br /><br />On Twitter news, uh... wait. Let's start with the freshest news of all!! Yoru no Honki Dance is releasing a new album coming June hell yeah, Uesama Sumire's new single is actually theme song to next season Anime in which... teachers date students so yeah DomeKano references there? (actually it feels more like Tsurezure Children but one of them in each couple is a teacher) Actually, that's pretty much it. Dull week on Twitter, I guess. Hey, but there's that Twitter Moment above, amirite?? <span title="*silence*">😐</span><br /><br />Well, dammit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm sorry if this is short. But yeah, that's what happens if you put a bunch of Tweets instead of a bunch of never-ending paragraphs lol. Okay, maybe we should do it this way next time. Or I should just do the hover thing which I swear I've not done it for the past at least three months haha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... I'm trying to make this place beautiful. Or responsive website. Or maybe the gallery is too hard to scroll down on to find stuff so I may want to move to a new place again. We shall see. We haven't reached our 5th anniversay yet in July. We shall see... Ok bye<hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
