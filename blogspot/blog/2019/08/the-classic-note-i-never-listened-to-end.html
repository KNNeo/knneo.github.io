<h2>The Classic Note I Never Listened To The End</h2>
Okay, welcome back. I decided this post should come first since I can't figure out the others quite yet so today's will be a short one.<br /><br />If you think this is related to Klassic Note, do not be surprised because it is. (Also, the title not a typo) This is just one of those posts I like to do to enlighten myself of such a time where I may not be able to hear songs in full and I can still like it and it's still on my list. How and why? I guess I should go back to the year 2011.<br /><br />(Note: It's not that I "never" listened to the end; it's just I didn't get to listen to it because it's cut off. Read on to find out more)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />THE BACKSTORY<br />Because back in 2011, I was still stuck in a time where digital download of music is barely there, music streaming isn't a thing, and most importantly, I'm still exploring artists in Japan, old and new. With regards to the "old" part... I watched an Anime titled "Bartender" in which the theme songs are written by disbanded group "Natural High", and yes, it's a bunch of wonderful ladies who have wrote and sang songs for like a good number of years but about a decade and a half ago. Yeah, that old. The Anime too. But despite of that, I still got interested in their music, so besides the Anime theme song release, I set out to find more of their releases to listen online and I found... nothing. Well, almost.<br /><br />THE SEARCH<br />So I covered as many (possibly) illegal sites as possible, searching for even just a preview of whatever potential this band has in like 2005 that I totally missed. Trust me, it was a tough search. Their band name too, it hits a lot of very normal phrases in English and is also the name of many brands and labels (adult video too) (and that's how actually...) (haha) So eventually I landed on sites which provided me a listen to the full song of two tracks, speficially from their "LIFE" single (same song title) and also from their "Prologue" single. So drum roll please...<br /><br />THE (INCOMPLETE) PREVIEW<br />"Prologue" was the song that was incomplete. I know I did say I had a listen to the FULL songs, but.... here's the big BUT here... it wasn't all complete. It did not play till the end. And it's not like the preview was broken or whatever, but supposedly it ended before like what, two notes till the end? It's really obvious if you listen to the original (preview) yourself. But I had already heard the song in full and loved it. So how? I came up with the most innovative solution ever, and with the power of audio editing... I faded the end away so it sounded complete. Whether the end of the song featured an abrupt pause or a smooth end with extra instrumentals, I will never know. But I would argue that it definitely sounded like the end and unlike many songs today, do not feature extra notes just to protect their own copyright or whatever because it's 2005. So yeah, this song has then been on my song list for as long as I've heard it.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-91PRSLLSNKg/XU6_M4zeRTI/AAAAAAAAzQA/T3O1ItWHMPEOR-cZ7saaFX58i0wwK8mOQCLcBGAs/s1600/640.v1536923316.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="640" data-original-width="640" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-91PRSLLSNKg/XU6_M4zeRTI/AAAAAAAAzQA/T3O1ItWHMPEOR-cZ7saaFX58i0wwK8mOQCLcBGAs/s200/640.v1536923316.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The double A-side single cover</td></tr></tbody></table><br />FOLLOW-UP?<br />I wondered to myself as I started with the idea for this post as to whether I will ever listen to this song in full, and the answer as of this post is... no. Maybe I will someday I continue to dream about keeping the ultimate music collection through legal music download (which technically is not considered mine because copyright laws) (no really, go read it up) but until then...&nbsp;I should go listen to it actually. *<a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1178458" target="_blank">listens to it on niconico</a>*<br /><br />Oh. That's it? Well technically this one is also kinda clipped as you can hear in the ending but still, nothing else in the end. And I think this is the same source I've gotten years ago so yeah, you can listen to it. I just happen to only have one that missed a good amount of seconds right after the clipped end.<br /><br />But someday, man. Someday I'll take that digital download and listen to it for myself. The time is not ripe yet, but when I do... I'll be sure to update this post and pat myself on the back that I have done something practically no one will do to pursue decade old Japanese music. Which will probably be the same as the (recorded) track I have now anyways so...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is it, I guess. It wasn't meant to be a mystery or anything, so don't think too much. Also, I chose to do this first instead of a long one like tomorrow and also on Monday (that one hopefully) because there's that new VR gear that has been around since 2 weeks ago. I broke the previous cheap one due to leaving on the shelf for too long (I sure hope the fate for this one won't be so) but yeah, Google Daydream headset, everyone. Coupled with my Google Pixel 2, I could explore the worlds in a less than stellar resolution but that's fine, since YouTube VR is probably the only thing I'll ever do since the games are expensive and I'll NEVER use this to watch pornography. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Haha cya guys tomorrow<hr><h4>#The Klassic Note</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
