That, and the fansub thing, man...<br /><br />Okay let's start I have to work tomorrow and it's not going to some army camp haha you didn't see that<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I'm not going to tease Nishikata... as much as I'm able to" Haha Takagi leaving yourself a backdoor I see</div></blockquote>Somehow Nishikata "locked" in the storage room with Takagi is making him scared and it's not because of the equipment BOOM GOT YOU haha don't do anything lewd, yes? *laughs* In this new episode (8) (god, the fansubs) we go even further into the reality that Takagi would like but Nishikata wouldn't. Haha isn't that every episode though ANYWAYS firstly it's the sports equipment whatever storage room. We've heard rumours about that place. How it's dusty, cold, even spooky, and that door man, it can never stop failing because it's been used so many times the school actually refused to maintain it AND it has to fail at that one time a girl and boy who somehow like each other are in it lmao. Anime reality check aside, Nishikata decided to pull (not the door but) a prank on Takagi for shitting on him almost kicking an own goal in soccer earlier in the lesson (hey I WISH some girl will come tell me that when I did it as a kid) (true story haha) and... it didn't turn out well. Also probably because he can be so easily seen by, for example, using the same trick back on someone who demonstrated the trick on you to freak you out... you know you are already dealing with someone way higher in IQ than you haha. Also, he kind of forgot that locking himself up with a girl in the storage room would spread (good) rumours about them, but not that it matters because I swear the whole class knows they are dating lol. And also, getting yourself injured in the process? Talk about poor planning because idiots don't plan- Next up, it's the Nurse's Room. Kind-hearted Takagi decided that it be better to treat that wound <strike>his boy</strike> Nishikata inflicted on himself, mind you, but it's more like a plan to just play with him... on words apparently (and if you need a lesson on how manipulative therapy "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/seitai" target="_blank">seitai</a>" contains pain "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/itai" target="_blank">itai</a>" links are provided haha) (then again it's a joke in itself, get it?) so yeah he lost once again. I mean, doesn't he get bored of losing? I guess it's like the USA national debt you can only lose more than you gain haha. And lastly, we talk about the lottery ticket. I mean, if as a kid you are dumb enough to skip all dagashi and burn your allowance (which is about 100 yen on average) on a lottery ticket just to see if you can win 500 yen then you are not treasuring your childhood enough haha. Also, you are a compulsive gambling addict visit the nearest agency for help lol. So yeah, focusing on the main couple, the two talk about what they would do if they win like say, a million yen (rough equivalent to USD 10k) from a ticket. (If Nishikata ever gets a million yen they'll get married HAHAHAHA come hit me Nishikata I dare you lol I'm another person who likes to tease him now) So yeah, Nishikata talks about comics and games as if his life depends on it, Takagi is slightly better by devoting some money to go out with <strike>him</strike> someone she likes on a vacation, and we know the most practical approach even as a kid their age is enterprise. Like, open your own lemonade shop or something. *sees The Sims flashbacks* Or investment, especially if your dad can do it better than you haha. Anyways, they had a fun time thinking about each other's "dreams" (Again, Takagi, your dreams are never going to come true-) while still literally letting Takagi throw as many research bombs she can at Nishikata so that the girl doesn't have to look at his dating profile and know she wants to be with him for the rest of his life haha. Oh, the series hasn't ended? *laughs* I know I may sound bored sometimes, but I genuinely (besides the teasing) want to see something happen to these two, no joke. And I know this is up to the Anime production so I won't say much, but make it good. Now that they somehow have more control over the storyline (like how they can talk about so many stuff and now exceed the one part) they should make this show something to remember. I mean, we did that a couple of years ago so I hope this season two can keep it up. By the way, only Nishikata is not keeping up the only thing he can keep up with is those push-ups lmao<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gUEa7QWL3Q0/XWtmYGDMTOI/AAAAAAAAz00/DCe_weUZl2Yk6H5YLj2aoJpoLmZWschSACLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_08_yukari.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Somehow watching Yukari-chan flustered is the best haha can we get that spin-off as an Anime series now?</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L3sj76sFkZQ/XWtmYuJIOLI/AAAAAAAAz04/RhiNUeIUo3YKbwajI7D2d9q2xrIWXpJlQCLcBGAs/s320/takagisanS2_08_eyecatch2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">She can step on me anytime- Oh this is not BDSM? lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S. "And I haven't eaten lunch yet!" wtf THAT is what you concerned about now? Why Nishikata you behave like Mina-chan lmao<br />P.P.S. "Have I ever (pulled a prank on you) before?" "It's all the time!" Haha this show in a nutshell<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background: #09a5b8; border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom;"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo.</span></div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: center;">"I have a boyfriend now." HELL YEAH *looks at Sugawara* Uh oh haha</div></blockquote>"Were French bulldogs always this cute?" Haha I hate you now Kazusa I'm so jealous of you AND Sonezaki now I can't even. Anyways, in this new episode (9) we know this is not going to last long enough for us to have it, but I'm going to enjoy it like how Kazusa is now hehe. (I know, and I haven't even been in one haha sadded) (Romance, I mean) As for Sonezaki? We need a change of club president haha Hongo-senpai please take over. *laughs* Maybe we should just disband lol. Anyways, let's talk about story; we have quite a cliffhanger to talk about this time around. (Don't we always? haha) Firstly, about Kazusa and Izumi. They are enjoying themselves kinda awkwardly. You know, ever since somehow the school had plenty more new couples because of the school festival. So yeah, they in it now. Not like much has changed for the two though, as Kazusa realised, just... more intimacy? Haha is that how romance works? I don't know. What I do know though is they are acting in their own accord without feeling for each other. I mean, holding hands on a couch alone together until they sweat as if like if anyone lets go they lose is probably not a good example of how to romance lol. I know it's a lot more than this, and all my experience comes from drama (yep I'm single, ladies) but I do know that a couple takes a lot more to feel for each other in order to make intimacy seem like second nature, and these two clearly haven't reached there. Well, considering they have been a decade of friends this might not come as easily as we think. Furthermore, we have Sugawara. After questioning from the romance-know-even-lesser Mo-chin it would seems like Sugawara is willing to give up friendship for romance probably thinking that Izumi might be the only guy she can get to be willing to do her, and... she might not be wrong. What is friendship anyway, amirite?? *silence* Ahem anyways, being evil does that to you (lol) so yeah that cute b*tch is not going to stop what she said at Episode 1, just a heads up. Also Mo-chin? I can't agree on you selling yourself (friendship, I mean) for someone else's romance, so... then again you don't get it so... *sigh* it's kinda hard to explain this to you too. Not that Sugawara has a better perspective on romance, but... yeah she's being a piece of shit here, we know. *laughs* So that will be interesting to see how this goes considering Sugawara will be using actions to prove her "love" for the guy compared to the childhood friend. Sonezaki is literally enjoying herself, praising all men (it's just the one guy lol) in romance until she forgets that heartbreak is also a thing, and... Mo-chin still somehow thinks she's stuck with understanding about love and probably being unable to help Kazusa in any way, and she is right: she can't. The Sugawara thing though... maybe just enlighten your tomo on it just so she can be prepared. For what though? I doubt she can handle it if it comes. (Not sex joke btw) Yeah I mean, just imagine the end of Episode 1 but instead of his right hand it's... MOVING ON!!! *laughs* Finally, we talk about probably the most mysterious and weirdest AV (adult video) spin-off we will be having here in this series hopefully not, that is Hongo-san and her novel writing. She found someone who can teach her the ways of writing, it is a man, so literally she found someone who can "esuibatsu"?? So how? I guess I did anticipate the next step forward, but man did it go by so quick and turn out so wrong. Milo-san here might just be going along with it lest this high school student thinks he's not into girls but also specifically into that one teacher in school (I mean, what's wrong with that? You jealous, girl? *laughs*), but more importantly I still believe even to the point where they are in the same car heading to like, a hotel, that the sensei will not sleep with her. Sleep? Yes. Do her? Highly unlikely. Partly because Hongo-san is high school student who is afraid of it anyways, and it's more likely even at this point that the sensei may still have a way to persuade her to not do such a thing in the first place. Again, many authors out there don't have to do it to understand such things. Though I would argue they probably had to read up on a lot of "reference material" to get half of reality anyways haha. To conclude, if it's between someone you liked all this while versus someone you know is hot and likes you like, just yesterday, I would not hesitate to take the former. Always. I may sound like a sick f**k, but just to tell anyone there who reads this, I'm ready to give up on ALL esuibatsu content IF I ever find someone who will like me. If anything otherwise happens take me to court with this blog post haha okay I'm done<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--GtvGpEuzDU/XWtyk_67mtI/AAAAAAAAz1I/H5-5nn7xKRoLd1Vm3vvGScUR1wli3HACgCLcBGAs/s320/araoto09_kazusa2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I'm putting these here since these two are pissing me off lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2LgAoTQTgV4/XWtyl3YB2II/AAAAAAAAz1M/msgB8UQdhmscbT0pGukyKj7Ppr1cHUe_QCLcBGAs/s320/araoto09_sonezaki2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I'm putting these here since these two are pissing me off lol</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

(when you present your boobs)" Oh God Lily you are sooo right haha</div></blockquote>I would like to take this opportunity to quote this from Anime "Asobi Asobase", but yeah, how big your boobs are in your genes, so... just go reincarnate, Loli. *laughs* ANOTHER LOLI EPISODE?? You can't make me do this I'm going to get caught by local authorities lmao in this new episode (9) we talk about fashion. I never thought I'll get hyped over this episode, but after watching the whole thing now... my life perspective has changed. *laughs* I would argue that this might be a better episode than last week where everyone just shows off their swimsuits which is technically a dream but... Okay, let's talk about this episode. *laughs* Firstly, Loli tries to get an image change. Because mainly, like many other girls out there, you don't learn fashion in a day. More importantly, you don't learn fashion from your parents. That... is the first terrible mistake you'll inevitably do when you are born so try to avoid that, yes? *laughs* (someone put up a laugh counter haha) Apart from that, if you really want to learn how to be fashionable, thanks to the Internet like <a href="https://nonno.hpplus.jp/" target="_blank">this site</a> (I just happen to know one because Baba Fumika is a model in it) you can learn those skills yourself, from cutting your own bangs (not recommended to do alone at home) to trimming eyebrows... there's always something new to learn along the years. Again, quoting the Anime above as mentioned, one should take the school days to start learning how to do these lest you get criticised by society for not knowing even how to dress yourself up, to be honest. So yeah, after getting bullied by kids (she's a high schooler btw) Loli set out to try to change her image as much as possible so to be adult-like for her petit body lol. So she starts with boobs. Well failing at that, Lily tries to help her by you know, getting a set of brassiere so she can stop wearing those kids ones, for a start. And so, bringing up her confidence, I like how she immediately goes to the brats who laugh at her chest (or lack thereof) only to be insulted again on other things- Oh. *laughs* Then, she goes for makeup. Yeah, she doesn't have proper makeup at home considering what her grandmother would be using (don't even Google that you won't believe what people use half a century ago) and pencils will look real ugly in real life, so... don't laugh at her, yes? *laughs* (The animation is really trying to make sure the quality doesn't drop because of this though) As nice as Lily is again as she is holding back her laugh, she kindly helped her out by teaching her the ways of putting powder and ink properly on your face. Lastly, Majime and Loli play dress-up. Since Loli's place is full of clothing that her parents sent her ie. zero fashion budget required (lucky you, many <strike>kids</strike> girls want to be like you too haha) so it's super easy to make her even cuter than she is now lol. I mean, look at Lily salivating lmao. Then, part 2: we go to Majime's place. Besides the lookalike mother which made me think Lily is actually more into girls than she is not into guys because of her rash (lol), Majime has nothing to show on her wardrobe. Real pathetic but also, real sad. I doubt we will see a revival episode for Majime since we are all dying looking at outfits from Loli (hey you lolicon haha me too actually) at least we get to see a hairstyle play for her, I guess. And as for Lily... Seitokai Yakuindomo has been doing your voice well since then, Satomi-chan. *laughs* Last but not least, we HAVE to talk about the Kujou sisters and the younger sister's friends visiting the elder sister haha. Yeah, we've got competition now. *laughs* But heck, the imouto is the best Majou don't ever let her give up on you she will save your life by making you friends through fortune-telling you don't even know<br /><div class="thumbnail"><div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LkqyR-PP9b8/XWuBSLPLRDI/AAAAAAAAz14/FYogZ-P5dYIdauMVswvCzFH-SsB5qwgowCLcBGAs/s320/jyoshimuda09_lily1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">That's your 4th-dimension glance right there haha</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="615" data-original-width="1600" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOz-YqJsDYA/XWuCF0cj_xI/AAAAAAAAz2I/RlfzjrdDtwAArYk9q7UqyS2dvn4LnosXACLcBGAs/s640/jyoshimuda09_eating.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="468" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's not that last supper masterpiece but close enough haha<br />(If I ever get to date Wota the last thing I want to do with her is eat. *laughs*)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>P.S.

I'm skipping GENNARI's latest single and giving the one song from Ayahi-chan, <b>THE ORAL CIGARETTES best album</b> ALMOST got them into the Collection because they didn't since I missed giving one song which I might still give over next week we shall see, and... <b>Fuchigami Mai's new single</b>... I'm just glad the full music video of the topic song is online, okay? Idolism is very important in this era, you know. *laughs* But seriously, best summer song this year or more like only summer song haha<br /><br />Okay looks like next week is the real peak... it's pretty much the same as last week? Damn lol. <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> for Anime "Araoto" will be out next week hopefully it doesn't suck so we can do out quaterly review as expected lmao, and <b>MaRuRi to Ryuga's new mini-album</b> is probably going to hit headlines this week I promise.<br /><br />On news over the Internet, Anisama (ie. Animelo Summer Live, the largest yearly Anime song live event in Japan) dominated the weekend with me only being able to see the tracklist (well you can buy the recorded version like... 6 months from now lol) so I won't talk too much about it since I didn't get to see anything yet but the <a href="https://twitter.com/anisama/status/1168138173525835778" target="_blank"><b>K-ON! reunion live</b></a> should be a surprise to many. <b>Natsukawa Shiina's 1st EP</b> reveals a rather different style along with that topic song music video which... she trying to compete against Amamiya Sora on who is sexier? *laughs* No wonder <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2019/09/the-dream-fragment-20190901-and-someone.html" >she had that dream</a>. That is it, really. You know I'm padding this paragraph for content, right? Haha well I was just speaking out my mind though<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This should be it. Cya guys next week and until then I have to stop playing Zelda and go sleep early. *sigh* #WorkProblems amirite? <strike>Oh well, fun's over where you can sleep all day</strike> Until next time... take care of yourselves, man. It's "summer" right here and it's real hot. I mean, I am going to work in an aircon room tomorrow so it doesn't matter but... drink more water, yes? I'm... trying to be nice so girls will like me haha bye<br /><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
