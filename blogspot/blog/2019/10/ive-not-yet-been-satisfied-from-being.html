<b>I've not yet been satisfied from being recognised for my interests for me to think of others on what they are interested in.</b><div><br></div><div>Sorry if this sounds selfish, but maybe I think too much or I'll never get social people, but it seems like so. Social people tend to be who they are because they may have been satisfied over being recognised on their interests, say music tastes, that they can have capacity to like what others like. It's slightly different from what I thought as a kid that you might not be exposed yet so you're curious, but it might be a thirst for further exploration. What happens when you get what you want lol</div><hr><h4>#The Statement</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
