Or is it this season's   offerings rather bad of a choice to begin with?? Haha okay "KoiKimo" was   actually good I will recommend this to people who like romance shows tbh </div><div><br /></div><div>  My week? Oh this is the best I had in months! Just ask the two posts I did   earlier this week. *laughs* Jokes aside, I hardly get this long of a break   thanks to public holiday ie. 3-day work week, and I technically have a 2-day   work week coming up after next week so... I guess I can survive next week lmao   I mean it's not that hard just that due to new restrictions we can't go out   for lunch now lol we can still go to office though so... Why? Haha</div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, Anime shall we? Also music because I gotta postscript some things   that can't be left on its own post or I'm just lazy to do them lol okay it's   always me huh<br />  <div><br /></div>  <div>    <br />    <br /><br />    <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo07">  <div style="text-align: center;"> <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>  </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Should I leave? But that First Press Limited Edition cover..." That's     me if I live in Japan FYI haha   </div>    </blockquote>    "I like it too... this series" Damn Tamaru you almost got beheaded by your love rival haha what. *laughs* In this cringe episode but looks like it's like this every week now lol (#KoiKimo07) no one had evil intentions but Ryou this motherf**ker... Haha okay nvm Tamaru asked for it anyways lol. So firstly, otaku talk I guess though I swear this is not <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35968/Wotaku_ni_Koi_wa_Muzukashii" target="_blank">that other otaku romance Anime</a>. You see, the problem about all this is that Ryou's in it. If he isn't even in this circle things would have been easier for Tamaru and Matsushima lmao. Okay Ichika-chan too to be honest so goddamn he's soooo in the way. *laughs* So yeah, in the many scenes of bookstores that isn't <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san" target="_blank">the one in the electronics store district</a>    lol, we see almost all the characters buying the new volume of the most popular series in the Anime world itself haha like really Masuda and Rio are the only ones not buying it lol. Tamaru is trying to avoid Ryou like he's a mine but he really is especially when you know that freak, and Matsushima is rewarding herself after a good month's work. I feel you girl; This says a lot about my blog posts for this week haha *dabs* Also, she met this young cute <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a> who also is into the same series and the same character just by watching the Anime trailer haha. Trust me, it's very <a href="https://jisho.org/search/guuzen" target="_blank">guuzen</a> over in this small world lol everyone likes the same thing too. Yes, as in Ichika-chan haha. But not that, and the girls then talked to each other haha you know this is part of my life goals right? Making friends like that lol. *sob* And I think they just became <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%83%9E%E3%83%96" target="_blank">mabu</a>    after just 5 minutes honestly THIS is the stuff I want to experience buying stuff from bookstores in Japan. *sigh* Haha I guess not then. Or maybe I can, just... stop liking obscure things haha I don't aim to do that I only like niche stuff like "Douki-chan" lol I don't think they sell locally. *laughs* Everyone read the book on the day it's released even without pre-order (surprisingly they are really well stocked lol?) and I would rather think that Matsushima should be thinking about how Ryou would like someone who likes the same stuff as her but NOT her (oops haha), but you know, they just did the "not a coincidence" thing instead. Oh well. *laughs* (Matsushima tweets a lot too so that's cool...?) (Oh I should be doing that too I guess lol I don't know how to social media, please) I see we have more family problems coming up in the Amakusa family with the mother and possibly the father's return home but we will not poke into that just yet since it's that against Tamaru in case you didn't notice, we'll talk about what's coming up next: Valentine's Day. Okay, it's three months too late even if the actual thing is next episode, but suffice it to say and that's what everyone around Ichika is saying anyways: I think Ryou will take any chocolate even if it's bought from the store. Just, <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lu4BygPQVTQ/YKCI7nHB-tI/AAAAAAABElo/VtZNg4TOi9ca5_9rSMC69yEPPtpXGXmRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/ackc02_22.jpg" target="_blank">don't make those ones with frog meat in it</a>&nbsp;("<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi_TV" target="_blank">Acchi Kocchi</a>" btw that is "worst best friend" Mayoi-chan haha) lol though if you give Ryou weird stuff he might enjoy it too? *laughs* Anyways, <strike>she felt like</strike> she was pressured to give him something as with all things like Christmas, but you know our dear Ichika-chan is too nice and if I compliment her Ryou will kill me so I'll keep my distance lol, but you know, it's about what to give, right? Rio is not giving her any hints and I doubt she can in this case, Masuda was around school (stop being a stalker dude) and he saw Ichika so he took her to lunch (Ryou: WHAT) but also gave her a hint as to why it's better not to give him chocolate. I wonder if it's that or for most women he was dating or hanging out with they just give him... action like what Ichika almost thought of doing lmao oooh boy Ryou what have you turned this girl into. *laughs* And I'm pretty sure if you send him <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-srsmB2xynd8/YKCKup1hPMI/AAAAAAABElw/k9kE4RcbdagxCDoKLCYlRGvSqOFlfiavACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/screen-shot-2020-08-08-at-14.28.31-1.jpg" target="_blank">chocolate mint</a>    he'll wring your neck haha how about send him "I'm dating someone" message? HAHAHA cya guys next week lol oh wait MATSUSHIMA TOO!!??? OH NO haha why ending why the drop lol NEXT WEEK HYPE hehe I wanna know what happens   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UpWhAFMHOqc/YKEBirdzutI/AAAAAAABEmk/wd6Yd947WAIBx1hen7pkFVTCZSaNB7cJACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo07_aaaaaa.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    I love Ichika questioning her (romance) life choices lol    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AbyVOwG_ncs/YKEBlkVCfKI/AAAAAAABEmo/SNhipaDuXBQxlmnYszo5yyzY9TfBn0g9ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo07_matsushima1.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Find someone who will hug you like how Matsushima hugs the     newest volume of Forward World haha    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>    </div>    P.S.

Just living the     life out there huh (lol) (ugh)</div>    </blockquote>    OH NO so he is one of those guys who got his stick into her hole. *laughs* Hey, I'm trying to be clean here don't rat me out haha. In this new episode (#HigeHiro06) we are SO CLOSE into ending this part about Sayu's life residing with Yoshida already and this guy came in (sex joke haha) ARGH ANIME WHY *laughs* (Okay I think I better say it first: She's gonna get violated somehow before this episode ends) (Edit: What did I tell you haha) So, story first I guess. I'll... try to make this less rated than the stuff above so... Okay. *laughs* Story goes that Yaguchi is our new guy here, well not new guy because coincidentally, and that's why we shouldn't have allowed Sayu to work just because, this dude is one of the filthy bastards she slept with lol okay me. I'm keeping personal criticisms to a minimum, I promise. *laughs* Anyways, obviously there has to be a stand-off where this guy totally wants to try his crotch on her again so yeah, blah blah blah threaten to tell her past to everyone unless he goes to her place where she lives now and does it in front of the other dude so yeah guess what Sayu that won't get your dad Yoshida worried lmao. So why do you think Yoshida is here protecting you like he's your father?? Because you're a f**king idiot!! (I promise this will be the last time I rant about this but) Even the millions of females out there know about female rights and you just let things happen!! What is wrong with you, b*tch!?? Okay I'm good moving on. *laughs* I guess this is what the author wants to do but in a smaller time frame maybe, because all one could do is just leave. Also, probably a consequence of letting her go out to work, huh. She's bound to meet someone who will remind her of her past, just saying. (Then again, I wonder if ignoring and feigning innocence is better or not) (Hey I'm not the author you tell me) So yeah, Sayu let the wolf into her den (that sounds wrong haha), they weren't there "just to talk" surprise surprise, but Yoshida obviously knows this is weird and came in to the rescue, thank goodness. And because I am pissed off on how Yoshida didn't beat this guy into a pulp or spit shit at him for being one of those guys that did something to her, I would argue that since Yaguchi is technically doing illegal things like what Yoshida is doing now just different things but still illegal (lol), they let each other off the hook a bit which I guess it is scripted because I swear in real life it's the revenge thing where the cops would've known about what happened by now so (Or maybe I watched too much drama haha...) So, next day Asami confronts Yaguchi about what happened the evening before, and interestingly, the guy apologizes. Well, not that it's a bad thing since somehow everyone's turning nice and he can't do much I guess because I SWEAR he will do something as long as we put one more guy who behaves the same way as he does haha yeah that'll be the time where I stop watching this series tbh. So yeah, count yourself lucky Sayu-chan; people around you who you barely knew are saving you once again. Then, the story with Asami. Yoshida is worried about her ever since what dumb shit she did to herself recently (lol like I would be worried too tbh), so Asami being her buddy at work now decides to stay over at her place to protect her, I guess. They stopped by her place ("Wow Asami that's a big house you live in. You sleeping with guys too?" lmao) (Well technically not wrong it's her dad) and yeah, girls' talk time I guess, if that is not obvious to you. I mean, what else you gonna do for the rest of the night? No one bought a strap-on so... *laughs* Okay jokes aside, we hear a little more about Asami's story after Sayu talked about hers which we have heard a thousand times and it's still missing the "why she left Hokkaido" part lol. Asami has very respectable people in society as parents means they have no time for her, she dressed up in this fashion so to blow her parents' minds, her mother was insisting on her career prospects ("You want to be an author? That's&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/chou" target="_blank">super</a>    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ukeru" target="_blank">funny</a>" lol) though I would argue she can do it in secret tbh considering her situation and her amount of free time, but you know, her dad has different opinions, which landed her where she is today. So looks like everyone has an interesting past here, so yeah, reinforcing the circumstances so far though, not much to think about. Just that Sayu-chan has to think about her past and future a lot more now that she doesn't have to <strike>have sex</strike> jump between other mens' houses for a living. All in all, I just keep pondering every episode about Sayu's future, or more specifically, what is going to be the conclusion for this Anime series. Because if you think about it, even in the most extreme of situations ie. this episode, we just end up with a simple conclusion maybe because Yaguchi also is a criminal himself but we're all just trying to save this poor girl who has a great body to f- You get the idea. *laughs* Hmm, guess we'll watch to find out next week.   </div>  <div>    [Just like any porn actress, Sayu-chan has to use a temporary profile in order to sleep with men to prevent revealing her actual name- Do you know in most if not all videos most actresses are under an alias? Which also means alternatively if you are interested in any of them the fan community can help you identify their names including me lol]   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_7MYnD90VWM/YKEEN4CjA-I/AAAAAAABEnE/uFd1hNdvJ38uraG7eqzgTBhRWG_5XfmDQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro06_girls2.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    I didn't screenshot much this episode so here's some wholesome     content<br />(Anime camera angles with the deep chins lol)    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cOIy1iN0_hQ/YKEENzBUFQI/AAAAAAABEnA/YBDSecmqdbwT0esWxEAHSGnjrPSPR_CSwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro06_girls3.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    I didn't screenshot much this episode so here's some wholesome     content<br />(No they are not under a lamppost stars can't light     up a ground this bright)    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>    </div>    P.S. "If you don't want to tell someone about it, you don't have to tell them" Uh that's not true we just got through consultation for like, 5 episodes lol (We shall see, Asami, we shall see)   </div>  <div>    P.P.S. "We both know each other really well, right?" Yes, bodies, yes, the subtitles were really kind this episode haha<br />    <br />    <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="OsaMake05">  <div style="text-align: center;"> <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">  Osananajimi ga Zettai ni Makenai Love Comedy</span>  </div>    </blockquote>    <blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "If we start buttoning right in the first place, there wouldn't be any     problems" Ah, about that... *laughs*   </div>    </blockquote>    Oh yeah, this bullsh*t. *laughs* In this new episode where I don't know I should even be laughing at this level of lameness or not (#OsaMake05) oh we still have to deal with Maria-chan at Sueharu's place, huh. *laughs* Man, this series haha. You got a feeling where you're aroused but you don't want to jerk off? That's what I'm feeling about this series in general lol wait, what? I don't mean sexually, please. *laughs* Anyways, story. And if me talking about what looks like the entertainment industry is already scaring you because you don't want to see this in an Anime, so sorry, I'm afraid being like me and being here just because you dodged all those is not going to help here. *laughs* So, the amnesia. We don't know if it's real or not even after this episode, so I'll say it with a pinch of salt here. With her sister Midori's description of what is happening to her at home, it doesn't look right. And she did mention herself she only remembered as much as before the Confession Festival it seems, and I won't say that is a good thing but you can figure it out. Along with whatever Maria-chan proposed to Sueharu about coming back into acting, you can see how much Sueharu has to deal with for now. But you know, Shirokusa can still step in to "protect" him for now. Maybe. And as the trio sit in the limo probably going to school but through the back gate just because... Oh yeah almost slipped my mind but Kuroha could be acting for all we know. She got her sisters as backup too so that's not hard. Remember: This is a love comedy about revenge. Who said the revenge has ended? *laughs* Call me Detective Shouhei please thanks drop by my Agency if you need help lol. Anyways, we'll just take it at face value just like how I take all their faces at face value lol. So mainly this episode is just Sueharu deciding on his next step of action after that video went bonkers and long after he left the entertainment industry with reasons we should know by now. Yeah Sueharu has gone though a lot of pain in the entertainment industry. Just look back at the screenshots from the past few weeks lol. ("Pain" as in interactions with females lmao) Everyone sat down in a meeting with Tetsuhiko like anyone would in this situation lol why, and the friend proposed doing everything like as if it's in the entertainment industry, but in school, so that Sueharu can still live his school life and not be bogged down by money. We'll get to that later, but looks like this dude is taking the whole gang with him to see that CEO of a talent company I guess, Kuroha and Tetsuhiko and Shirokusa and everything lol okay sure. *laughs* And I think the final part helps nail this in the coffin, because as much as I don't enjoy watching this series going on with whatever not romance comedy this was supposed to be (please, it's even in the title), the acting CEO which his mother knows of Sueharu as a kid, is quite a piece of cr*p. As capitalist as he is, he is baiting the two prospective talents with a lot of money just so he can probably achieve his objectives, one of them probably capitalizing on whatever fifth wave is happening right now. So yeah, that's going to be something to watch, seeing as this part of the proposal probably failed with that bottle of wine dunked on that dude's head. All in all, man... I think you get the idea. And maybe it's because I watched shows every week from lovely to mildly irritating to this that is aggravating me in some way, but I legit do not enjoy the background topic of discussion this Anime is in. Looks like being in here just for the romance comedy part might not be a good idea after all. I will see this through though; I still can see how this will go and seeing the external forces already flowing throughout this world. I think I have a good idea on how this will go. Again, I wish it was just a harem. Looks like I got a lot more than I asked for tbh haha cya guys next week for more weird storytelling lol   </div>  <div>    <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UOGIhjDBgTY/YKEGNGvi4OI/AAAAAAABEnU/K7DNQmb-TQcRhHoBAzTB4YCmKmWPV1_PgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/osamake05_slapping.gif" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    What I was here for<br />(Oh yeah  <strike><a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187165/Kuroha_Shida" target="_blank">Inorin</a></strike>    Kuroha that feels great don't stop slapping me lol)    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xj7C5dH1cwo/YKEGEmsg4xI/AAAAAAABEnQ/Zg7-549iRN4wKFHLWaRvlCNQOnmXp2oTgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake05_fear3.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    What I wasn't here for<br />(WTF I didn't know Maria-chan here     is a dominatrix)<br />(Oh man if&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187167/Maria_Momosaka" target="_blank">Oonishi Saori</a>    is one though... haha)    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>    </div>    P.S.

I   didn't give   <a href="https://twitter.com/gotch_akg/status/1392141038848942081?s=20" target="_blank">the song Gotch recommended</a>  in the album though so... *laughs* They are kinda chill like Yogee New   Waves but maybe worse(?) and with a female singer so I'm not that keen but   the former isn't writing new songs so far so I'll take these guys for now   haha. There's also   <a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1393219562435346432?s=20" target="_blank"><b>SID's new single</b></a>  which I'm still hesitating to even give them or not. Well, come back next   week and we see if I have to do a review of this single track single lol </div>    <br />    On news concerning music that is on Twitter mostly from people I follow because if I don't follow them means I may not catch up with their news, I did listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1390634061153013763?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff's recent live video</a>    before it expires at Friday and did end up giving a song from their best album 2 years ago so we shall see for that I am just 2 years too late lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1393883935071870976?s=20" target="_blank">SID's recent live revealed their new song for Anime</a></b>    which is great news in a while considering they are running low in recent years, the hint from last week was rather obvious so <b><a href="https://twitter.com/skream_japan/status/1392026942417690625?s=20" target="_blank">The Floor is releasing a new mini-album in July</a></b>    which is long time hype tbh, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1392706206070820867?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari is doing a collaboration single with Kameda Seiji</a></b>    which I doubt you know him because I don't (haha), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/toysfactory/status/1392495027222368259?s=20" target="_blank">Komatsu Mikako's album in 2018 is finally available in music     streaming</a></b>    I WAITED THREE YEARS FOR THIS well only gave two songs so lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/vividundress/status/1393175762056798217?s=20" target="_blank">vivid undress' new music video</a></b>    is a great start to their new release next month, the <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1393192623611912194?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail official Twitter gotta flex on how Amamiya Sora's new single is     featured</a></b>    in Apple Music Japan, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1392857912133885959?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new song is out on streaming</a></b>    which was a drama theme song if you need a reminder which is fine I guess see you in the next album haha, and interestingly <b><a href="https://twitter.com/neatsyui/status/1393492847316193283?s=20" target="_blank">Niitsu Yui's 2nd album is already in production but through a     customized mobile app</a></b>    (for now only available on iOS, later for Android) where you can watch behind-the-scenes for production and even participate in some of the proceedings. Man, that's actually cool you come up with the Android version then we shall see haha oh also it costs 1000yen a month for who knows how long it can be years lol GOTCHA<br />    <br />    So next week where I have to work all week unlike the week after we actually only have the one single to listen!?? Oh well, I'll still give chance to <b>DIALOGUE+'s new single</b>. It's produced by that one guy in UNISON SQUARE GARDEN anyways so I'll give him a chance to say the least. I have also <strike>watched</strike> listened to the music video so I know I will still give it anyways haha- Oh <b>wacci's new single</b> is out next week too? I'll listen to that.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    I mean, I can let the below postscripts deal with the outro here, but I think I should close it properly, huh. They do say pictures speak better than words so I rather let them do the talking lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time it's going to be another rough week for me at least but consolation is near the end of this month so I'll be looking forward to that to say the least. I have scanned but not yet started editing on that stack of bromides I bought just because I wanna play video games and chill all day haha I'll get to them in the next week or the week after latest anyways I didn't even bother to catch up on the main story on that one mobile game I've played since 5 years ago wow man their (and my) 5th anniversary is coming up soon in July maybe it's time to quit *laughs* Like seriously, DOAXVV is still the only game I get satisfaction with the grinding haha *fap fap* I'm trying to bait ma bro to join me but he's so stuck with that ninja girl mobile game so...<br />  </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.S.
