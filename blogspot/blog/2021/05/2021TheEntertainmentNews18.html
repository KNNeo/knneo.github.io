Yeah, I did. Had   a real great nap after the cycling trip in the morning. This is how normies   live their lives now? Okay, maybe I should start hanging out with friends like my sis   does with Zoom now just because, but you know, I rather stay at home and play   video games haha ugh I hate myself </div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways! It's May now, and how fast time will pass because besides being a month   of nothing but holidays (three, actually, including yesterday which   technically doesn't count since I didn't work...?), it's also going to be the   month of packages in quite a while! So I'll be looking forward to that. Sadly   it won't come together because that warehouse can't store stuff for more than   a month, so it'll come in two waves, I guess. You know, enjoying this   happiness of burning shipping fees before the government comes in to tax my sh*t in a couple of years   haha<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo05">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "It's hard to hold back something you enjoy" Haha Ryou ikr just like my       love for this Anime in general tbh but you see&nbsp;my friends don't give a       shit (lol)     </div>  </blockquote>  I guess we have all the accomplices ready for this school trip. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Don't   worry, Ryou; Masuda and your sister will have you covered to make sure you get   the best experience of Ichika-chan without going there haha so stop applying for that business trip you twerp lmao. In this new   episode as mentioned above (#KoiKimo05), I am actually relieved we don't have   Ryou on our backs this time around lmao. Yeah, Ryou raging in jealousy of his   bro being able to join the class in Okinawa is the best haha. Anyways, let's   talk about the highlights of the class' trip to Okinawa. Surprisingly, Okinawa   is not going to be the focus of this episode haha. No really, stop being a   tourist for a moment and look at the spicy drama here lol. So firstly, Masuda's appearance   as a photographer in this school trip. I didn't know they hire photographers   to take pictures of the class in school trips. Without permission might not be   in the requirements of this job scope but still. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> At least you won't   have to take shots with your uPhone X or something since we got DSLRs around.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> ("What's the difference" lol) Anyways, we got more for later, but we be talking about Matsushima   again this quickly? Hmm, I wonder why... so Ryou sort of found out that his   co-worker is into Anime mainly because Ichika liked the same thing which is   probably why he knows it now or else he will be his own unknowledgeable self   tbh, but suffice it to say he got into a conversation with her and... yeah.   Someone got excited. Won't say who but it's not Ryou. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Now that I had   a closer look at Matsushima, there are ZERO similarities between her and the   voice behind her <i>especially</i> with that rack haha Kana-chan please don't   hit me) Point taken though, whatever Matsushima might be involved in this   series in the future. Moving on, the kids were in an aquarium (Hey <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-24kAzsvoF-w/YJP08S8n_oI/AAAAAAABELg/T48GvGRvvoYm4SHWlMWKQN0qbde0_l-vQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PXL_20210426_035411836.jpg" target="_blank">I was at my  local aquarium</a> just earlier this week!) (And sorry for the terrible selfie; I   have no one else to test this on lol) Ichika got lost with her friends somehow   which is fine until you realize her phone's battery got cut off (buy a new   phone, girl, or at least ask Ryou to get you one) (lol), and Tamaru... let's   just say if you didn't notice at this point he has very... obvious intentions   on Ichika-chan here already at this point, if you haven't noticed by the end   of this episode tbh. Too bad Masuda got in the way, and we will soon realize   how much of an informant this dude will be to Ryou since he effectively saw   EVERYTHING. With his camera of course, so basically paparazzi. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ryou   thought Masuda was joking about being in Okinawa, and got Ichika's   confirmation via their usual phone call. (Rio be like "oh God it's not that   nightly call again" lol) And&nbsp;instead of telling Ryou that having Masuda   and Rio around without him is GREAT (haha), Ichika told him the opposite. Oh   well, we in this deep already huh. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yeah, that elbow drop of Tamaru   against the wall eavesdropping was meant for Ryou. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, we got   some free time before the school trip's over. And what better to spend it on   than... hang out with Tamaru? Eh? Ichika-chan, you okay? Ah, "Anime scene   pilgrimage", huh. What a nice cover, Tamaru-kun. Masuda's going to find out   about that too, bro. You egging him now? Haha goddamn this is something.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> (Tamaru even thought Masuda was some jerk trying to touch up on   Ichika-) As we have seen so far, we know that Ichika is just nice in general   to everyone around her including jerks who come for her even though they are a   decade older (lmao), so when it comes to a point where she has to make a   decision... it might be rough for her especially considering what we have so   far, and I tell you, this is going to be as exciting as it gets.&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/seishun" target="_blank">Youth</a>, they call it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Haha Ryou we can hang out we can't hang around too   much with the kids lol. I wonder what is worse though comparing to current   trends: Falling in love with Ryou or falling in love with their teacher in high school...   wait, what's the difference? *got woke* Haha we might see this happen earlier   than we think considering everyone around in this series tbh. Last but not   least, because Ichika had to give her souvenir to Ryou instead of passing it   through the sister like how anyone else would, she got rewarded with a movie.   And mostly because that someone missed the girl, it's also because Ryou heard   of a lot of things from his buddy that this is confrontation time baby!! MASUDA YOU F**KING RAT!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, what did I tell you on this intro. For   a change, they watched a movie which Ryou would enjoy... but I don't think   that might be a good idea after all. Yeah, just watch like, Toy Story or   something so no romance will be involved. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Yeah Ichika, you may be   feeling fine but Ryou... <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> All in all, fantastic episode in   terms of plot advancement, plenty to absorb though I must say and as you can   see from this review, but man things are going FAST haha. Even Ichika's   worried about her appearance effectively dating a dude 10 years older than   her- Wait, WE DATING NOW?? WHAT ABOUT TAMARU??? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> More spiciness coming   up I guess. But as I said, Ichika is not going to go anywhere but   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojak" target="_blank">Rojak</a> if she   keeps being nice to every guy around her life. Including me, if I was in her   life lol okay bye</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mP1GkW-YHog/YI6AIsauDoI/AAAAAAABEGU/YIFKetl6q707CuxWqzsTfCjufxw8GktpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo05_masuda2.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              They say birds of the same feather flock together so<br />(Yeah what a freakin' light bulb)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yPCFznBVQg8/YI6AJkOfMPI/AAAAAAABEGY/zlA_qWIPu6Y7f3Y4_aS4YTAIoe1wobOvACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo05_couple2.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              They say birds of the same father flock together so<br />(Like               dude, you be glad Ichika didn't slap you with her other hand)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Who's stopping       you? "Sure" Haha see?<span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  Besides, Sayu-chan, you don't have to do chores 24/7. There's something called   "work shifts", remember? You can work an afternoon shift instead of being   bored and mas*****ting at home. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, maybe she did miss that   "job" lol.&nbsp; In this new episode (#HigeHiro04) where we finally got over the   awkwardness of Yoshida not f**king this high schooler lol, you think she'll   make friends with her Hokkaido classmates when they have a school trip to Tokyo?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, tell me this can only happen in this Anime, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, we got a new girl to introduce since Sayu-chan immediately got her job at the   convenience store as if they were desperately hiring people lol. (Must be the blowjobs-) We   got a new girl in town, mainly because Sayu-chan doesn't want to rot at home every day which isn't a bad idea until you realize you have   to stand up for yourself at some point. No really, stop leeching on poor   Yoshida he still has Gotou and Mishima to feed. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, this   Asami... she may be high schooler but she looks like 27. Yoshida, you keen on   this one? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also, dear   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gal</a>, if the guy   wasn't a decent person she wouldn't even have a chance at working part-time   because she's so busy doing part-time sucking- ANWYAYS haha, story. Story goes Asami is real   good at reading people but also because Yoshida is a bad liar, but then again   who wouldn't be worried if you hear that your female co-worker is living with   some dude who before this series started was just an acquaintance on the   streets? So yeah, she did her field research including talking to the liars, tasting the great cooking lol, but yeah, she gotta dish Yoshida out personally so she can   ask for the truth. Thankfully, Yoshida decided to keep matters on their side   and let Sayu-chan do the talking instead of just giving the answers outright   like this, which is a wise choice to be honest. And since Asami has heard   enough, she left for home herself. Also, so Yoshida doesn't know where she   stays lol (<b>This</b> <b>one</b> is the real prostitute lmao ah hey) She also warns Yoshida   of her many smiles of which most of them are fake but we got that covered in   the past couple of episodes so we good, dear gal. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> It just keeps   happening though, as we move on from another person who wants to dig into   Sayu-chan's past. Remember that dude Hashimoto which is effectively Yoshida's   buddy at work who knows EVERYTHING? Yeah, we already know he is the author in disguise lol.   Mishima knows about the whole situation so basically this trio is a gang now,   Gotou feels like she's missing out on this scoop, so just like a nice superior   and boss she treats Yoshida out for dinner and make him ditch Sayu alone at   home. Aw and Mishima still walked in with two cups of drinks...!!! OOF. BIG OOF. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, am I liking this whatever harem thing here   lol. We then found out that Sayu-chan isn't the only big liar here because   despite all the confession and rejection Yoshida got from this beautiful   woman, she now turns the story back at the guy who she rejected and said the   thing. Yep. THE BUDDY WAS RIGHT haha like no shit, dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> IT'S THE   RESURGENCE lol hey I like how the author is right about himself. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>   Anyways, it's not that, because Gotou didn't have a boyfriend to begin with, the   rejection was technically a farce so she can have some time to think   about it, and with Sayu's help effectively this brewing is going real well   haha. Well I think we know Gotou is not being honest enough at this point, really. (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/la-noire-doubt-press-x-to-doubt" target="_blank">Press X to doubt!</a>  Press X to doubt!!) So instead of letting him do the honours again, he is   going to let Gotou do the confession, whenever she is ready. I mean, it's   mutual, we know he can wait to lay his hands on those boobs (lol), so yeah,   why not wait longer? <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (Now it's F cup you can touch versus I cup you can touch lmao) I mean, Yoshida's life just got better all because of   that one girl. Just like Asami said "you can choose who to hang out with, but   you can't choose who you meet". I know right, where's the STD-ridden high schooler on the streets in which I can pick her up lmao. Last but not least, we have some flashbacks. Don't be   too happy though; Those were Sayu's flashbacks. Uh oh. Yep, she got those   anxiety streaks. Don't worry, been there done that. But serious talk though,   Sayu-chan? Find happiness somewhere else, maybe with Asami or whatever.   Yoshida is going to get you nowhere. I know I say that for a fact, but she   still won't care and like Mishima and now Gotou, they are ALL going to go for   this one dude who is technically a criminal now, by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And   surprisingly, Yoshida is taking Gotou to his place ie. this place lol to see   Sayu-chan?? So next episode, I guess we are cleaning up the mess that is   Sayu-chan now. Ah hey, you see, that's how Gotou can actually go out with   Yoshida haha she was in the way lol. Hey, reality check incoming, I guess.   Which probably also means we will know more about Sayu's past soon enough.   Trust me, you don't want to know. But hey, we have come this far, and this   series is actually real good up till now, so you know, I'll suffer a little   bit of dark past if that is fine with me, me. Haha cya guys next week for   more- Why am I watching nothing but harem this season? lol </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w0vyCJcW1pk/YI6BAlALq3I/AAAAAAABEG0/n7S3JoXnsREQ-SKoM_UrKmJUKE3d-xrOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro04_mishima1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              The women in this series are very, very aggressive I must say<br />(<span title="*thumbs up*">👍</span>)</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kn4Ui6LgJy4/YI6BBAnbnbI/AAAAAAABEG4/gH_KZZ54bPQhRFwpmEzzTcgmmjBcmwkngCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro04_yoshida5.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW someone says she wants to have sex with me lol             <br />(Also MFW some woman says she's a virgin)</td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S. *holds Yoshida* "Why didn't you tell me about all this?"

Anyways, story. It's the day of the   school festival in case you forgot which is the parent of which FYI the   Confession thing is just part of the actual festival. The class did do some cafe thing too just   so we can relate maybe, and don't ask me where Shirokusa is in this because   she's already losing without showing up dressing cute like Kuroha so I don't   know why she gotta ask the dude up to the stairs to the rooftops to reveal her   past to him like we don't know about it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I swear Sueharu is like "Wow you and Kachi-san's past sounded real similar up till now- Wait." lol haha ikr how   long did it take you to notice that, bro? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, blah blah blah you   thought this was drama but it's not and it's all new to the main guy somehow, but   yeah, Kuroha was listening downstairs. I mean, on the stairway? I probably can hear that from the first floor lol schools in Japan aren't exactly tall it's only like 4   floors max like any other school haha. (You think Shiro will think this through but nope) The two childhood friends tease each other like <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35860/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san" target="_blank">Takagi and Nishikata</a> lol (Like seriously, where's the part where these two <i>accidentally</i> have   sex? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, that's&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/R18" target="_blank">R18</a>? Okay, leave that aside for now haha), they then went on a stroll around the   school, and then she slapped him. You know, so we can do the "I've   done my job" thing and leave him to decide who he actually wants to confess to   in this Festival, to be honest. Remember, this thing is all about revenge;   It's revenge against Shirokusa trying to go out with the senpai and rejecting   Sueheru in the first place. Think about it for a while, and read on. So, the actual farce.   I call it a farce for good reason, and I appreciate you stay along with me   till the end to find out why. It starts with the most popular <a href="https://jisho.org/search/senpai" target="_blank">senpai</a> on stage,   singing and dancing to his beloved Shirokusa (What song is this, 2005?) (Haha   this is going into the soundtrack, this original song...?) until Sueharu slid in smoother than Michael Jackson lol. One should have noticed by now on where's the rivalry   part of this revenge, so to say. So surprise surprise, Sueharu's the one doing   the confession(?), he started with Shirokusa but THEN talked about his real   childhood friend and mother (lol) Kuroha which probably blew her mind   considering she ditched him like a moment ago, and... she said no. Yeah, they   are all losers now lmao. Think about it: It was for the revenge, so confessing   to Shirokusa wouldn't even be an option in the first place. Why get back on   your first love by confessing TO your first love? Then, I guess the flashback   did a good job, but Sueharu has Kuroha with him all this time. From when she consoled him because he got duked on by this liar of a Shirokusa who can't get over her pride to be   honest, to when they had to fake as a couple lol, and basically so far into   his life. Why not confess to Kuroha instead? Is probably what the guy is   thinking, but he'll be totally wrong. Since for reals, Kuroha is never going   to accept him just because they are childhood friends for so long, and support   is never better represented unless you <b>don't</b> become lovers. Especially when   she said no. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So basically, if you don't get my warped explanation,   and as mentioned by Tetsuhiko and Abe-senpai, the two girls are both losers.   No one won, especially with Sueharu going in the wrong direction. It's quoted   as revenge right from the start though, it's understandable, but   nonetheless... you get the idea by now. Also, this is a romcom, so I hope you   expected an ending somewhere along these lines lol. And if you noticed gaps in   the story like I did, don't forget my review of Episode 1 and like everyone   else in the story right now, let's move on. And that is the end of this arc.   And the rest of the series won't matter anymore now that we know blatantly   this is a love comedy series and there will be no conclusion lol. But hey,   we aren't nearly done yet.

It's bliss when it's Sakura Ayane and Minase Inori in both of your ears seducing you in the B-side; It's quite an experience. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> (Someone please send help haha also sexy Inorin fanclub content please lol) ("Only" sexy Inorin, sorry) (Haha) (Audience: So what type of content will it be...?) (I don't know come up with something so I can continue my yearly subscription haha I don't care if it's her half naked-) I also gave <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/terminal/1559690822?l=en" target="_blank">YUKI's new album</a></b> a listen which probably compensated for the one time I heard her new single from a month ago because I gave it anyways, the topic song, one of them.

To add on, I went for a search on what anewhite was doing and saw them already being way more successful than when I saw them on a rock festival from last year so I'll be listening to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E3%82%92%E6%8A%9C%E3%81%91%E3%81%A6/1562255994?l=en" target="_blank">anewhite's 2nd EP</a></b> which was actually released within the week. Never too late, I guess; It's technically still a new release. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span><br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  I've been thinking about this for a while though well about a month already to be honest, I should review another photobook just like how I did buying one from a local bookstore from two years ago. Well, the birthday and friend thing we can skip here (We're still BFFs though I just didn't ask him out to exchange photobooks lmao because pandemic and he wasn't keen anymore I suggested Miku's new photobook because he likes the girl), but I think I can review a photobook from last year. You know, Hanazawa Kana before she was married maybe? So yeah. Problem is, this isn't readily available on the store because I guess she was popular? (Sorry Marinka) So if I do so it'll have to arrive as import for a couple of weeks I imagine. I'll have a lot of holidays on leave from work this month coming so hopefully I'll have the time to take a look IF I do click on the order button though. I want to continue the trend from 2 years ago. I want to make the magic happen. If someone announced a photobook right now I would've lined this all up, but no. No cigar. So yeah. That's why I'm stuck between the two worlds of whatever awesome blog post and my wallet to be spent on Japan once again. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So you see, it wasn't going to be an easy decision haha. Cya guys next week then, and until then...
