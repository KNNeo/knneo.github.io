<h2>The Entertainment News 2021 Edition Issue #22</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HY5p7sQ2fLw/YLN5rv4rPTI/AAAAAAABE4s/I1H6Rk4RwQYDZfqjaY1-KP1vwPfdFDCnACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/osamake07_ehe.gif" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>You know how your mom likes to ruin your random Sunday morning? I compensated it with signing up for Kouno Marika's fan... app. ðŸ˜† Yeah, maybe I should talk a little about that she's not going to get a write-up like Inorin and we'll talk about why. <div><br /></div><div>  In a nutshell, you can see fan content including her self made content,   radio shows and photos and images as it's shown similar to her Instagram page... but ONLY using the mobile app, which took me   some time to download because it's region blocked but only AFTER I signed up   for it without using the app which feels ironic considering that registration should be   done on the app so that people will know its restrictions first, and that it also has the same issue on sign up as "Inori Machi" which required a... residential phone number in Japan. So thanks, Inorin! ðŸ˜† </div><div><br /></div><div>  Not going to expect a lot of online content in this though similar to Kitou Akari <strike>or even if I don't get to access the   fan club&nbsp;since I can't download the app</strike> because honestly, by signing up before next Wednesday?   I can get Marinka to write <a href="https://knwebreports.blogspot.com/2020/11/that-time-i-got-myself-japanese-name.html">my name</a> on the membership card. This is the best   fan club sign up yet HAHAHA *dabs*<br />  <br />Anime and music, shall we? I can't talk about idolism for too long lol   yeah tell your past self about this dude ðŸ˜†<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo09">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "Are you sure you want to do it here?" Oi Tamaru you can't say that- Hey   Ryou nononononono (Haha) </div>  </blockquote>  Please Ichika-chan please say no to this dude please or else I'll stop   watching... "There's someone else I like" Okay good ðŸ˜† In this new   episode where as you can see... (#KoiKimo09) Wait wait Ryou she can explain!!!   ðŸ˜† Uh, is this even infidelity? Ah, probably not, huh. It's complicated,   alright?? ðŸ˜† Hey opening theme, took you a while haha okay story. Story   goes Ichika was prepared to meet Tamaru for her answer to his confession some   time ago, if you would remember last episode basically, and that got her   maiden heart troubled *resists to sing opening theme chorus* and people around   her too, but she got around it finally, and... yes thank goodness Tamaru got   rejected because amongst all things that will make this infinitely more   complicated, looks like we're not going in that direction after all. Hmm... And   they met Ryou on the way to the station. ðŸ˜† I swear if I'm Tamaru I'll   also tell the truth, but I'll also tell Ryou that Ichika liked someone else   and if it isn't him... well I'm leaving first bye ðŸ˜† Well, thank goodness this   series isn't like this, amirite?? So yeah, Tamaru told Ryou off somehow   because he technically is always throwing his weight around even if he sees a   little of a love rival, and that I think that might be what the author is trying to   convey to us: Those subtle advances or not, and Ryou's exaggerated reactions to   them, whether Ichika is okay with it or not. Because seriously, till the end   if he is concerned about her affairs, he shouldn't even let Ichika worry   about... you know, him. Liking him or not or whatever, Ryou shouldn't really   be talking his way into his crush who, even at this point, is only doing   nothing but pushing him away. For Ichika though... I mean, it's complicated,   it'll take a while, so we will have to wait haha. So yeah, turns out Tamaru is   the good guy haha what. ðŸ˜† Talking about good guys, the students were   good enough to help out the useless teacher (lol) to draw up the classroom   whiteboard for their seniors' graduation, just like how it's normally done if   you didn't know about those. Yeah, the drawings (On the chalkboard? For goodness sake, who uses those?) will be gone by the end of the day so it's a   kinda wasted effort for decoration, but you know, Rio just "negotiated" some   drinks for the three... for all those who participated haha so like five people once the   other two joined. Before that though, since this was after the rejection from   Ichika, she and Tamaru are just acting weird in front of Rio, who again,   besides concerned about her friend, may have been pushy about her personal   affairs. Surprisingly though, it's Ichika who managed to settle it herself, so   good on you girl, the friend wouldn't have to worry about her in   the first place, to be honest. Just that you know, awkwardness after that drop   will be unavoidable, so it's that transition phase to get through, I guess. I   mean, I don't experience that stuff so you tell me. *wink* (Well mine was way more   awkward so) Anyways, moving on, Ryou has a presentation to give. To Ichika.   About White Day. What. ðŸ˜† Okay Ryou listen up: It was a great   Valentine's Day gift from Ichika-chan but you don't have to make yours a   presentation or anything Ichika's wasn't that complicated lmao. No really,   it's very simple; I can explain this using 0 presentation slides haha ANYWAYS   we are still hinted of Ichika's feeling towards this jerk which till this day   still is her definition of love which I must say, I'm so sorry for your high   school days because this guy just crashed in and straight off ruined it lol. Then again,   tell me which kids nowadays weren't dating before they graduate middle school?   Haha okay maybe it's just me. Also, who's that dude watching over them at the cafe??   ðŸ˜† Last but not least, and man was I excited when I hear her talk to herself in the   bathroom, it's Matsushima's "date" with Ryou. So yeah, the dude doesn't know   he's going for drinks with her only (oh?), Matsushima got so nervous she   had to go to the toilet and thankfully didn't come up with more makeup or   something lol (Isn't that what most girls do? I don't know haha), and then   slipping into her talk with Ryou's crush which she did hear of previously,   confessed to him (yes!) and asked... what's the difference between her and Ichika...   apparently. Yes, and this has to happen sooner or later, she also did the age gap   mention. So, in an effort to find Ryou out, which is why Matsushima keeps   asking questions so she can <strike>cater to her client</strike> attract his   attention which honestly saying makes her a more prospective partner than someone who   is a decade younger than you but thinking back... Does it even make much sense   to say that the age gap would link to Ichika being unhappy? I don't know man,   you tell me on those 52-25 relationships (common term in Chinese to show   significant age gap, but numbers have to be mirrored) if any of them lasted long enough haha. Then again, I don't think that's what the author will be   emphasizing because that's every other real life drama series so... yeah, I   guess it's Ryou's turn to be confessed to, and think about all the stuff   Ichika has been feeling about him from last week haha. Hmm... this is turning out to be more   interesting than I thought, this episode. Yeah, it's like this huge trap I'm   dropping into it and I can't run away from it and you KNOW it's good so you   wouldn't even complain. That's what you call a great Anime production haha no   really, this is literally it, the stuff you want to see in a romance series   and production really making this scriptwriting flow properly so the drops   happen at the right places. And looks like the next episode is the pain   episode, not this one apparently. Uh oh, we might... be into more of this huge   whirlpool and it's only getting deeper and I LOVE IT haha cya </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8UTwgODGbd0/YLN8IOOJcYI/AAAAAAABE5Q/gzfDIRsDGZo5zJF8DC1Um6_dnldY1YShQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo09_couple6.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Ryou how can you be around with so many women(?)

OOF haha I don't think Ichika will take that, Tamaru </div><div>  P.P.S. "I think it's even more immature for you (Ryou) to use your older age   against me (Tamaru)" How many female fans do you think Tamaru has killed with   this one liner? ðŸ¤­ Not me I'm totally hetero ðŸ˜† </div><div>  ["Can it not be me?" Man <strike>Matsushima</strike> Kana-chan if you had   confessed to me BEFORE you got married IRL I wouldn't even say no ðŸ˜† I   KNOW!! ARGH SCREW ICHIKA AMIRITE??

Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "Yoshida-senpai's not going to drop dead if you (Sayu) don't do the   chores" Haha Mishima best joke this episode lol but what if he does...   ðŸ˜† </div>  </blockquote>  Well worst case scenario to Yoshida is just his house gets messy again, isn't   it? But hey, this time around, I'm pretty sure someone else around him will   help him with housework. Willingly, even. ðŸ¤­ Hey, in this new episode   (#HigeHiro08) where I almost forgot Sayu just avoided her brother stomping   into her place of work and got guarded by the guy who raped her before lol   (hey this series is complicated, what can I say), she still dared to walk down   the streets buying groceries with the bodyguards searching for her around   town?? Man, this is dumb haha. Anyways, Mishima to the rescue since she was watching movies alone? (I'm so sorry for you, girl, but if you really need a date I   can join you haha call me Aozaki-senpai *dabs*) Sayu spotted the brother   again, and of course, since Mishima kinda knows something about her thanks to   Yoshida, she helped her hide in a karaoke bar instead of going straight home?   I don't know if that is good or not but hey, maybe the brother already stoked   out the abode so they can't go back? Hey Anime logic you tell me. Anyways,   we're obviously not here to sing songs because Mishima is too old to know what   kids want these days (okay can we stop with the burns here? ðŸ˜†) so yeah, hard to avoid not talking about her situation and I mean Sayu's,   considering the minimum room time is an hour I assume? So yeah, Mishima asked   about Sayu's current situation right now, and of course realizing that someone is coming for this girl means she doesn't have much time left, just like how   we found that out since last week. Just that yeah, it's way faster than you   think. "So think right now, girl." Oh yeah, you bet assertive Mishima is   pushing it. Hey, she's getting the most out of this hour of karaoke session   she gotta get her answer out of someone and it's not Yoshida so... ðŸ˜†   Because how to say, no matter where this goes, whether is Sayu never wanting   to go back so she can carve out a life here in Tokyo, or going back and face   the consequences potentially, she still has to make a decision that everyone   can follow her through so you know, she can actually move in the direction   that she desires, hopefully not getting her rear ripped open, for her sakes.   ðŸ˜† But meanwhile, while we get this over with, Yoshida is here to   save her every single time, and that people around her including Mishima are   only going to get sadder about this wonderful relationship which is somehow   right now, slowly becoming an obligation. (Remember, it was really just   because Yoshida took a JK in for the night OUT OF PITY so she wouldn't stay on the   streets) And Mishima cried. Yep, second guessed that from a mile away where   Sayu's brother was standing lol. Damn, Yoshida, you don't know how many girls   you have made cry just not in front of you haha *sigh* Anyways, moving on, and   probably the highlight of the episode because why not some fanservice while   we're at it, it's summer! But instead of going to the beach because looks like   we don't have much time to be ogling at bikini but seriously imagine how great   it would've looked on Gotou-san (hahahahahaha) AND they be going to the summer   festival together- WHAT DID WE JUST SAY ABOUT NOT F**KING AROUND BECAUSE THERE   ISN'T MUCH TIME LEFT?? ðŸ˜† Hey, don't quote me on this but we gotta see   some yukata shot first before we send her home haha. *Anime director mode   activated* The couple had a wonderful time of course, Yoshida almost came with   excitement and I'm pretty sure he's into JKs now lol, Sayu is enjoying her   time with Yoshida somehow while totally forgetting her objectives at this   point, and I think we have been given enough hints about what Mishima is   talking about them being psychologically bounded together at this point or   whatever. It may not be obvious, but man, is it showing. And guess who dropped   by the next day at Yoshida's place. ðŸ˜† All in all... great development   we have here in terms of plot. Finally, FINALLY, we are getting to the main   point. But as you can see, a lot of loose ends that refuse to be tightened, or   even be untangled so I won't say too much because I'd like to see the upcoming   episodes do it for themselves, so hopefully we will see a great ending ahead   of us, whether good or bad. Especially important, considering the original novel   series has ended. Yes, I think I may have mentioned that in passing, but yeah,   this is probably the only show this season I watch that will have a canon   ending. Hopefully. We don't know. If not, I also don't know how you can settle   this now the brother's up on stage. Hey, we shall see, we shall see. </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JJzKXOxnnpY/YLN8y6XMh4I/AAAAAAABE5g/avdLnOx2h1Amm_NHNWnSbnQ9UgkZW9zUgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro08_couple1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      This is not even a triangle relationship...  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3baZ7x8CSw0/YLN8zp7352I/AAAAAAABE5k/wN5ExagtcUIQ6lRX7lbrL--9hDgxeZ_ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro08_mishima4.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      ...and I can already feel the pain in Mishima's heart  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

And I like how Kuroha is like "go figure it   out" haha THIS is what it's like to be a dude, ladies. You keep telling us   to use our man brains when it's smaller than an ant's lmao </div>  </blockquote>  Okay let us list down the number of times Sueharu has been lied to just for   the years he has lived.ðŸ˜† But hey, you're still young bro you can still   be lied to to join the entertainment industry- Ah. ðŸ˜† In this new   episode where I think we should really encourage more violence than talk   because I'm getting bored of the dialogues already lol (#OsaMake07), I really   thought we will move on from last <strike>arc</strike> week but hey Sueharu,   didn't know your devil is LITERAL SATAN haha how did he get into   your mind I don't even want to know. ðŸ˜† Firstly, continuing from last week.   Last week Kuroha got leaked (lol okay me) about her faking of amnesia to her   childhood friend which probably threw dumb idiot Sueharu into a rage but you   know, <i>he isn't supposed to know about it</i> lol. It progressed into throwing   insults at each other which I like only one side of it (haha Inorin more   please) but other than that it has only gotten more awkward since then, and   just like them normally, it's only going to get worse. We'll talk about how   that gets settled later, but for now, in welcoming Maria-chan's... sudden   transfer of high school lmao she literally said she did it with money and fame   so whatever, we find out a little more about this   <strike>Aquamarine</strike> Gunjou Channel because I'm not a dork who can't   read Japanese for shit also because Gunjou is shorter lol. ðŸ˜† Anyways, about their channel, to simplify   there are official and unofficial members, which the former partakes in   proposals ie. projects to promote the channel of course, have some form of   veto which we'll probably not need to see it in action because this is not the   G5 conference haha, and the latter is just here to vote. Or record everything   as evidence, Rena-chan. ðŸ˜† Anyways, we off to a great start with a   swimsuit music video suggestion haha (Hey, they say you only need to make one   friend in life even if he uses you for his own benefit but ðŸ˜†) but of   course the girls wouldn't be too happy about it, so Shirokusa suggests   removing the swimsuit part and it gets passed. Who voted for yes here... it's   not hard to think about it despite it being anonymous voting system. Shirokusa   gets her plan in place with only Kuroha's family joining in on Day 2 because   it's hard to coordinate her other three sisters for this anyways, so yeah, win   win win because Tetsuhiko too he gets to watch the drama happen haha. (No,   it's three wins it's not a typo Sueharu wins too) Next up, it's the regular   Shida-chan visit to Sueharu's place to clean his mess up   <strike>because he's a dirty-</strike> Ironically, he lets her in on the   relationship between him and the childhood friend ie. Kuroha not Aoi-chan here   of course, just because the sister can't help but be worried about them   anyways. I'll let genius level Aoi-chan do the analysis because I feel the   same girl these two lovebirds should just explode already lol, but serious   talk though Sueharu has more capacity to resolve this awkwardness between them   right now then the other party so yeah, good guy Sueharu has to do his thing   again and <strike>let her suck his</strike> apologize to his childhood friend   at some point, so yeah hopefully that happens before Shirokusa hits him so   hard he has to marry her to make up for the sex- Man, this imouto advice from   Aoi-chan is hitting Sueharu so hard, we almost forgot this is a harem.   ðŸ˜† Don't ask me how Tetsuhiko is immune to this lmao. In more surprising   news that'll blow your mind lol, Shirokusa is enjoying her success thanks to   Tetsuhiko in exchange of reserved accomodation haha nice, Aoi-chan warns   Sueharu of getting laid on a trip like this just like anyone in an Anime would   lol, and turns out Tetsuhiko had a sister from a different mother, and that is   the reason why there's the one unofficial member in the club. *wink* I'm sure   that last bit will come in handy somehow (as in handjobs-) (please, me) (haha)   but moving on, we're finally on the day for the trip! Bear in mind this is the   one WITHOUT Kuroha (and her sisters so sadded haha ah-) so yeah, just two of   them will be enough trouble already huh, Sueharu. ðŸ˜† So looks like going   forward, I assume these two for one episode next week, and then another   competition of sorts for another episode... ðŸ˜† What, you think this   series is not going to focus on what is more drama than this series will ever   get? That's ALL you're getting haha I'LL TAKE IT hehe cya guys soon </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nk7Y0StIEcQ/YLN6V_LQaXI/AAAAAAABE48/crTRbBCSK-kiXZry4YqTbhSQT_ec7EohACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake07_calendar.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Hey this is not what is on my Minase Inori calendar of October   2021!! lol  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bf2N-Y4h7P8/YLN6Vn0hZ8I/AAAAAAABE44/7N7F21jdeEIGhQiFPPOlg_ILaUGGrXkKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake07_harem1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Ah well we're done the childhood friend lost haha<br />(Refer to   series title)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VMU7gbEFG7A/YLN7Ly56G0I/AAAAAAABE5I/B4NZ5b8nAqsiW77yEvvIK-j_b5Ue-3jKACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake07_eavesdrop.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Okay I got real curious about this when I saw it so sorry for this   third image but WHO IS THIS??<br />(<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/196489/Shion_Ooragi" target="_blank">This girl</a>&nbsp;who hasn't appeared maybe)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

It's not much   but <b>Polkadot Stingray's new EP</b> did take the spotlight, so I'm basically   just listening to their songs for the week... until if I get burnt out I'll   just stop but you know, the release didn't really have all new songs one of   them was a remix and I just ended up going back to the album last year to   listen to it instead haha. No Klassic Note Review though, even though it was   close. So yeah, that was something. What wasn't something was   <b>Komatsu Mikako's new single</b> in 3 years because it's only available in   physical. Yes, it's still at that stage. If you see the TOYS FACTORY website   listing the single even the digital downloads were greyed out. You get it   right? They are popularity testing this release for her return of solo music   career, so it took me a while to leech off the Internet community to listen to   this just this weekend alone and... I'm glad I didn't have to buy it the   B-side wasn't even great lol (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvZXu011JL8" target="_blank">The signing event livestream</a>  IS great though hehe I just want to see more of her huh)<br />  <br />  On things concerning music that is on Twitter and I swear it's getting thinner   in recent weeks, I'll talk about   <a href="https://twitter.com/dkomusubi/status/1397164211487133706?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff's new EP</a>  releasing next week later,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1398202699041034254?s=20" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana is releasing a concept album in September</a></b>  ironically not consisting of new songs but just songs that bear the concept of   "food" as the theme apparently and of course includes a couple of new songs,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/marika_staff/status/1398232593363988480?s=20" target="_blank">Kouno Marika's new single preview</a></b>  is a total meh it's totally just Anime theme song cr*p so nope (haha),   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1398564778524569615?s=20" target="_blank">LuckLife is releasing another new song end of June</a></b>  which I swear their new album or something is near it has been a while, since   I've literally given   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/miyustaff/status/1398202392148013061?s=20" target="_blank">Tomiya Miyu's new music video</a></b>  I guess I'll be listening to her first album end of next month,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sambomaster_txt/status/1398927189786062849?s=20" target="_blank">Sambomaster is releasing a new song in a couple of weeks</a></b>  for some local drama so I'll listen to it then, and I guess if you are   interested in Rayflower or SID you can listen to their member combined group   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1398973955776552961?s=20" target="_blank">fuzzy knot's 1st album trailer on YouTube</a></b>  because it isn't too bad I might just listen to it.<br />  <br />So for next week as mentioned above if you didn't read it,   <b>cinema staff's new EP</b> is finally something to wait for because they   came up with no releases last year besides singing for that pandemic so ugh   haha, and since <b>Teshima Aoi's best album</b> is out soon and I've listened   to her all this while I should give this veteran a listen. Besides, it's been   a long time since I hear of some emotional and/or soft tunes so she might be   able to provide some. This year's special compilation, if more songs enter   that can fit in, will likely feature soft tunes, so I'm trying to add more to   the collection, so to say.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Oh, how was this week? Well, for starters, the company I work in did enforce   some work from home policy, but sadly, that does not mean I don't have to go   back to office now because it's alternate days, so basically I can list it out   now, (for at home) it's 2 and 4 for this week and alternate for next week. And   that's it, because that might be how long the restrictions apply so I assume   they won't extend this further. This week though? It was implemented on Monday   go office, my first day work from home was on a Wednesday which is a public   holiday so Tuesday go office, and the rest of the week was holiday or work   leave... well, almost. ðŸ˜† Because some idiot client decided to do   testing because they think they can push the project to go live early by this   week and I'm the only one in charge of the thing... yeah. ðŸ˜† Well don't   worry though since I worked from home this whole time, and yes, I got my leave   back because f**k this shit man haha<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, the intro was more interesting, isn't it? Haha hey at least I know the   next package is assembling like those superhero movie series you all love and   I don't, so yeah, hopefully we can get it together by the end of this month   this literally just appeared today. I guess Japanese don't take breaks huh lol   cya guys next week then take care...!!!~ (Oh that signed card is only   appearing in September ie. October before I see it for myself so I'll live on   till then... lol) </div><div><br /></div><div>  P.S. The Marinka fan app FYI was (1) because her current talent company and one   she changed to a year ago is pushing fan club apps for most of their talents <a href="https://c-rayon.com/news/20210510/" target="_blank">she was in round 2</a> and (2) <a href="https://c-rayon.com/" target="_blank">the developers</a> were also behind mainstream artist fan club apps so   yeah I rather <strike>sign up for this</strike>&nbsp;give money to her lmao</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2MleqiaqT0/YLOYYw4MZyI/AAAAAAABE6A/cJoyKt4c848LUD5H5YWnmN5kr9HHgoIOQCLcBGAsYHQ/s731/marikakohno-account-register-select-2021-05-30-21_49_53_LI.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="731" data-original-width="410" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2MleqiaqT0/YLOYYw4MZyI/AAAAAAABE6A/cJoyKt4c848LUD5H5YWnmN5kr9HHgoIOQCLcBGAsYHQ/w224-h400/marikakohno-account-register-select-2021-05-30-21_49_53_LI.jpg" width="224" /></a>  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    So, uh, "hotmail<u>.com</u>" is okay though??

Oh her first fan club livestream is on Tuesday, where I work from home and it's June 1st? I asked a question (in Japanese) using the app just now I hope she will look at it lol I asked why the lack of wearing skirts lmao haha is this sexual harassment (I am curious though!! It's summer too so there's no excuse lol)</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
