<h2>The Entertainment News 2021 Edition Issue #29 - Anime Extra</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOenM8EKbFM/YPULHjaXXcI/AAAAAAABGpM/4sRJ1omNe5wnNUOyo9N0G0dKVkTRqXZDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan03_inside2.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>AND WHO IS READY FOR MORE ANIME!!!!!!!! Haha hey this is literally the only thing I hype for right now apart from packages so let me have it okay?<div><br /></div><div>  So, I'm here because I don't have to work (yay) but also to do some conclusion   on whether to give all of these below or otherwise. Definitely giving "Shinigami   Bocchan" at this point to be frank, and "TanMoshi"... let's just say if I get   bored maybe I shouldn't be watching up to four shows this season. And yeah,   this is not even counting on "Sonny Boy" which kinda blew my mind yesterday   and... I don't even know if it's worth giving. Maybe fear of original series   being bad is a problem? Man a decade ago I was trying things out left and   right. </div><div><br /></div><div>  Maybe I'm getting old lol okay enough about me let's talk about a detective who is but a sidekick and a young master who can't touch living things haha BURNNNNNN </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TanMoshi03">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "It's true that the saliva of the world's cutest idol is smeared all over   my hands now, but it's not like I'm going to enjoy it later with a cotton   swab or something" Haha what AND he puts his hands back in his pockets? I see that's for later lmao </div>  </blockquote>  How many times <strike>Kimitsuka</strike> Kimizuka (oops) gotta explain to   people that he's not a famous detective? But she is, that girl. 😆 In this   new episode where Siesta's... consciousness lives on I guess (#TanMoshi03), man   you bet I am thinking about how much of a pill I need to swallow for this   series, ironically even more than "Sonny Boy". It's like making fun of the   dead. Worst thing is, we still haven't seen how she died- Okay story. 😆   Someone dropped by as in a new character did, introduced herself as Saikawa   Yui, local idol who we can just imagine is super famous at least within this   Anime world- IS THAT HOLOLIVE VTUBERS PROMOTING HER LIVE??? Okay I'm   out. 😆 Anyways, I'm not going to dabble on the changes of Siesta's   heart on Nagisa just because we will get to that at some point and will   talk about that later, but let's talk about Yui-nya? Haha I'm becoming a fan   too lol <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/39009/Kanon_Takao" target="_blank">this newbie voice actress</a> is going to get some unexpected popularity   because of this series now. And because Yui here accidentally jumped on   Kimizuka thinking he's the detective again lol why, but we did just went through   the "Siesta's heart is in me now" thing so yeah, gotta conclude that first I   guess. Next morning, Yui discusses about a couple of things which will of   course at this point, only make Kimizuka suspicious just because he did   inherit some analysis and thought from the master herself. So firstly, the   threat. I know it's dumb to imagine even if it's just Yui-nya here (ugh)   (haha) making this letter up I mean we can scan for fingerprints if you want,   but yeah, the police don't buy it, so she went for these two I guess to see   if they can prevent the family heirloom from being stolen in certainty. You   know, because there won't be any human security and the security system in   place within the big mansion might not be enough to prevent this- Wouldn't it   though? Press X to doubt haha. Anyways, that's the first thing, which will   bring us to the next part: Yui talking about her competition. Seeing that she   is the head of the household now that her parents have passed away (RIP), and   this idol thing is literally her job now, it will be no wonder why she hasn't   got rid of those VTubers who might be getting in her way of her idol career to   make sure all competition is eliminated- Maybe they got bought in   with money already haha they be promoting her live isn't it? 😆 Last   but not least, showing the difference of logic and analysis of Kimizuka, wait   for it, in comparison to Nagisa. So far this girl has only shown much emotion like a normal <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a> due   to her past and compassion because she be nice girl who lets people fondle her   chest and see her in a swimsuit lol Ayachi why (haha okay me), but let's just   say that also means the dude has seen through Yui and her tactics thinking that she   might have lied about the attempt to steal the family heirloom, probably to   distract them from something else or whatever I don't know but unlikely, but   you know, that room with treasures sure is a good place to suddenly trigger a security   lockdown, if any. 🤭 All in all... I still see no reason why I can't   give this series. It has jokes to laugh at, the theme songs are fine, it has   decent animation... yes we're talking about plot and worldview. My biggest   concern is again, as I have mentioned before, seeing Siesta's foretelling   being so good, it hinders the inference process typically done by the   audience. But this time around, Kimizuka is the one doing it. He's not as good   as Siesta, but also means that he doesn't do the reveal as fast or is as   invulnerable as her, which makes this more exciting of a mystery series to be   honest because we can do some second-guessing first and/or see him screw up once in a while. Imagine if there's always   a fall back like Siesta to solve every crime; Every crime will be solved and   there will be no exceptions. Which is why the lack of this is why I can still see myself giving it,   just like how Kimizuka can see a little of Siesta inside Nagisa here to think   she's the real thing. So yeah, we might finish this off considering this is a   one-cour series, and hopefully we'll not get to the point where I have to cry   over the reasons of a specific someone's death. Ironically, not shot on the heart would be   one of those reasons or else the story would've ended lol or maybe brain   transplant would've been better? Haha cya guys for this again I guess </div><div>  [TL:DR; "Where is all (Nagisa's) confidence coming from?" Haha I know right]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MI3flwKF51Q/YPUKMhG8_zI/AAAAAAABGo8/omik1XBpRB8O6fNc7akj8LVQw5eDyDmpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi03_vtubers2.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    I don't mean to know such "obscure references" but from left to right is  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdn5BQ06XqgXoAxIhbqw5Rg" target="_blank">Shirakami Fubuki</a>, Saikawa Yui (lol) and  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ0UDLQCjY0rmuxCDE38FGg" target="_blank">Natsuiro Matsuri</a>    with the other two as IRL virtual YouTubers   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3mtGCAO8wz4/YPUKNV7A3LI/AAAAAAABGpA/Q37bV1iLJRY9Rimdp_gjsrIJeYF7-BnVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi03_table.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Safe distancing measures at its finest I guess must be that idol having a     disease we call  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/moe" target="_blank">moe</a> lol   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div>  P.S. "Are you saying this whole nation is hopelessly corrupt from bottom to   top?" Yes. 😆&nbsp; </div><div>  P.P.S. "I wanted to put in running shoes and sprint around a track" Well,   that's everyone's wish as a kid until you grow up and be an adult and realize   you don't like that anymore and would rather stay at home and watch YouTube lol well stereotype talk right here folks</div><div>  [I really am filled with regret for even giving this series in the first   place especially that one-hour long first episode. Do I have to live on with   this just considering Nagisa-chan here? I may have to lol give me bikini next   week or I quit lmao] </div><div>  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="ShinigamiBocchan03">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Shinigami Bocchan to Kuro Maid</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "The loser has to do whatever the winner asks" Okay I see a trap in this   rule but who cares amirite we always come up tops haha (get it, trap) </div>  </blockquote>  Wow this is actually quite an episode which will solidify itself in terms of   perspective at least, as an imperfect love story. So, in   this new episode where now you can hear the   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCIBb0ROXAo" target="_blank">opening</a>  and   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql6ouR2NqN0" target="_blank">ending</a>  theme songs in full on YouTube by the way (#ShinigamiBocchan03), we have quite   a conclusion to whatever is between these two to be honest because there's one   thing good about your mother abandoning you alone in a big mansion is that   you can flirt with the maid as much as you want and not get scolded for it. *dabs*   Okay, story. Oh yeah, we started with Bocchan playing snooker or pool   depending on where you come from, and you know, what's a little fun if you   don't play with others, so Alice offers to play with a rule that the loser does whatever   the winner wants. You know, Bocchan will probably ask Alice to strip so that's   not much fun lmao we will see that later anyways lol, but yeah just flashing   herself will already make Bocchan lose at his feet so guess who's going to the   town with Alice haha. But yeah, we'll take this as a date, whatever. 😆   In order to prevent a death in this episode specifically can't say for any   other episode or non-human related deaths haha, but yeah, he gotta walk in   town which is having a festival right now in a steel cage so he looks like   what's that The Crow thing reference which I should be talking about right now? Haha   I don't know you tell me. Really could've made it lighter but maybe the   heavier burden would be good on wary for Bocchan himself so in case he gets   carried away by the crowd at least he won't suddenly kill someone- Okay I   should stop with the death jokes lol. So, two things that happened in general   on day time. Firstly, someone who recognized Alice's mother saw her in   town and mistook her as the mom, but did not offer to talk more and left. That would likely be a drop at   some point but we shall ignore that first I guess who knows what stories Alice   has to tell, but yeah, Bocchan got lost and is with a lost kid so yeah who's   the lost one now lol. He decides to play the piano at the town square to calm   the boy down and it did work, probably also attracting everyone to the square which should include the kid's mother and Alice so win-win I guess the town gets   to enjoy some great music while he's at it. (Also, great assessment on your   future prospects bro you are leaving the house to a stable life with reliable   income real soon haha) As the night sets in, the couple (I mean, they are)   talk about the moon and the story of a princess losing her beloved to a witch   who sent him to the moon... why are witches all so bad they should be called   b*tches- ANYWAYS haha, if we have to compare who's the sadder case, I must say   Alice is right these two are closer than those two with one of them on the   moon and space travel not even a thing yet I don't even think planes are a   thing even lol so yeah, they win. 😆 Still sad though, gotta say. Next   up, a night at Alice's room. 🤭 Not gonna comment on why she sleeps   like, in a shed away from the mansion or something lol, but yeah that is truly the place   where she can be free... of clothing apparently lol hey the Bocchan is onto it   I guess HAHAHAHA *thumbs up* She puts up some scented candles, gives him some   camomile tea which I must say does not work on me to help me sleep because I   probably have bigger problems on me lol (So wait, why are you drinking so fast bro? Haha), and lets him sleep on her bed... alone. 😆 What? The bed ain't big enough bro not when Alice is this thicc 😆 TWO Cs BRO, TWO   Cs!! 😆 But yeah, show's over haha but not the show we get to see in the   end so last but not least, Bocchan asks Alice out for some meteor shower   sights. Quoting from his sad past again 😢 he saw this fabulous spot for   shooting stars and knows it appears every once in a decade so let's assume   Bocchan is around 15 now haha, but yeah as you can guess instead of actually   looking at the stars and wishing that his curse could be removed (ah hey, not   my fault), they got themselves wet (lol), and we almost got Alice dead. So   yeah, they both know how to swim right? Or is the lake shallow enough to stand   on? Either ways, no one died so we get to see more antics another day lol, and   I guess Bocchan didn't get to confess his true feelings with a good   atmosphere. So yeah Alice, see you in ten years I guess lmao oh well he briefly said   it anyways lol. Hey we know, we get the idea. It's all good. *wink* All in   all, lovely episode, I'm digging this slice-of-life thing until we have to   deal with people confronting Bocchan or something at some point, but we may not   have far to go so besides doing all this Honeymoon stuff haha, we might see   more characters coming in to... hopefully help Bocchan out, I would believe.   Cya guys next week... end haha this is the problem I gotta wait this long   every week I can't even</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ThH57vGQ4c/YPULGvs_deI/AAAAAAABGpI/hP35Fm7uuS4jdeb5HUqJA4hx11oFB-vgACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan03_inside1.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    This looks like business as usual until...   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOenM8EKbFM/YPULHjaXXcI/AAAAAAABGpM/4sRJ1omNe5wnNUOyo9N0G0dKVkTRqXZDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan03_inside2.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    ...you see what is outside the box, in public<br />(haha)   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div>  P.S.
