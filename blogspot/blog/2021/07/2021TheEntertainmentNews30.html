<h2>The Entertainment News 2021 Edition Issue #30</h2>
<div class="news-thumbnail">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e6AVRFLEkks/YP1HBHwvWBI/AAAAAAABG4I/GDlXrpjA8NIafPExWMwZRps1ZaWhH8LRgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano04_rika1.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags"></div>And we're on a Sunday again, which is kind of sad because I thought I have totally left behind what I was thinking about work yesterday and look at Sunday reminding me I have to work again tomorrow lol last week was better haha isn't this every week anyways<div><br /></div><div>  On the upside though, since we do have time to watch half of intended shows   for this week... earlier this week haha if you get what I mean, this will be a   shorter post. What is not a shorter post though, is that package review I've   done a couple of days ago, so be sure to check that out as I simp on Ajuju and   Aki-chan depending on whether you like younger or older women haha ah (If you ask me? Yes)</div><div><br /></div><div>  So, new episodes I guess, let's do this! Oh and also, the almost half a dozen   singles releasing this week that I forgot half of them lol we'll talk about   all of them too<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKano04">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo mo Kanojo</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "You are good people, for a bunch of weirdos in a threesome" O~kay haha   this series in a nutshell btw </div>  </blockquote>  Well in Naoya's defence, he really is treating his relationship with Saki-chan   earnestly without asking about anything in return. Or maybe he doesn't get   women. Who knows. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> In this new episode where we picked up from where   he got Saki-chan angry (#KanoKano04), yeah remember Naoya was like, not   sleeping for three days straight? Yeah, he's dead now. Beat up by Saki-chan. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So, before we   get to the new character introduction, let's talk about some conclusion to   Saki-chan getting furious about... well not giving anything back to Naoya. But   Nagisa is also right: She also wants to give back something to his guy but   then realize for her besides cooking... there isn't much to give back. Okay, her   "good boobs" instead of bad ones lmao but yeah it's not much. And Saki-chan   didn't even have to do anything, which actually sounds great but it looks like a problem the guy   must resolve. So yeah, turns out, Naoya is just carrying all the burden for   happiness to make the girls happy. Well, especially when it's this two-timing   relationship to be honest. And it's the "if you're happy then I'm happy"   philosophy too so go figure. I mean, that sounds great but it's not a relationship   if there isn't a give and take even forced relationships like back in the   ancient Chinese empires with emperor and concubines there is always a give and   take for any number of them or else they will go out of attention of the one   guy. See, Naoya? You gotta learn from historical lessons bro they will teach   you how to deal with your women. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All jokes aside, all Naoya wants in   return is then, in this case for all the girls who love him to... you know, be   happy together. Yes, polygamy isn't exactly perfect, but in this case we are   making it happen until... you know, someone else joins in. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Talking   about that, we will need some background for the new girl as we let Naoya take a nap for a   while since he has been going through this for like three days straight   without sleeping lol. Nagisa and Saki have dinner together and I promise you   no one was physically hurt until Saki-chan decided to actually make friends with this   loner (lol) by playing phone games with her. You know, the only game everyone   is playing that is not already expired years ago because I swear people were   playing the shit out of those 3 years ago when I started working haha.   (Yes, PUBG, if anyone doesn't know) (It's probably relevant when writing the   original manga so) So yeah, I don't know how the Anime got away with super   gratuitous shots of Nagisa dying and even Saki-chan at some point, but   ignoring that we now know Nagisa has another weakness other than math: video games.   Well, let's just say shooting games lest she beats us all in chess or   something lol. But man, not going to post any screenshots on the deaths, so if you   like that stuff... I'm going to call the cops haha. No, I'm going to contact   your local internal security department because you might be a terrorist-   <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, which bring us to Nagisa having to learn how to play these   games from <strike>You</strike> MeTuber Milika, who is a typical example of   modern society using appeal to top the mobile gaming industry just so   they can get an edge into gathering fans and most importantly, donations so   they can continue doing what they like. And in this case, play that gacha thing that   everyone loves and hates lol. (Also, my sis be becoming a Twitch streamer because of free   in-game gems so stay tuned haha) (Audience: WTF) The suspicion of this girl   being a student from their school came from a thumbnail that was later edited,   like some streamers who may have accidentally done that too lol I don't know examples but I   know they exist, which easily revealed that this girl might be a schoolmate,   so as to say. And she is. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, the build-up might be   unnecessary, and we do know the trio's lunch spot will be found out soon   anyways, but yeah since this girl right here wouldn't help keep a secret,   Naoya decided to bribe her with his life savings- Nagisa decided to rat her   online identity out which of course, now makes them even. And don't ask me why   this new girl decided to enforce these secrets by joining in on this   two-timing relationship. Just... don't. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> All in all... how   many -some are we going on this?? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Well you get the idea. They just   didn't bother to make this title longer than the x number of girlfriends (where x is "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/kanojo" target="_blank">Kanojo</a>") in which Naoya is going to get along the way of his high school   life but I'm pretty sure it'll at least end up to be "Kanojo mo Kanojo mo   Kanojo mo Kanojo" by the end of this season. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> (Get it, the main four girls?)</div><div>  [TL:DR; I'm not going to use the word Naoya uses to describe his   relationship(s), but this is going to be a literal f**kfest by the end of this   season lmao sorry guys I'll turn on the rated blog warning haha]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g6DwnhXPdEU/YP1GbAChyeI/AAAAAAABG38/J15kocLG3VM_VjP8enZ3YV8Y5eaNotcxwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano04_hit1.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    This week in violence we have: You know, just Saki-chan hitting on Naoya     lol<br />(We SERIOUSLY cannot show that mobile game footage, no way)   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WHZdkWqpZ3U/YP1GbuNpUYI/AAAAAAABG4A/T1ijMqiwAyYxUT9ysBdkcXuM6C5Giwp7ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano04_hit2.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    This week in violence we have: You know, just Saki-chan hitting on Naoya     lol<br />(We SERIOUSLY cannot show that mobile game footage, no way)   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div>  P.S.

Haha hey, also means this series has been captivating as it is making   me focus so far. As expected for an original; I'm in it. In this new   episode (#SonnyBoy02) we focus a little on a girl with cats called Mizuho, and   another one of the rules on the island: barter and trade. Remember last week   we all jumped out of the illusion that is the darkness in the school to the   actual "world", and as the one dude with Poseidon powers found out through   traversing the waters, there is only this island in this world, with the   school in literal adrift. We'll get back to that in the cliffhanger later, but   suffice it to say this world only has them. Ironic, isn't it? Tell an astronomer that haha. So, to summarize what the science   guy ie. Bill Nye (sorry for the obscure reference I hardly know it anyways) is   saying because I don't remember his name, time as if stops at this point, and   every thing will heal and/or recover after some time including the island they   were in, which also is the essence of them being able to survive this long on   never-ending resources because it just reverts back to when they existed which   effectively spawns more. Video game logic? Think again. Besides that, they   were also trying to figure out a way to escape this world, or this time-space   likely, to go back to an endpoint where this disaster started. Remember again,   this was all likely caused by a lightning strike on the school. Well, or so we   think so far so take that with a pinch of salt. Or an ocean of salt in case   that wasn't enough lol it's just out there man, go swim to it haha. *dabs* Anyways,   Mizuho is using her (not explicitly stated) Nyamazon superpower to order   everything for the rest of the student body, including tents to sleep in, and   things to play with on water. You know, except they just burn in blue flame   but surprisingly not the stuff they brought in from inside the school. I'll   keep the confrontation to the minimum, but because lazy boy Nagara saw her   standing in front of a tree which burnt in blue flame, thought she was   responsible for all this, leading to the students believing as so. Of course,   it was later proven false as Bill Nye here found out this was part of the rules of the world, where anything passed on needs to include a trading condition. (RIP   that dude's glasses as demo haha hey do you want to just burn mine?   <strike>I have a spare lol</strike> I rather not see reality haha *dabs*) Apparently,   "it's a gift" will also count. But not without any mention, is the point.   Which brings us to Mizuho herself. And I kinda of hate this level of school   drama but I guess it's unavoidable, the Student Council was suspected of   rigged elections even before this phenomenon, and then found out that Mizuho   was out there spreading <strike>lies</strike> the truth online. They confronted   her just like how they are blaming her for the blue flames everywhere right   now, but yeah, it all lies on Mizuho not being upfront enough to clarify in her   own defence which, in her conversation with the teacher who told her about the   inevitable of society, probably got defected as a teacher because she was   using Wi-Fi off the library they were in lol. Man, it's scary to have such power especially if you are those from the Student Council. Unethical, even.   But I get it, apologies aren't right in this case as with how Nozomi acts with   complete freedom too which I understand, but despite being quite an introvert   and a shut-in from the student body (represented by her huge castle which she-   how do you order that? lol) she did apologize for escalating this incident by   "ordering money" and "burning the forest" in protest of such a bias, which was   (I never believe I'll use this word here but she is) kinda   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kawaii" target="_blank">kawaii</a> tbh hehe   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/197083/Mizuho" target="_blank">Ao-chan</a>~!! (Haha sorry my inner idolism is leaking) But seriously, if you don't   think this is the most accurate representation of bias and levels in modern   society yet, think again. Anyways, Bill Nye thought of a solution to ensure this   world's rules can still be fulfilled with that barter and trade, and this is a   modern solution by the way though one could just trade leaves for a new surfboard   lol, through digital currencies, with an app apparently because how did you   even make this up here? <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> So yeah, this is quite an episode. We just learnt so much in every episode it's hard to not take it all in, and I kind of enjoy   it to be honest. (Even Yuuki Aoi herself is into it too, as seen from   <a href="https://twitter.com/staff_aoi/status/1418790488862195713?s=20" target="_blank">her retweet</a>) Before we move on, we were hinted with a cliffhanger from Nozomi, who once   again recalls herself seeing an escape point far into the distance, thinking   it was reachable but likely not. But it's there. She can see it. For because   it's her superpower: The ability to escape. Yeah, see where this is going? We   better not offend her now or else we may never leave this place lol yeah right   the Student Council is going to strap her onto a chair and never make her run   again haha or maybe run in circles with a punishment   at least. Man, I am enjoying this series, so I think I might be giving it,   even without more of the spoilers as to what will happen from here on. But   yeah, as you can see, it feels like a game someone is playing on all of them   with superpowers based on their character, from Mizuho loving and creating   stuff to Nozomi wanting to escape the loop of life... each of them has their   edge and hopefully, their counter with all these students here but we are not   that sure about that. Haha heck, maybe Nagara's power will come in use at some   point. I don't know what though I'm too lazy to think about it lol cya guys   next week </div><div>  [TL:DR; Can't you see this is less of a game but more of a learning platform   for these students to grow? Haha ah hey I'm not the producer so don't quote me   on this because   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/198696/Hoshi" target="_blank">some people</a>  are clearly not learning imo]</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D6EHAtoNN1g/YP1HUMOrAJI/AAAAAAABG4Y/Qxo2itL_1vU4rqRxTQHFrYSVjXmnl4HjACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sonnyboy02_mizuho6.jpg" width="320" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Literally me as a kid after I quarrel with my parents haha we've all     been there<br />(Hey, who knew an apology can be this embarrassing haha)   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>  <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BWbgGYvfcK8/YP1HWM60R4I/AAAAAAABG4c/j7YIHaPPG2EvT_3QourYpd4Ll9YFrUqnQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/sonnyboy02_playing.gif" />  </td>    </tr>    <tr>  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Parents watching kids play dangerously in a nutshell<br />(Haha serious     talk though is this&nbsp;<a href="https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/thumb/a/af/Tanooki_Mario_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png/1200px-Tanooki_Mario_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png" target="_blank">a Super Mario reference</a>?)   </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div>  P.S.

Okay I think I need to clarify this for all those millennials who   really have no idea and think "PocketGame" is its name with all the China rip-offs lol, that's called a   "Nintendo Gameboy", and if you have never known what it feels to play with FOUR   AA batteries on a non backlit black and white screen in the late 90s... well I   have. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span>&nbsp; </div><div>  [TIL from Twitter, the QR code on screen when Bill Nye introduced the coin app is real; scan   it for yourself unless you don't have a smartphone like Nozomi and in that   case we'll give you one- YEAH RIGHT haha]<br />  <br /><br />Out of context question though encompassing both shows above: If   Naoya from "KanoKano" was in the "Sonny Boy" world and Nagisa steals him from   Saki-chan without anything in return does Naoya burn in blue flames?

Not representative of everything,   especially after I've reviewed them. So, let's go through all of them. Let's   get this out of the way first, because   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/hello-horizon-single/1575496665?l=en" target="_blank">Minase Inori's new single</a></b>  is quite a disappointment because I gave... nothing which isn't unusual for   her singles I have not given a couple more times basically because she sings   Anime theme songs with sub-par melodies, and we don't take that in Klassic   Note. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Moving on,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B8%E3%82%A2-ep/1573715960?l=en" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's new single</a></b>  is likely the winner this week despite being a likely haphazard production for   a Chinese-adapted Anime because if this is not Eastern enough to make me want   to reject them I'm so glad it sounded good, so I gave more. Sadly, not enough   for a Klassic Note Review because they thought it'll be a good idea to make   this a three-track release&nbsp; so (It's your own composition too? I'm so sorry but) too bad I guess. In comparison though,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%85%88%E9%9B%A8%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8F%E3%81%A1%E3%81%A5%E3%81%91-single/1574131053?l=en" target="_blank">SID's new song</a></b>  which was the opening theme for the same Anime (the former being ending theme)   is real disappointing compared to their previous song so no thanks to that   too.   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/101-%E5%A4%9C%E5%85%89-ep/1573725159?l=en" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single</a></b>  is a meh, but I did give one of the topic songs which is not that new Anime   theme song but it's that... that one which is in part of her self-written   novel series which I probably won't be reading just because.   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-single/1572961600?l=en" target="_blank">GING NANG BOYZ's new single</a></b>  for Anime "Sonny Boy" is fine, and could've been better if they didn't slot a   live audio as their B-side and try to impress me with more Rock music... I   shall not say more the style is real dated too tbh even the theme song itself   is too short to leave an impression. Last but not least, I listened to this aa   week earlier and I forgot too,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AD-ep/1574434277?l=en" target="_blank">ChouCho's new single</a></b>  is actually not too bad, but considering that it's the vocalist herself   writing two songs with the same producer and it ended up sounding totally   different, it's no wonder I rather just give the topic song and move on.   Seriously ChouCho-san, not entirely your fault but you could've told the   producer to not go the electronic music route. <span title="*laughs*">ðŸ˜†</span> Anyways, another miss   for Review. And to give these guys credit, the YouTube ad did get me with   <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1418012291052625920?s=20" target="_blank"><b>indie band Amefuraji's new song</b></a>  and it's digitally available too but problem is... it's less then 2 minutes   long. So welp, looks like I'm not giving anything anyways it isn't as good as   I thought it would be. I would give chance but I barely remembered it so...<br />  <br />  In news concerning music I know of specifically and it's mentioned on Twitter   or I shared because I'm too lazy to find the actual account(s) to Like haha,   <b>Anime "Shinigami Bocchan" revealed full animated music videos</b> of their   <a href="https://twitter.com/bocchan_anime/status/1416753370920935430?s=20" target="_blank">opening</a>  and   <a href="https://twitter.com/bocchan_anime/status/1416753622344298498?s=20" target="_blank">ending</a>  theme songs a week before release so that's impressive can't wait for this to   appear in Apple Music next week,   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV0Po_nXR7k" target="_blank"><b>SID's new music videos</b></a>  are for their newer songs with   <a href="https://twitter.com/visunavi/status/1417680735230595075?s=20" target="_blank">the one I gave</a>  being just a compilation from their recent live which is fine I guess,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1417787183067537408?s=20" target="_blank">Hanazawa Kana's new single preview</a></b>  on her newly created YouTube channel is find I suppose let's hope it's good   two months down the road,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1417836524129775619?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new music video</a></b>  is the song I gave this week see previous paragraph haha, just 10 seconds of   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1418058558738894853?s=20" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new music video</a></b>  is more than enough to be honest I almost died of cuteness overdose watching   her longest YouTube preview yet,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/AKG_information/status/1418123932851339267?s=20" target="_blank">ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's new music video</a></b>  for their new single next month sounds like Gotch's new song lol, and they   also appeared on   <a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1418556503863304193?s=20" target="_blank">THE FIRST TAKE</a>  with one of their classics I gave almost a decade ago... after talking about   three minutes their 25th anniversary happening lol don't ask me why.&nbsp;<br />  <br />  Oh so looks like we only have   <b>Anime "Shinigami Bocchan" theme song single</b> next week?
