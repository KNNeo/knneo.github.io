Haha seriously who is counting that though I just happened to remember that's all <div><br /></div><div>  Well, we are going to go through quite a lot of shows just like last week so   let's get to it then! My Sundays are actually going to compensate for the fact   that my left ear still can't hear too well haha I mean at some point I'll go   to the doctors lol someday </div><div><br /></div><div>  Oh and starting with shows next season, I'm going to refrain from typing   anything I think is great a quote or whatever because I've been doing that for   many seasons for the past couple of years and it's not making of a smooth   viewing experience in my opinion. Let's see how many less jokes I'll be making   from here on haha hey remember just like the story in "OsaMake" I have a   script to follow and analyze lol not anymore I guess </div><div><br /></div><div>  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="HigeHiro13">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">    Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "I'm not going to apologize... because I don't even know when this started   to be a mistake!" Hey mom, we don't know too so what the heck </div>  </blockquote>  I mean, in the mother's defence even I'm tired of this already lol I thought   we were done from last week she can go rest for the day or something. *laughs*   Anyways, in this final episode where we may still never see a happy ending   (#HigeHiro13), I guess we're talking to the mother again after she calmed   down, I guess. But this time, it's Sayu's turn. Man, I thought we were done   last week for real with the mother, but yeah, it's not about that. For   starters, Sayu went down on her knees. For all the years that she has been   around, literally. Probably as a sin or something, but it's also her fault,   isn't it? If she was so good a kid the mother wouldn't even go mad in the   first place. Or maybe she still would. But hey, ever heard of Cinderella?   *laughs*&nbsp; Anyways, the mother doesn't seem to be as mad as she was last   episode so that's already a good start to be honest. And what's more, the   mother actually did the mother thing by you know, not quarrelling with her own   daughter at this point. But it is true though: if it's the dad that is the   a**hole, why then isn't the rest of the family more strongly bonded together?   Right? Hey, I'm not a family relationship consultant or something don't take   my words for it. So yeah, I guess she has to hang out with this mother for   another couple of years to say the least. Actually, if she became a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/rounin" target="_blank">ronin</a> for   another year would be better since if she went back to school she's just only   going to get shit on by the rest of the <strike>class</strike> school anyways   so whatever, she has to tank through all this I guess. Again, they say your   school results don't affect your job portfolio so we shall see about that. And   as Yoshida settles in for the night before heading back because he's not a   Sayu who hangs around under the lamppost lol, the girl sneaks into his room   and the bed in the middle of the night. *silence* Ah hey, no one said this is   over. *laughs* I guess Sayu just came in to (get it?) enjoy her last feel with   (get it?) Yoshida in person maybe and also telling him how bad his life would   become without her haha you don't mind doing chores at his place lol what you   gonna go to his place after you graduate and continue doing that in a year and   a half's time? *laughs* I have a feeling Yoshida won't be hiring you no more   lol ah hey she did change his life, for the better. *giggles* Also, Sayu still   really insists in making memories... through... sex haha so wait, so if I   don't have it with you, you won't remember me for the rest of your life?   *laughs* Sure girl, whatever she probably remembers Yaguchi more than Yoshida   now I guess. *laughs* So yeah, you make no sense, girl, so no, I got bigger   boobs to press *laughs* Okay jokes aside, but you get the idea. It's part of   the talk in this series, I get it, so yeah, thank goodness this is as much as   you get. Or unless you remember that one episode intro where they show her   getting f**ked- Okay let's move on. *laughs* As the family (without the mom of   course) send Yoshida off the next day, Issa wanted to thank Yoshida for   everything, in his own conversation with the guy who literally changed Sayu's   life. He tried to give him some monetary compensation for actually coming here   (Hey Issa, your mom want to pay for the six months rent for Sayu staying at my   place too? Piss off. *laughs*) but Yoshida refused and instead told him to   take the money to effectively give it to Sayu to buy new clothes or   something... (and then it's like, 500k yen or something Sayu's gonna have some   GREAT clothing lol this idiot) man Yoshida is nice till the end, you see.   Really though, Sayu would probably get f**ked by dudes for another half a year   before the brother gets to her and finds out the truth- Hey remember, the   whole family HAS NO IDEA that she was pounded for staying at random dudes'   abodes, by the way. Remember that. *laughs* And finally, Sayu's talk with   Yoshida, the final one for a while. I think the only takeaway I got from this   is I like how Sayu thinks she has a chance when she gets older when by then   she finds Yoshida again he'll be slinging in p*ss and boobs she doesn't even   know. *laughs* Pretty sure that'll happen, whichever one he ends up with that   is not her haha. Well, I get Sayu's persistence on this so I think the best   way Yoshida can prove to her is to end up two-timing maybe Gotou-san with   Mishima- Oh we aren't at the new series "KanoKano" yet? Oops. *laughs* And we   got a small peak on Yoshida being alone after all this, and what fills him up   is probably not love but loneliness, without this girl's presence most likely,   and I bet he will get over it anyways like a true adult. I wonder if the   actual ending in the original novel series is this or not, with Yoshida saying   he's not alright. I wonder. Not that I will be finding the answer, but I think   this is good enough even for an ending. So, all in all, this series has   brought more novel and probably matured ideals about what this story has   initially came about. Yes, probably along the lines of every other series who   want to dump life stories to you, this one does the same but with a more   extreme context, and it's probably as life changing as any one of them out   there. But that's the point, and that's how its appeal came to be, isn't it?   If it wasn't for the banging body of Saya and how Yoshida picked her up, he   probably wouldn't have gotten anyone's interest even in the company,   specifically the two girls who know him. And as we continue to bask on the   story two years after where even Asami gets a piece of Yoshida for some reason   lol... you get the idea haha especially the very end. (Man, so three-timing?   Haha Yoshida living the harem life) But yeah, that is what makes this series   different. I think though, I may have enough of a life lesson taught here, so   I'll be sure to avoid such stories again for a good amount of time unless I   want to cry on my weekends haha I'm already crying on weekdays I don't need   to... *laughs* Totally worth watching though if you're into Sayu or just boobs   in general they offer A LOT in this lmao okay me </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-h9CE4fTUfgQ/YOFNAEe_kMI/AAAAAAABFwg/UlyZYMT4lsMp9tsJDGwI-CTWeJMYLMdOwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro13_yoshida2.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      This series in a nutshell  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jmS2eYFWBN0/YOFNCIUgtfI/AAAAAAABFwk/SMXrD1OocrE1EezlSL2Pg3NMQ8tv6QXDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro13_sayu3.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      This series in a nutshell  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Wow that sounds   like a great idea IF you aren't Sueharu lol yeah thanks Maria-chan </div>  </blockquote>  Okay this is WAY too many panty flashes in one episode lmao what is this   "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1722/Nagasarete_Airantou" target="_blank">Airantou</a>"?? *laughs* Man, they gotta make me do this interjection, huh.   *laughs* In this final episode where we still can afford to screw around just   because (#OsaMake12), they had to ruin this final arc with another conclusion.   *sigh* Okay we'll get to there anyways, so let's talk about everything else   instead. So ignoring whatever maid stupidity lol, it's Kuroha's turn for the   documentary. And I think we can talk about it in the conclusion, so let's just   summarize what Kuroha did to make sure she did an impact with Sueharu's love   life right now even though he technically hasn't landed with anyone yet lol.   Kuroha took him to a cave near the suburbs I assume, where Sueharu spent a   good amount of alone time with Kuroha inside it during middle school (yes just   to confirm no weird things happened there she still doesn't have a rack back then lol)   mainly because as mentioned by the guy himself, his house is too quiet with   the dad busy keeping the family alive without the mother, and the mother...   well you know. And the Shida family is the opposite ie. too noisy, so that is   not making him feel better in any other way, as much as he is putting up a   front from where he learned acting all these years. Problem, I guess. But   yeah, because Kuroha is always the OG childhood friend (I know right?   "OsaKano" is so boring lol more on that later) she is always by his side, no   matter how busy she becomes being the eldest sister of the family and the mother having to work and leaving the house alone. (Sucks to   have to take care of all the younger sisters "They are cute anyways" Yeah true haha but yeah how old are they to talk about this? *laughs*) Ah yes, kid Sueharu, I see that   two people is just enough for this situation. *giggles* Ah hey, and that's how   the childhood friend wins. Okay, the OG childhood friend haha. But you know,   that's where the main part starts. Kuroha admits her mistakes for not making   quick decisions to whatever relationship they were supposed to have progressed   at this point which is nothing romantic to be frank not even close, but that's   where she tried to ask Sueharu again in which, as we have seen from recent   episodes, that'll only keep the guy thinking about the others. So seeing the   failed plan, and yes this is real dumb I know, Kuroha suggested an in-between   relationship which she calls "OsaKano", as in childhood friend-girlfriend kind   of thing, where she can still be like a girlfriend to Sueharu because this   idiot is also coincidentally a harem magnet lol, and still be as nice as a   childhood friend and securing her position all these years- Really, only a   genius will be able to think of this and convince an idiot such as Haru to   accept it. *looks at maid* Haha ah hey what's there to lose for Sueharu   though? He gets to do all the physical on her as if she's a childhood friend maybe girlfriend. Okay not boob touching but still. *laughs* Yeah okay whatever I'll just   live with this childhood girlfriend bullsh*t haha this can only happen in a   harem. *laughs* And to conclude this arc, great we get to remember what this   series love to do best: Get to the results and explain the process without   showing any of it. Great. GREAT. What happened to the lovey-dovey moments of   this series?? *sigh* Ugh. *laughs* So yes, Abe-senpai makes an appearance   again lol whatever I guess we have to pay his voice actor haha, and our actual narrators of this series (lmao) get   to carry the baton and tell us the results of this planned harem proceedings   so far and everyone involved. So in case you didn't realize, yes Tetsuhiko won   but who cares he's not a female lmao, Shirokusa had too great of an advantage   which also means she can't put in dents on the guy anymore haha no really   that's why we talk about the maid lol, Kuroha is trying to gain back   ground after losing so much over the past few arcs, and Maria-chan... let's   just say she's a third option to cry on if ever lmao. And Tetsuhiko made sure to shut   Abe-senpai's mouth so that he can't tell anyone this battle anyways lol. Okay   whatever let's move on. In conclusion for this series though, I think what's   best about it is definitely the harem: it's like the series is so much better   without the entertainment business bullsh*t behind it just like how "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/39017/Kyokou_Suiri" target="_blank">Kyoko  Suiri</a>" is awesome without the mystery behind it lol but just like that series   too, it's the backbone for the story so welp, what can we do about it   apparently people like the showbiz and I hate it and I thought I could get   around IRL dramas with Anime but I guess not so... *sob* Anyways, that's pretty much   it to be honest, everyone still loses though Sueharu is obviously the winner   because he has a fanclub now so MORE girls can get into him lmao I bet you   Tetsuhiko was the founder lol, but in case you didn't notice the irony of   this series... the shock at the end for the three girls means they know they   have been normalized, in the eyes of harem master   <strike><a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11817/Yoshitsugu_Matsuoka" target="_blank">Matsuoka</a></strike>  Maru Sueharu haha. And who gives a shit about the true ending it makes no   sense now to play it now we know the reality already lol. So yeah, as you can   see, there are some great things about this mess of a story, and I'm still   glad I took some time to watch it while resisting the horrid plot that is   basically everything that is not the Sueharu harem parts haha prove me wrong I   was only here for   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank">the</a>  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/19884/Saori_Oonishi" target="_blank">female</a>  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/38659/Kaede_Hondo" target="_blank">cast</a>  anyways MUAHAHAHAHA I'm done with this shitshow </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="1439" data-original-width="1280" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0paJvO6tuh0/YOFOcp3DsYI/AAAAAAABFw8/Xs0sdHn4eUwvyCEKrZ-OWqH5635u6tO5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake12_kuroha1.jpg" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      I know this is a harem but I still think Kuroha's the winner,   always<br />(And I'm not comparing to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11297/Inori_Minase" target="_blank">her voice actress</a> hehe)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z5ZoLnbMEZ8/YOFPu68YeQI/AAAAAAABFxo/SM67gzq2EcIRxD1FuNrRz5hbpdy5dZVvACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/osamake12_pouting.gif" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Seriously Sueharu if you don't want her just a little I'll take   her from you haha<br />(Kawaii~)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

The idea of just betraying or cheating on Sakura Ayane is <i>so satisfying</i> I can't even *laughs* And I'm not that into her too compared to Waki Azumi so go figure lol. In this first episode of... more niche opinions about romance because this is not real life (#KanoKano01), can we just tone this down a bit? Like, for everything?? Geez. *laughs* I'm seriously considering NOT to watch this series for some reason haha yeah because in this series, even the impossible can be considered. But as we all know, it's just a change in dialogue and all goes southward as if north doesn't exist no more. Thanks, weird author who also wrote series like "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34881/Aho_Girl" target="_blank">Aho Girl</a>" which, if you have seen it for yourself, is as weird as it gets. So yeah, no surprise for this series too, to be honest. So firstly, common logic corner for beginners of love, including me because seriously this is all we know is right anyways but you know, there's this Anime. *laughs* So, Naoya the main guy has been successful in getting himself laid at high school with his childhood friend (this is not "<a href="#osamake12">OsaMake</a>" season two btw I know it's very similar but it's not lol) Saki-chan (voiced by <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186041/Saki_Saki" target="_blank">Sakura Ayane</a>- yes this is not "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187166/Shirokusa_Kachi" target="_blank">OsaMake</a>" season two) who finally accepted his confession ever since he started in elementary... school... this is not "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187165/Kuroha_Shida" target="_blank">OsaMake</a>" season two, just a reminder. *laughs* (Yes I did NOT post the same link three times) Anyways, she does casually joke I assume, because they have gotten this far, that he shouldn't betray her or cheat on her in any other way, but this is all about to change lol. On a rooftop after school, a junior came up to Naoya one day and confessed to him, like every other popular guy might have encountered which is not me haha. But before Naoya could reject, this girl Minase (not Inori) straight up asked about his opinion of her just on the surface. And because Minase (ugh) (ok I'll stop haha) has practically trained up to the point of being the most attractive girl in the series so far lol we have only seen two girls, Naoya suddenly came to the conclusion that she is too good to reject!? Yeah, that's a thing. So instead of rejecting the shit out of her after telling her that he has a girlfriend which of course, will cut the line for anyone confessing to a guy because you <strike>know</strike> can assume the obvious, or just saying "let's be friends" because you know sometimes I could be spoiled of your cooking tbh haha ah hey if I'm popular I would like this choice, Naoya chose to... yeah, do two-timing on his current girlfriend Saki. *silence* I can't even- *sigh* (And that's why the author straight up placed a girlfriend test before Naoya can reject her, see where this is coming from?) Yes, so that's where it went wrong. And of course, with Minase working so hard just to get Naoya's attention all this while, instead of going away empty-handed, she will be conciliatory to anything this idiot suggests even if it's sharing the same guy with another girl. Openly. Yeah, this is already awkward, huh. *laughs* Anyways, they thought it'll be a great idea (or he thought) to tell the current girlfriend about it and... thanks Saki-chan for beating his face up haha. Of course Saki-chan suggested all the problems with maintaining such a relationship and the obvious idea of where's your devotion to a romantic relationship anyways and even after all these years this feels like a fever dream, but it's likely because the author served up such a perfect girl even Saki-chan would be jealous of, she did not say no to this affair. Yeah. I phrased that the same way Saki-chan said it: in regret. And this is probably what will happen for the next couple of months going ahead, where instead of just leaving the guy because he can't be faithful as he's too honest about his feelings, she chose to let herself think of the stuff she can do and has not yet did with Naoya considering this is an early relationship, that work-hard Minase will get to the guy first (literally) before she does. In EVERYTHING. Yes, if you wonder why Saki got surprised in the bathroom when Minase said "let's work hard" it's just because she's not going to win at some point... you get the gist of this series now? Man, even the guy is suggesting having a literal&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/3P" target="_blank">t&nbsp; h&nbsp; r&nbsp; e&nbsp; e&nbsp; s&nbsp; o&nbsp; m&nbsp; e</a>    lol please don't flag this site haha. Okay, now for my opinion. Yes, I will still watch this sh*tfest haha because I'm as <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> as Saki-chan in terms of her relationship with a guy who doesn't mind cheating on her lmao. Also yes, I was here initially just so we can watch Saki-chan probably put in some effort to pit against her own rival even if she gets neglected in this polygamy. So as you can see, this will make of a lot of jokes which I will be able to laugh every week considering I don't have someone to two-time on in the first place. *laughs* So yeah, let's see in the end if it's the case where "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/43007/Osananajimi_ga_Zettai_ni_Makenai_Love_Comedy" target="_blank">the childhood friend will never lose</a>" or- Goddammit. *laughs*   </div></div><div style="text-align: left;">  [TL:DR; The word "breakup" is NOT inside the dictionary in this world, just so   you know. *laughs*] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z4aRpuTCU8U/YOF7HzlYtwI/AAAAAAABFxw/0e_vlO7dFz4Gz3rmite9K5V91fvPhpexQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano01_cook.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Serious talk though, do you want this as your girlfriend...  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O0n9hbE_pGQ/YOF7HysvQ_I/AAAAAAABFx0/Nn0UN38yAM4ISHmvYLvKNXfj6OzGl2H7ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano01_dozing.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      ... or this?<br />(Really reminds me of the hierarchy of concubines in ancient China *laughs*)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

I don't want to mention this because this reference is WAY too far tbh,   but the ending animation of girls sending Naoya bikini pics reminds me of   <a href="https://ecs.toranoana.jp/tora/ec/item/040030909692/" target="_blank">this doujin series</a>&nbsp;titled "<a href="https://www.pixiv.net/user/55117629/series/87453" target="_blank">#HereIsTodaysUnderwearReport</a>" (but of course, with underwear instead) (yes, the hashtag is part of the   title too) which I saw online but unlike "Douki-chan" I'm not buying that just   because lol </div><div>  [But seriously though?

So, in this new movie for a series which   I have liked for nearly a decade all thanks to a mistake which I don't recall   lol that's what they say when the girls ask for whoever's responsible for   their pregnancy lmao, I ended up watching this series filled with nothing but   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> jokes   that'll make you tired while still laughing haha. And since I understood this   in major story arcs, I guess we'll talk about them as if I watched three OVAs,   I guess. *laughs* (Well turns out some are from earlier OVAs so wtf) Sit tight; This is going to be long one. Yes, just like a   porno. *laughs* Not "four hours or longer" though, don't worry. They don't   have the budget for that HAHAHAHAHAHAHA they used a costume for this man clearly   they don't have money to animate faces anymore lmao </div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bCfMcLAT2eU/YOGeo81AFgI/AAAAAAABFyM/UZC2QuhGZcI3cn2o_6qZrGvOcuQTZ6X9ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_heights.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    I don't have to tell you who the names belong to and you'll still     get the joke lmao    </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5-ekmoJY8x0/YOGet4_5FTI/AAAAAAABFyQ/N8SMzROF--k88aspTEdlePEAVbjlnyx7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_raising.gif" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Haha Suzu is like that thing which hangs on to carpark gantries?     lol<br />   </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div></div> <div>  Let's start from the top. (Top as in Tsuda is on top of- okay me haha) Okay maybe you   can enjoy the stuck up part with Tsuda and another girl from the Morals   Committee lmao but mainly, the film club starring Tsuda's buddy if you can   remember him, wants to make a film to get awarded. Featuring Tsuda apparently   and... well every girl in school has a chance so COME ON IN!!! *laughs*   Shino-chan is clearly pissed and I don't know why lmao, and if you don't   please go refer to their two seasons of Anime plus dozens of OVAs and I'm not   joking when I say that. Vibration master Nene-chan was the editor for the film   (lol good luck with the publishing haha might I suggest DMM R18 aka FANZA   lmao), Suzu-chan was chosen as main girl apparently probably because she can   memorize lines well haha, the club won some award which is glory to the   school, and I have no idea what the trailer of the movie was about.   *laughs* Surprisingly, new characters were still introduced in this series   which will never die, including since they didn't get bored of insulting short   people they got super tall volleyball club member Hirose who was recruited into the student council   where Uomii is at, and her vice is now doing all her chores because she broke   her right arm probably doing things we shouldn't know of- ANAL. DEFINITELY   ANAL. *laughs* (Audience: Is it okay to not censor that??)

Still, her being along with   Uomii the straight pervert(?) won't get her too clean of her job but she still   has to make the Tsuda siblings lunch for some reason. Yeah, because they be family   family, you know. *giggles* Yeah, Shino-chan is sulking I don't know why.   *laughs* From making Tsuda lunch to asking him out for shopping right in   front of the school gate, that'll be sure to make everyone in the school   jealous. Yes, everyone. In the school. Yes. *laughs* No exceptions. Haha unless   you're as drunk as Yokoshima-sensei on night shift such that your students   have to do the work for you including scaredy cat Suzu-chan who will kill you   for this if she has to, but yeah, all in a day's work I guess. </div><div></div><div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LmGuubcdAig/YOGgHls2qAI/AAAAAAABFzE/y0L6Wp4eHAoIQ9S0xuwX-i_kQjIJEGaQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_lunch1.jpg" width="320" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Shy girls are a rarity in this series in general so here you go<br />(Haha)    </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;"> <img border="0" data-original-height="1507" data-original-width="1280" height="377" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJPFCB_SJk4/YOGgN8g74tI/AAAAAAABFzM/EIGgXBwxq0oeRWQUIoEbncE1P3lY_QPMACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_girls.jpg" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Even in Anime  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/134219/Nozomi_Mori" target="_blank">her voice actress</a>    has a larger rack than others haha ah hey    </td> </tr>  </tbody>    </table>  </div></div> <div>  <div>    <div>  And then, we have some live radio for lunch featuring the student council   because man, Hata-san is sooooo good at doing these things. Besides   leaving the narration out for the last part for surprise surprise, Tsuda   to do the concluding confession scene lol he picked the busty one haha, he   probably also got all the girls in school into it to the extent that he   probably has his own fanclub by now haha. Also good for Hata-san   is coming up with ways to ensure people read their school newspaper   including, since she doesn't have a boyfriend, getting Tsuda to   (coincidentally) join her in couple only locations so she can do some   reviews and make Shino-chan jealous while we're at it. Or probably enjoy   dating Tsuda in the process- Man EVERYONE wants a piece of the action.   *laughs* So, this is self scoop or...? *laughs* Also, this is first   time Ranko-san broke character... isn't it? </div>    <div>  <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">   <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr>     <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9lZLkT02WJw/YOGf9mHLRkI/AAAAAAABFy8/QTq5FAGFy1UcH3yoy-WSAe3ZuAZLLlncwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_hataing.gif" />     </td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Hata-san in a nutshell lmao  </td>   </tr> </tbody>   </table> </div> <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">   <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr>     <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-31LH2aKi4Ag/YOGf_le40VI/AAAAAAABFzA/iOC7EEAJ5YY6MUNsAkSB-NEckYNQywgjACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_hata6.jpg" width="320" />     </td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Hata-san in a nutshell lmao  </td>   </tr> </tbody>   </table> </div>  </div>  <div>    Last but not least, and I'll put two and two together since it's     basically the headline of this movie, it's Shino-chan with the mascot.     Not going to put you in suspense, Sakura-tan is the name of that... dog?     Yeah, that. And the trailers indicate that Tsuda... is no more. We'll     get around to that, but suffice it to say the student council was     thinking about getting the school more personality by introducing a cute     character as a mascot having a  <a href="https://jisho.org/search/sakura" target="_blank">sakura</a>    petal on its head so it fits the Ousai Academy name... and let Tsuda     wear the costume haha. Well we got him again, but also we got Shino-chan     again because since the girls in school like <strike>Tsuda</strike> the     mascot so much... you get the idea. *laughs* And to get their school's     name out there, the girls make Tsuda, uh, I mean, the mascot Sakura-tan     do more errands like go to elementary schools to promote the name... and     it missed the schedule. Yes, please watch until after the credits of     what was that list of Twitter handlers? I forgot haha but yeah. So I     guess it's the "you're as good as dead" story, huh. Now THAT is what I     call clickbait lol or movie bait because I hope they did well in sales     considering the world is on fire right now haha   </div>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail">  <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="2234" height="129" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PILGoVh1VqI/YOGf4LAay-I/AAAAAAABFy0/Gv-S1tPsKIMphtDwZgAuCt_izsUpGJx0wCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h129/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_mascot1.jpg" width="400" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Guess who's under that mascot head haha wrong answers only    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>  <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">   <tbody> <tr>   <td style="text-align: center;">     <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="2229" height="129" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9uF93Ob_jas/YOGf5ndk3YI/AAAAAAABFy4/TcqBNzQEhkYcxvOL7-LOxiHkQ-2Me9BOQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h129/seitokaiyakuindomoG2_mascot2.jpg" width="400" />   </td> </tr> <tr>   <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">    Guess who's under that mascot head haha wrong answers only    </td> </tr>   </tbody> </table>  </div>    </div>    <div>  All in all, I mean, if you aren't tired of the jokes, I am. *laughs*   That's probably why I gave up reading through all the original manga in   the first place haha.

To not   bore you too much and to let you all find out how good they are for   yourself, in summary   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/prologue/1567492837?l=en" target="_blank">Tomita Miyu's 1st album</a></b>  is a meh so I only gave a couple of songs including the album's topic   song,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/maruritoryuga/1568022653?l=en" target="_blank">MaRuRi to Ryuga's 1st album</a></b>  did not really catch my attention even with the album's new songs where   half of them were from previous releases so same fate as Miyu-chan's,   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/fuzzy-knot/1568033187?l=en" target="_blank">fuzzy knot's album</a></b>  isn't all that bad I did like a couple of songs even from when I listened   to their album preview some time ago, and yes   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/caravan/1572625035?l=en" target="_blank">Toyosaki Aki's 4th album</a></b>  is the clear winner but not winner enough to make me do another Klassic   Note Review. Yes, Aki-chan's dry streak might be over but her long streak   for Klassic Note is over haha hey what can I say she should stop sounding   like general pop music or electronic even. We will talk about the list of   smaller releases in the following weeks though starting next week onwards   where releases drop </div>    <div>  <br />On news concerning music and Twitter and I'll try not to create too   many duplicates which are mostly reminding me of livestreams and/or   YouTube premieres about 20 times just within a week lol why,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SonyMusicShop/status/1409759566351458307?s=20" target="_blank">miwa's new single is releasing in August</a></b>  and is for an Anime movie which I have no idea what it's about so we shall   see, I really should've listened to   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/maruritoryuga/status/1409782497693499398?s=20" target="_blank">MaRuRi to Ryuga's album acoustic medley on YouTube</a></b>  first before listening to the album tbh, I did NOT miss   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sphere_PS/status/1409806346199863298?s=20" target="_blank">Toyosaki Aki's album livestream</a></b>  even if I missed just a bit we got to name that camel on her album cover   lmao it's called "Cameron" haha,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/fuzzyknot_staff/status/1409891027607965699?s=20" target="_blank">fuzzy knot's new music video</a></b>  is as weird as it's cool so I'm giving the style anyways, I'll get to   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/pg_koushiki/status/1410616428034543625?s=20" target="_blank">Porno Graffitti vocalist's solo new song</a></b>  someday,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1410252047899758598?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia has a new single releasing in a couple of   weeks</a></b>  in case I didn't know yet lol,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sid_staff/status/1410523572049752065?s=20" target="_blank">SID's new digital single is for Anime</a></b>  and is going to be out in three weeks,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1410327781049659395?s=20" target="_blank">Hanazawa Kana's new single is releasing in September</a></b>  but surprise surprise   <a href="https://twitter.com/hanazawa_staff/status/1410327278320381953?s=20" target="_blank">under a new music label specifically PONY CANYON</a>  which is same as Taketatsu Ayana and Kitou Akari FYI (so maybe sell some   bromides?? *giggles*),   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1410946360413626368?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora is the first voice actor appearing in THE FIRST TAKE</a></b>  as a solo artist and if you have no idea what that is go Google it   yourself,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/aniplex_event/status/1411338952326397952?s=20" target="_blank">Aniplex Online Fest is a (free) thing on YouTube with English   subtitles</a></b>  and music performances by ClariS and Aimer and LiSA which you should take   a listen before it's gone,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1411524384766889985?s=20" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new single releases in August</a></b>  which includes all the digital singles so far so I guess I'll wait till   then, and   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/natalie_mu/status/1411293689767284736?s=20" target="_blank">Kuso Iinkai is releasing a new album in December this year</a></b>  in case you forgot about them they announced their return quite some time   ago so let's see if they can catch up to the times and to me. What am I   hyped about? Probably Kana-chan's move out of her previous music label   Aniplex likely for the China expansion because if you peeked at the   tracklist there are a lot of songs but basically not including   instrumentals it's half Japanese and, wait for it, half Chinese. Yes. Ugh   I can't even- Oh I'm ONLY giving the Japanese songs by the way so   Kana-chan? Your future releases will now really NEVER be able to be   reviewed by me unless I give the Chinese versions so too bad, I guess.   MUAHAHAHAHA lol<br />  <br />  So next week, finally things died down so we only have   <b>The Floor's new mini-album</b> which I've waited for quite a while so I   hope it's good but going from the preview video I may have some holding   back to do to be honest haha, so if that falls apart I'll go on and give a   couple of <b>VTubers new songs</b> including   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/bluerose-comet-ep/1573858346?l=en" target="_blank">Hoshimachi Suisei</a>  and   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E5%A4%AA%E9%99%BD%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3-single/1574601955?l=en" target="_blank">Oozora Subaru</a>  with the latter as her very first original song apparently and I could use   a summer songs that sounds like Tomatsu Haruka so why not lol, and some of   <b>the other mainstream digital singles</b>&nbsp;we have missed so far   like (not going to link all of them) Cocoro Auction, LuckLife, THE ORAL   CIGARETTES, Horie Yui- What did I just say about missing new digital   singles THESE GUYS HAVE GOT TO STOP lol relax me<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Man, I've been writing super long weekly blog posts lately, huh. Don't   worry, it'll only get longer when we start watching more Anime next week   haha if all goes well I will have to watch FOUR shows within this season   which I hope not I'll see if removing one of them is even possible though   haha I doubt so tbh. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... let's   just say I barely had time to take naps AND I still haven't scanned the   previous batch of bromides ever since I did the post last week haha yeah I   was that tired lol also I should really stop eating whatever pills I have   now and go see the doctor before I really drop dead haha let's see if I   can live on these till next week lol bye </div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. I think ever since I heard of VTuber Himemori Luna's practice sessions with her <a href="https://jisho.org/search/electone" target="_blank">electone</a> ie. electronic organ (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2BTE5xun_0" target="_blank">here's today's practice video</a>, likely unarchived) yesterday night and I think her female appeal (as a baby lol she's growing up) is getting into me I'm starting to like her somehow haha hey after all the chaos that is the one dragon I could use some classical mellow music of famous Anime soundtracks I don't know of lol</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. In case you doubt her skills an electone consists of two sets of keyboards of smaller range than a piano and foot pedals as bass with settable timed beats which can be customizable to drum beats for example depending on the model. I know of all of this because I have played that for some time before as a kid and know how hard playing anything on that is</div>  </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
