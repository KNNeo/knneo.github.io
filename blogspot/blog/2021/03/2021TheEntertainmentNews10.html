Oh hey, Ede-chan, happy birthday yesterday by   the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You are already 25 can we have a photobook please? I just lifted   the ban on buying and reviewing photobooks recently so... <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> *prays* </div><div><br /></div><div>  Anyways, not talking about myself personally, I hope you have seen the work   I've done over the weekend ie. mainly those packages for my birthday have   arrived. If you need a summary RumiRumi won Valentine's Day lol I know right   why bother pitting Ajuju against Aoi-chan I don't even understand </div><div><br /></div><div>  Not talking about any of them, let's Anime! I can't really talk a lot about   music but I can for Anime. It's the time of the season where they dosh out   announcements for the next season line-up, by the way.&nbsp;<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogsWan08">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I've never had flu since the day I was born" Yes, lucky you Akutagawa,       not everyone has to suffer through this week unlike you lol     </div>  </blockquote>  The best part about Akutagwa falling sick is, you know, Dazai gets to   visit. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, man, I wish my crush would come to visit me when I'm sick   lol I'm only sick in the mind haha. Anyways, in this new episode   (#BungouStrayDogs08) when you have problems with Dazai coming to see you lol,   Akutagawa has a fever. Not like a fever over Dazai or Higuchi if that is ever   a thing lol, but you know, in general. Like when your forehead gets too hot,   kind of fever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And yep, in the dumbest fashion ever, instead of like,   giving him like Paracetamol which I hear is the <i>typical</i> method in which   to bring down a fever and most headaches (ugh too much experience, me),   Higuchi went to buy him yoghurt drink. Yeah, just because he said the curry last   night f**ked his stomach up. I don't think that's a proper remedy or maybe I   should go do some research on it but (haha), so yeah go see a doctor. Who   knows? Maybe you too have also contracted one of the most fast-spreading   diseases in the world right now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, when you mistake a racoon   for a dog. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, this pace of the series is strong, I tell ya. So   yeah, it's literal joke fest when it's just Dazai standing in the middle of   nowhere, shouting at a dog to come out when it's just like, Poe's raccoon?   Yep, I remember that dude. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And noticing Atsushi maybe because the way   he phrased it, it might not be the case because we can actually believe   Dazai's an idiot lol, and also you know, so we can make Akutagawa believe Dazai is ignoring him. Man, the layers upon layers of whatever I can't even.   Ranpo-san only sees a lot of them marching towards the Agency lmao. Last but   not least, and this is my favourite this episode or even the series already,   It's Port Mafia' First Body Double Competition!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, to be   specific, the rules are (lol) the body double is to cover for their leader   Mori Ougai for a shady trade deal, contestants are everyone in Port Mafia who   has been casted thus far so whoever whoever appeared in season two I'm sorry   lol, and it's whoever can capture his... man, count that   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shoujoai" target="_blank">shoujo-ai</a>  thing in too because if you don't sound like a pervert I'm sure the enemy will   find you out. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, for the results: Chuuya was disqualified just   because he's waaaaay lower than the average height lmao must be the gravity   powers (lol), Tachihara doesn't look half bad but he could remove that band-aid,   Higuchi is for those female fans out there also perfect rendition of the   lolicon aspect missing in Tachihara lmao, the lemon bomb dude also   participated in case you didn't notice him for like 3 seconds in the video   haha, Akutagawa might be the perfect double disguise until he opens his damn   mouth lol Gin too but probably without the mask (hehe), and Hirotsu wins as   Mori Ougai. No, as in, he wins because he can do it better than the original   lol Mori just ended up going to the location as himself haha man did he lose so   bad here. All in all, how to say, this is the level of comedy I expected   walking in when I was watching season one back in 2016. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, never   too late, I suppose. Man, we're not even close to the end. Can we have a   competition now but in the Agency? I can't wait to see like, Naomi dressed as   the President lmao haha cya next week   <div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2rQ8J4Yg0pM/YETh9fU3XII/AAAAAAABC7g/is_gxQUVpE40jlnEhMhrElu-xnQsrJ6OgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan08_mafia.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  We know who's in this meeting just to listen lol                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yc1YuQ-KzqA/YETh9cshrVI/AAAAAAABC7c/cUmFvhpktHY1ggwsN5jxwL0QpIIAQqN6wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan08_akutagawa6.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Yoghurt drink companies, I have your next mascot lmao                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

In this new episode (#Horimiya09) we       got more "friends" to talk about. Not talking about the ending, but more       like Miyamura's... well the people around him who have been... observing       him? I mean, what does bullying count as? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And Miyamura might be       right: There aren't any friends you can make. Eventually. Yeah. Just, you       know, I don't want to. <span title="*dabs*">😎</span> Anyways, story. Firstly, and I think this is       Hori-san's fault in essence, is when she think's it's cool to hairdresser       his boyfriend up in school. And then she gets jealous of all the girls on       him. I mean, you asked for it, b*tch. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> She likes that stuff? Sure.       <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Sadly, Miyamura isn't all about that but we'll get to that later       in case some female audience here is also keen on it lol, the couple       chanced upon his... "schoolmates" let's call them that, in middle school.       As we have learnt so far he's only getting bullied for being such a loner       in middle school, these guys got straight into insulting him and his...       probably not girlfriend with him. You don't want to know their fate lmao.       But yeah, essentially he got the best deal out there in town: have a       masochist girlfriend who can also beat shit out of people. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man,       if you ask me what my girlfriend ideals are, here you go Hori is literally       it haha. How to say, Miyamura, "those two were great stress relievers".       <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Right timing too, don't even have to think of something to       appease your jealous girlfriend now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, joke's over, moving       on.&nbsp; And of course Miyamura feels weird doing the sadist stuff, so he       has to ask the father... who probably knows lesser. See, Miyamura, if       the daughter bullies the dad you step in with your powers to teach her some       respect, man. You see the cycle now? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But as we all have learnt so       far of Hori from Ishikawa and Miyamura who actually know her more than       everyone else, Hori may be popular but dating this time bomb would require       a lot more than just being nice. No really, it's true. Next up, we got       Mizuochi? I don't know, it's another random guy in class who probably       looked down on him. You see... once you have a girlfriend you social       circle starts expanding. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No experience on that though, don't       quote me on that. For witnessing Miyamura being an idiot about finding his       phone until he dropped it knowing it's on his parson all along lol wtf, so       him telling on Mizuochi how to date Hori-san... man, is this friendship       thing really weird in these cases, but probably more true than ever. The       masochist stuff... I hope that is not an IRL thing lol because I would       LOVE to meet one. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, Tanihara and his conscience waking up       probably after getting beat into a pulp by Hori I guess. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Yes,       it's another snippet from Miyamura's childhood, and apparently it's about       rabbits. To sum it up because the situation in the locker sure is weird to       understand, kids were off on summer vacation and Tanihara was supposed to       feed them but didn't, and he shot the blame right at the poor loner dude.       So yeah, what an asshole, this piece of shit- Oh Hori, you alright?       <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But yeah, there are such things in school probably, not really       the guy who will blame or have taken such blame before, but maybe, just       maybe, it'll hurt if you don't move on. Again, Tanihara is the one feeling       remorse of the rabbits dying because Miyamura ain't no killed any rabbits,       yo. Who's the sinner now? So yeah, use your kid brain once in a while,       yes? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Is this how I should review this? lol okay. And in the       weirdest fashion ever, Tanihara tried to contact Miyamura. Yes, and still blamed him for everything even if he did not pick up the phone this shit can still       believe he was ignored. He doesn't have your phone man how would he know.       <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Oh well, part of growing up anyways. All in all, I feel... most not       relatable, but sentimental looking back at this episode. How to socialise       with another dude who likes your girl, people feeling bad after bullying       you but loves the act of bullying I don't even know, your masochist       girlfriend... <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> It's all in the day of school, man. Mine isn't as       exciting but I'm glad Miyamura is living his life outside instead of       inside, if you get that part of the episode.     </div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8zTP_Tq9xMQ/YETi84MoPCI/AAAAAAABC8A/jfhxWHfJXJIoBGtgA5_rFiYy8NUhnVY7ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya09_slap1.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This Week on violence we have:<br />Okay all is normal now                   haha<br />(Doesn't stop the opposite from happening though                   Hori likes that shit)                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Fod9_c-ixI/YETi80vVsAI/AAAAAAABC78/_5raebB2SEUwT_BzXg58meI9CPwbtZXpACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya09_lowson.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Couldn't be more elaborate, in case you don't know of Japanese                   convenience store chain LAWSON                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

Hey, prophets aren't everywhere but this guy       is a good one. In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan72) we, uh, wow this is       pretty f**ked up right now, I'll say it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man, the plot twists       here are real. So, in the first episode of Eren's return into power to       control the situation, we have learnt a lot of things about not war. Okay,       should we talk about those first? Gabi and Falco? Yeah, let's do that       first. So firstly, about Gabi and Falco's trip to an awesome lunch they       will never forget. But of course, there's also another purpose for their       visit with the family of Marleyeans: Kaya has noted to them on Nicolo who       works on this restaurant who is also a Marley soldier, so maybe he can       help them. Spoiler alert: He can't already. Well, mainly because he       doesn't have any contact with the actual army already, so you should have       guessed. Still, the kids go into his abode, have a great time eating, and       Falco had to fake a stomach ache. So the two followed Nicolo into the       cellar to ask him about... how to get them out. Sadly, they also had to       reveal their identities as soldiers... who escaped Marley through an       airship and killed some Eldians... which, uh, as usual, Falco's the one       who saw it in case you forgot the context just like I did: Gabi killed       Sasha, the one Nicolo likes, the one who loves his cooking, and who was       visited by him on her grave which is also how they got this meal. Yep. Gabi totally deserved that hit, but       again nice guy Falco strikes again- Why are all the good guys always       covering for the dumb evil people? Haha I don't know. But man, is this       already quite a climax, probably the best so far as remember last few       weeks where we were killing people by the crowds with Titans? Now, it's       even just killing the one kid that'll cause problems. They gone through a       lot of talking which I think is necessary in showing how much Sasha means       to everyone (RIP), maybe also Falco a bit (RIP) but yeah, the Scouts who       visited also witnessed this whole thing. Man, isn't it hard to do war?       Hey, not to the top in command who have the decision to end lives in their hands. They just have accidentally tainted hands even though they did not kill no one. ANYWAYS,       moving on, we'll talk about how fast Eren is up with his plan to maybe       reunite with Zeke. I would say Zeke knew everything&nbsp; up till now even       with Levi's soldier and his tip about what happened outside of the camp       they were in. Because in case you didn't notice, unless I don't think Levi       drinks and it probably wouldn't matter anyways, the wine they drank was       drugged with Zeke's spinal fluid, and as seen in the intro, it kind of       paralyzes the other Eldians. But since the dosage isn't that high, good       chances they are meant for something else. Remember Zeke was screaming and       Titans appeared? Yep. Haha yep. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Levi probably knows he's all       alone in camp now without much supplies left, so good chances he'll be       leaving sometime soon if he's still smart enough. Then, Eren springs into       action at the restaurant. So firstly, as the guys were busy saving Falco,       Floch and some guys came in with guns (yep guns are a thing now), just as       Nicolo was talking about the wine. Surprisingly, Floch knew of this       already, which also means... Yelena you piece of shit. Yeah, as you can       see, the conspiracies here stretched long and far, for the people who have       decided to support Eren from under the bushes as of like, last week to be       honest. Then, Eren appears in front of Mikasa and Armin with his palm       slit, perhaps ready to screw with any Titan form earlier than Armin maybe.       Oh and Gabi, let's not forget that. And it's probably why Gabi isn't the       one killed, for she has to witness all this. All of how serious this has       already become, in the hands of the enemies. Man, all in all, I know I       haven't described enough in detail, but man it was quite an episode. I       have too much to absorb I don't even know what I can say. It's actually       all according to plan. Well, just so far, we don't know who's the bad guy lol. From Zeke to Eren and his small army to the HQ to Levi's squad       and everyone in between, it is already a confusing situation even within       this island. I guess that's what it means to war. Deception and       conspiracies, just like how Yelena and Eren liked it. *evil laughs* Man, I       have a feeling this will end quite spectacularly, not because my friend is       tipping me off about the ending in the manga which is probably over by       now, so I would like to see this end, whichever direction it goes. Will       Eren take over the place after getting into Zeke's mind and then betraying       the heck of out of him? Will more people inside the island be under the       impression that there aren't traitors among them? We haven't even fished       out the current military from HQ and in the squads around now, man, you       tell me. Okay cya guys next week for more mystery because I can't wrap       myself around this to be honest&nbsp;     </div>    <div>      [<strike>Yes yes MVP Kaya-san now leave me alone haha</strike> *sees Kaya       try to kill Gabi* okay nvm lol]     </div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jhPF04JzqVM/YEYsDNSBG7I/AAAAAAABC90/nUlP0fMxbBQEu520-5a8KPa5mQ0OtFvpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan72_kaya1.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This episode is too depressing (surprise surprise) so let's                   show cute stuff instead<br />(Haha kawaii)                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yxjvMcDIEjw/YEYsDrTPKII/AAAAAAABC94/CYTNvPnthR4DjOR2LkFyIpRghWWUB4kawCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan72_gabi.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This episode is too depressing (surprise surprise) so let's                   show cute stuff instead<br />(Man, you look kinda cute you if                   you don't talk, Gabi. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>)                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

"That is why it's up to us to shoulder the sins of the past" Let       that sink into you for a bit.<br />      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>          <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>        </div>      </blockquote>      So yeah, not much this week considering I still managed to listen to       <b>SCANDAL's new single</b> and yes it'll come with Marinka's single from       last week now and I can still do all this in my... half impaired state lol       not really I did kind of recover and go to work for a couple of days just       to "show face", you know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, didn't do much besides that. I       know SCANDAL is preparing for their 15th anniversary, so I'll support them       single-track releases as long as I can buy them, just like with Chatmonchy       in 2012. <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Oh yeah, gotta consolidate the packages... Done haha<br />      <br />For news considering Twitter and let's see how much of them are       music-related lol,       <b>Hanazawa Kana is back with a digital single</b> (credited for China       collab ugh) and also best thing ever       <b>her music library is going to be on subscription services</b> YES haha,       it might be over by the time you see this but       <b>yanaginagi's birthday live on YouTube</b> is not bad, I'll probably       listen to <b>Anime "Horimiya" character songs</b> when I can, TrySail       announced quite a bit in their recent live including       <b>TrySail's new single in June</b> and       <b>Amamiya Sora's new single in May</b> both for Anime,       <b>SHE's YouTube video for blackboard</b> which is probably just a channel       for music isn't that bad it's the new song, and       <b>wacci release two new songs and music videos</b> which I didn't even       notice until like, my Google feed told me. It's not exactly awesome so       I'll wait for their next major release. I'm like that, by the way, unlike       people who jump in to new songs just because they support the artists and       of course this is a better way to create engagement as a way for metrics       in Capitalism in case you wonder. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Why do I know so much lol     </div>    <div>      <br />      So for next week, I'll probably be diving into new singer-songwriter       <b>Kamiyama You's new single</b> (that is read as "yo") for Anime       "Horimiya". Man, the following week is going to be great, Friends' new       single and Middle Kids album? I better be well to listen to both of them       haha<br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      <br />      Okay I'm done. I'm tired, I sneezed a lot of phlegm in the shower just now       which will probably let me survive the night, so let's see if I need to       get more MC tomorrow to save this... hopeless body you know how much I       want to jerk off already?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, me. I have quite a headache now       unlike when I was doing reviews for the Anime earlier today so I wonder       why. Cya guys next time then, and until then... don't point out my       spelling mistakes because I saw them from last week's issue and I see a       lot I just don't have the time and/or energy to go through them I need to       rest, okay? So, until next time, people. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Well, bye.<br />    </div>  </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
