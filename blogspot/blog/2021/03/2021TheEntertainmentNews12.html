Oh yeah, I forgot to update last   week's, but "Attack on Titan" met a TV simulcast in Japan issue when an   earthquake affected airing on some stations, so they postponed it to this   week, so two episodes back to back. Yes, and that also affects worldwide   distribution. Industry first incident? Well, first time I saw it though tbh<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogsWan10">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "YOU'RE going to make the (<a href="https://jisho.org/search/oden" target="_blank">oden</a>), Dazai-san?" Haha Atsushi with the danger alert from his brain "I'll       call on Yosano-sensei" lmao     </div>  </blockquote>  <div>    Man, even the President is trying to defend Ranpo-san's honour but     seriously, it's hard he behaves like a kid lmao. In this new episode     (#BungouStrayDogs10) where since they talked about barbeque recently and     they can't reuse material we are having hotpot instead, I guess. So, let's     talk more story, and does it feel like it's already ending soon? How the     time has passed on this short series, isn't it? Firstly, the hotpot. If you     have seen the eyecatch on the formula for Dazai to make hotpot, you (1) get     Atsushi to buy the ingredients as usual and (2) ask Kunikida to cook.     *laughs* See? It's that easy lol. Well, for one, I don't think anyone wants     to have a taste of Dazai's cooking even if it's just dumping stuff into a     pool of soup base, but hey, what do I know about cooking haha. And good     chances the hotpot had to be made multiple times so it won't accidentally     get cleared by Naomi who thought it'll be a good idea to give it to her     brother... and you know, feed him in the process F**K YOU TANIZAKI haha oh     well I don't have an     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> what do     I know about happiness/sadness lol. Yosano and Ranpo are jerks for     destroying the food meant for them to eat especially with Kunikida doing     everything, and Kyouka-chan is me if I'm not picky lmao. Dazai is obviously     not eating because you can barely see him in on camera because he's so big     after taste-testing lol. Then, it's everyone going to watch the one movie.     You know, the one Chuuya has been wanting to watch for a while, one with     cute doggos but he thinks it's weird for him to watch it. I mean, it will be     weird if     <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/196/Kishou_Taniyama" target="_blank">his voice actor</a>    went to watch it lol. But as he took the lift Atsushi accidentally ended up     in the same lift/elevator with him, so, uh... well it's not Dazai/Chuuya or     Akutagawa/Atsushi combinations so we shouldn't have to worry too much lol.     Anyways, there was quite a blackout, Atsushi thought Chuuya is screwing with     him using the lift, and when power was restored the movie was cancelled. So     yeah, don't ask Dazai to go watch a movie with Chuuya, please, Atsushi.     *laughs* Then, it might be two months too early, but summer. And summer     means yukata, fireworks, and Dazai's departure...? Hmm, somehow that seems     like an offset to the actual drama which might be used to conclude this     season, but who knows? They may have taken this too seriously though lol I     mean look at the ending sequence. All in all, if you want more wholesome     content from this series this is as much as you will get to be honest, and     we know the cow is MVP lol it's in the gatherings I can't even</div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAh5zMdUkbg/YFc7Li-2Z4I/AAAAAAABDOg/M9VUXAjrfHcbq_oSChSnRRh-Gk_mOYCDACLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/straydogswan10_escape.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAh5zMdUkbg/YFc7Li-2Z4I/AAAAAAABDOg/M9VUXAjrfHcbq_oSChSnRRh-Gk_mOYCDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan10_escape.jpg" width="320" /></a>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">          These will unlikely happen if not for this spinoff series so here you           go         </td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">    <tbody>      <tr>        <td style="text-align: center;">          <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t3HBYkdguzc/YFc7MTu_QUI/AAAAAAABDOk/qB0ScoUdWrAOQJ6nbTRoU4eJgLrDGe-eQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/straydogswan10_atsushi6.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t3HBYkdguzc/YFc7MTu_QUI/AAAAAAABDOk/qB0ScoUdWrAOQJ6nbTRoU4eJgLrDGe-eQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan10_atsushi6.jpg" width="320" /></a>        </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">          These will unlikely happen if not for this spinoff series so here you           go<br />(<a href="https://jisho.org/search/eroi" target="_blank">eroi</a>)         </td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></div>  </div>  P.S.

Oh really? Gotta use that as the new benchmark now lol</div>    </blockquote>    So who the f**k is Shuu? *laughs* I guess we will find out in this new     episode (#Horimiya11) because they be talking about siblings- By the way I     have an     <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oneesan" target="_blank">onee-san</a>. I     don't call her that because I'm not Japanese but you know how much I want a     younger sister already so... Haha let's move on. So, firstly, sausage fest     if you would like to call it. *laughs* Okay don't look up on it I'm worried     about the ratings now lol. (Yeah if there is any) We are introduced to more     characters? Man, we're near the end though lol. Cue most extroverted (in     school) character... let's call him Iura (Shuu, is his name), though windbag     might be a better term lmao. Okay, about this guy, he's kinda annoying, he's     loud, he doesn't care about others... unless we be talking about his younger     sister but we'll cover that in a while, but hey, with all the guys hanging     out and Hori leaving and Sawada being uncomfortable you would have wondered.     *laughs* All in all, just playing around with friendships, I guess, and it's     great to see how all the classmates are hanging out nicely, unlike...     mine...? I don't know look at my Facebook feed. *sees all marriage     announcements* Okay f**k me then. *laughs* It was fun to watch all the     hijinks at least, and yes Honoka is cute I'll keep saying that until they     can come up with the new girl. Okay, Iura's imouto Motoko-chan is also kinda     cute, and she might be our focus in a moment. But between Honoka liking Iura     so long as he keeps his mouth shut (lol) as evidenced by him helping her     out, to like, Iura being a brother to his sibling... he's all sorts of     things put together in his image to everyone, I guess. I mean, the imouto     just described him as an introvert... like... her haha nice joke     Motoko-chan. *laughs* And I guess, as that is a more heavy topic anyways and     as if episodes of Miyamura being emo about his past isn't bad enough, let's     talk about Motoko's future. She got mocked by the teacher got opting for a     better school which may or may not accept her, and thank goodness the     brother chose to help her by assisting her with Hori-san the ace student,     and hopefully by then, we can have the one attempt at chasing our dreams.     Hey, lucky you Motoko-chan I don't have such connections to get me into a     good school you should thank your brother. *laughs* All in all, unless you     want me to talk about the hijinks specifically, I'm still technically crying     over Sakura's rejection last episode lol, and yeah, just be the brocon that     you might be Motoko-chan and join your bro in the same school. *giggles*     That'll get Honoka jealous lmao haha what (Then again not possible because 3     years apart and high school is 3 years)   </div>  <div>    [TL:DR; If you like cute girls in this series this episode is it hehe wait     Motoko is     <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/72467/Motoko_Iura" target="_blank">Kanemoto Hisako</a>?

Hey, Alternative music is rough, okay? I like it but     it's also not easy to accept imo<br />    <br />On news concerning Twitter and music of which I care about because I     need to spend time reading my timeline every day,     <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b> is a meh but you can watch the music     video to get something to get hooked on lol,     <b>Sangatsu no Phantasia's new video</b> on YouTube is from a recent live so     if&nbsp; you like some Mia-san (who still wouldn't show her face on camera)     you're welcome, <b>Takahashi Rie's new song</b> got credited for an upcoming     drama which is kinda cool for any voice actor's music debut tbh,     <b>LuckLife is releasing a new digital single</b> in April,     <b>SHE's released a new live video</b> on YouTube featuring their new song     they are getting a lot of publicity here, and last but not least     <b>RYTHEM announced a livestream</b> upcoming May after nearly a decade from     disbandment back from their album in 2010. yucat-san and Niitsu Yui-san,     tell me what will happen, yes? I'm rather excited but I don't think it's     that but maybe they will be coming back after all, I don't know. We could     use some of them to pad this year's songs though tbh but maybe it's also     just a reunion stream how would I know haha<br />    <br />    Looks like I get to take a break next week, but from the looks of it there     are new releases from many artists I know of according to Skream, so let's     see if <b>YUKI's new single</b>, <b>FINLANDS' new album</b>, and     <b>Base Ball Bear's new single</b> will make next week a little different.     We have heard of Base Ball Bear earlier this year so maybe that's a     start.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Okay I'm done. I'm coughing way more than I have to so I better wrap up and     go sleep early in case I have to spend more time coughing than sleeping     throughout the night lol. Cya guys next time then, and until then... Really,     when here is more interesting than my life right now... Haha okay bye I     prefer not to think too much all is well in everyday life isn't it?<br />  </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.S.
