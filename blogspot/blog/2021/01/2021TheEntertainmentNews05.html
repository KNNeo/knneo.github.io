And I'm not even prepared to pay for <i>everything</i> that's coming out next month haha my birthday package is going to be such a good time you don't even know hehe<br /><br />Also, what a great time to do drilling in a Sunday afternoon, huh, when I want to watch Anime. *scolds vulgarities to upstairs* Anyways, it was a week passing by once again, and man, is work boring so let's talk more about Anime instead! And also, music. Oh also, my upcoming package which I'm still in the process of thinking because what better way to burn your workload than to spend more money on married women haha I meant Ayachi we'll talk about them later but first...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogsWan03">  <div style="text-align: center;">    <span       class="head-prefix"       ><b>アニメ</b></span     ><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span>  </div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">  <div style="text-align: center;">    "Just what is Yosano-sensei going to do with (those meat)?" Oh Kunikida, you     don't even know haha   </div></blockquote>If you will even trust anyone, literally ANYONE who said they don't lie, you sheeple you need to be awoke right now watch this series so you can learn to not be deceived by <strike>people like</strike> Dazai haha. In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs03) we have more dumb shit happening, in case you wonder what this series was about again lol. No really, Akutagawa releasing whatever that thing is in Episode 1 is literally the only action you'll see in this series EVER haha. Okay, maybe Super Deduction from the Chairman but you won't need an Ability for that one incident like Ranpo. Firstly, about running errands. Yosano-sensei is a busy woman, between ripping people apart and putting them back together... haha I don't really want to know more, but you know, she gotta do some supply runs once in a while. Ranpo decided to be the nice guy (which he never does anyways so you gotta wonder) and said to... help out by asking someone else to help her. Okay bro, whatever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But for finding Kenji who had a bad memory much like I did, the words got mixed on accident (unlike with Dazai, we'll get to that in a bit) when telling Kunikida about his plight because he got something else to do, and thus, forgot that he has to do that instead of making a promise to help Ranpo in the first place. You with me so far? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, Kunikida being the hardworking guy, asked the lazy guy Dazai to help which of course would be worse than asking the whole of Port Mafia to help lol, then asked Atsushi to buy... for simplification because this one was intentional, a whole cow instead of meat parts which is also not even close to what Yosano wanted so... guess they have a cow now lol hey they can get some milk every day haha. Talking about milk, we got a cat to take care of, courtesy of Kyouko-chan finding one on the streets. As it was seen with a collar, it's likely a lost cat then a wild one, so obligation to keep it alive is a lot higher considering we gotta find the owner, but also, the obligation of getting attached to it as time passes... not that we should be too attached to it though Kyouka but hey you can still take care of it while it's around like how well Kunikida did with that first serving of milk, and unlike the Chairman who just... can't resist the cat so he's just avoiding it? Okay sir, whatever. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Somehow, also the most appearances we might see the Chairman this episode to be honest, because next up, we gotta talk a little about him and his work. You know, being the middleman between Ability users and normal humans is a tough business. Fortunately, newly self-hired to be assistant Ranpo is here to help. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, no one said that was a good thing haha. From eating up his serving of <a href="https://jisho.org/search/daifuku" target="_blank">daikufu</a> so freaking blatantly ie. a moment before he stepped into the room holding the tray lol, to replying his letters which are honestly so straightforward it's right, to changing his phone ringtone... I think he only did the last thing right haha. No really, that's it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> More jokes incoming, I guess and as I would say for any comedy series, if this even made you giggle a bit, you can watch this till the end. Coming in from an action series I've liked over the past few years and honestly the only one I've picked up in recent years, this is still entertaining to watch Chibi Kyouka is kawaii haha the cat may have stolen the light from her for a moment but <div>  <div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FlUXSiwTobE/YBZdWo1603I/AAAAAAABBh4/qOWyfmfugfwYkYeu9962B6m0FT4ZoHzFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan03_cat2.jpg"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Kyouka-chan can you stop being cuter than a cat? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                     border="0"                     data-original-height="720"                     data-original-width="1280"                     src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CPxACWXgZLo/YBZdWklTZJI/AAAAAAABBh8/mTLD9Xrw5yk-kHaDZCmOB9HR2f7p-FhoACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan03_eyecatch.jpg"                     width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This episode in a nutshell haha                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

Also memo             memo haha           </div>        </blockquote>        From the "I can't have melon" part from Ishikawa to both of them         stopping Sengoku, this might be the most relaxed romance Anime series in         history. Seriously, guys, where's the drop? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode         (#Horimiya04) of "Sengoku's Harem"... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> no we're not going to         talk about that lame dude because he b*tches about people hanging out in         his air-con Student Council room when it's not just filled with ALL         women. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, also those with male tongue fetishes you're welcome         this is the only episode that'll talk about this probably.         <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>&nbsp;Anyways, back to the main guys definitely because we can         only talk about secondary characters that much... wait, why we got this         Sakura character development thing? Haha okay, never mind, let's talk         about it. Firstly, about Sakura. She dropped some papers, got caught by         Ishikawa to help because you gotta (no really, you gotta, if you're a         gentleman), and you know, that's how the dude remembered her now.         Normally we wouldn't even bother to give a damn because that's how Anime         works despite the obvious hair colour difference they won't even mention         if it's on Miyamura lol. Hey, remember Anime that have all the same hair         colour? Me neither. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, and in like what seems like         forever, they crushed the heck out of everyone in the room about         Miyamura hanging out with Hori. And when I mean "everyone" I meant         Remi-chan because as we learnt from last week, she's either real bossy         or just a b*tch which I would say one's a subset of the other haha, but         you know, it's just a cola. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next up, and unless you're         interested in Miyamura taking off his top in front of Hori-san because         I'm not haha (we'll see a lot of that in this series anyways because the         girl likes it HAHAHA), we talk about another person who was involved in         Miyamura's sad childhood. For me, that will be my dear friend in high         school. Even when we got into a fight, he still talked to this sad loner         who can't even apologise to patch things up haha ugh. For Miyamura, it's         Shindou in middle school. If not for him repeating a year (*looks at         Anime "Slow Start"*) when in a prestigious middle school, he would've         been with his bro supposedly, but ended up walking away from his life as         of now. You know, because he got himself a girl and this dude... let's         just say it's on the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This bro saw his friend hanging out         with a girl on the streets, and as with any other bestie he gotta ask         for the details. It's not what it seems, but you know, it seems like it,         so why not? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Somehow he treats this friend differently from         Ishikawa because the latter is kind of not that deep yet but Hori         doesn't know that this friend likes the girl so it's kinda deep. You         know, like those screaming into the void deep. (Fukaii~!!) (haha) (If         you've seen raw manga you'll get this, kinda similar to what I         described) We also got a glimpse into Miyamura's sad middle school life         (lol) again where Shindou is one of those people who will give a damn         about this loner's life, and help him out. Again, salutes to all those         who are willing to do that including my friends, because you help change         peoples' lives for the better. Really, I wouldn't even have friends if         it wasn't for... well Miyamura doesn't to so we're even. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>         Lastly, Hori-san's the ONLY idiot who got a fever in summer. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>         Okay, I really didn't want to sh*t on her but she made the joke herself         so I gotta haha. And just like his hardworking mother, they still go to         school/work even if they the sun rubbing on their foreheads but you         know, thank goodness her brother Souta knows better. Seriously, way         better than the mother who still goes to work probably not even knowing         her daughter is unwell, whether it's now her for kid her. Hey, gotta         burn you somehow with all this fever talk haha. And as expected,         Miyamura comes to visit because Souta called the ambulance which         coincidentally links to his phone lmao. And I guess, mistaken by as the         mother, this... I can say boyfriend right? This "friend" here somehow is         playing the role of the mother and you know, got scolded for it. (Get         it? The mother is supposed to be caring but hers is not?) Hori-san, it's         called "I want you to be by my side", please. You know, when the mom         can't. Ugh, I can't even stop roasting that mom lol. Also, if you want         him to say that part again, Kyouko, and you don't want to hear it,         pretty sure you're a sadist, can confirm. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, thanks         Sengoku for informing us that Hori is a sadist lol, Ishikawa got shot by         everyday life HoriMiya again (lol me with the title drop) and Yuki-chan         being         <a href="https://jisho.org/search/esper" target="_blank">esper</a> is         totally unexpected but now we know. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Ah, all in a day of this         wonderful romance series haha please tell me the drop is coming because         at this rate where Miyamura tries to hide his confessions and Hori not         accepting them, this is going to go either way, and boy will I be around         to see it go the other way haha cya guys next week       </div>      <div>        [Also, a warning to the Anime production and/or the author: Please don't         put any further         <a href="https://jisho.org/search/BL" target="_blank">BL</a> shit into         this series or else I'm stopping haha you have been warned]       </div>      <div>        <div class="thumbnail">          <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">            <table               align="center"               cellpadding="0"               cellspacing="0"               class="tr-caption-container"               style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"             >              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img                       border="0"                       data-original-height="720"                       data-original-width="1280"                       src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8goJKjsq4Xk/YBZbOHZ79cI/AAAAAAABBhY/UnnfZW4SdAwEpTIw9F-SR8FGGqnzB8unQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya04_group.jpg"                       width="320"                     />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    When my friends decide to hang out at my place<br />(Sorry                     but I gotta make this joke on myself haha)                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>          <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">            <table               align="center"               cellpadding="0"               cellspacing="0"               class="tr-caption-container"               style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"             >              <tbody>                <tr>                  <td style="text-align: center;">                    <img                       border="0"                       data-original-height="720"                       data-original-width="1280"                       src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7FeZf6olT8w/YBZbOwuGicI/AAAAAAABBhc/_c9IP0YcIl4s6hwGhtLSGe6jpoUlJjlnQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya04_sengoku2.jpg"                       width="320"                     />                  </td>                </tr>                <tr>                  <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                    When my friends decide to hang out at my place<br />(Sorry                     but I gotta make this joke on myself haha)                   </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>          </div>        </div>        P.S.

Between playing Red Dead       Online now and receiving birthday month vouchers after I've pre-ordered       TWO photobooks, this has been a great week so far lol oh well let's watch       some Anime then<br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="AttackOnTitan67">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span             class="head-prefix"             ><b>アニメ</b></span           ><span style="font-size: large;">            Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season</span           >        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "... They are island demons threatening to destroy our world" Uh huh,           Gabi, education be a two-sided sword, dear girl. She doesn't even           know, she doesn't even         </div>      </blockquote>      Well, regardless of her fate, I'm saluting to admire Gabi's... bravery? In       protecting or more like, exacting revenge for her comrades. Good job,       girl, good job. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (67) where the Paradis people       decide to leave because Eren's all used up lol, because apparently, Eren's       actions were not with permission. Basically speaking, Levi and the       squad(s) came to save his Titan butt. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> You know, that's how you       know after you get punched in the face lol. So, apparently, plenty of       something happened, just so you know, and if you don't believe Gabi is       going to do something about all this now that the enemy is escaping       because they've sort of completed their objective (we'll talk about that       later), you might want to think again. So firstly, Gabi's actions in this       episode so far. Maybe it's luck, maybe it's real skill because she isn't       too bad either, she still ran after the enemy even though Falco stopped       her, told her he wanted to take her place in being the next Warrior (and       let her be a housewife instead lol), and also revealed to her why the       enemy was after them because they started it first... Gabi still went for       it, trying to take them down from their ends of their world. Okay, not       that chances are slim, but for the guy Lobov who took the rear of the       airship whilst everyone is celebrating their victory... you gotta wonder.       With a swipe of a gun, and Lobov's hesitation of killing a kid (okay bro),       he got shot in the face with a rifle like what, some few feet into the       air? Yeah, Gabi was quite the sniper. And dragging his gear on the ground,       Gabi thought this would be a good opportunity to catch up the enemy. And       so she did. Surprisingly, Falco didn't let go. I meant, didn't let Gabi       who is now flying towards the ship go, not didn't let her go up in the       first place. Oh well. You can guess a little what happened. They got the       jump on them, or Gabi did, and shot... I can't even say, dear Sasha in the       chest. Damn. The whole Paradis may not be kid killers but this kid is an       adult killer. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, joke's over, moving on. And if you saw the       eyecatch (just pause the video you idiot) (lol), Gabi only got 5 bullets.       She shot once on that last dude on the rear of the airship, and one (RIP)       on Sasha. So... obviously, everyone stopped the two at their feet the       moment she fired the gun anyways, but yeah, that friendly reunion between       Jean and Connie was their last. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Anyways, sad things over if you       watched this far so good on you lol, but yeah, let's talk battle       situation. And apparently, it's more spicy than it looks. As the detained       kids were being brought to the front room where Levi is torturing Eren?       And Zeke? Wait wait what is happening here? So, a little bit of context.       There is a traitor among us. Not referencing the game, just speaking       facts. And not like it's a traitor for the Paradis people no no, it's the       other way around. As Zeke speaks soundly about most of the stuff going       along to his plan when it was Eren's plan to make sure he can delay the       attack on their island and letting the Corps come to save his a**, this       was quite another turnaround. Hey, something probably already broke out       when some dude wanted to announce to the world what military situation       they were in lol. Among them was Yelena, who apparently is a Marleyan, but       was also working for the Paradis side? I guess we'll know more soon       because seriously I don't remember this guy tbh. All in all... didn't I       say that you were the 2nd coolest in this series so far, Sasha? I'm not       taking back my comment Levi can so fuck himself haha <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> I didn't come       here to be sad man... And I think moving on, we will see what made this       mission possible, with the involvement of the Survey Corps who probably       wasn't involved in this war in the first place. Remember? They were       freaking goons who were scared to leave the walls? Yep, we'll find out       more soon. Also, a great way to see Sasha... again... <span title="*sob*">😢</span>     </div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                       border="0"                       data-original-height="1080"                       data-original-width="1920"                       src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GaZzDOhFpUM/YBlbYw--P9I/AAAAAAABBkM/oD9knWl0I0IkQ785Wc6C8e4FWilWmVEhgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan67_friends.jpg"                       width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Just this is making me sad already, no joke                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table             align="center"             cellpadding="0"             cellspacing="0"             class="tr-caption-container"             style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"           >            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img                       border="0"                       data-original-height="1080"                       data-original-width="1920"                       src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s-XilFwzhRI/YBlbY2TTlsI/AAAAAAABBkQ/ChpGJ2alYaIQG-o6L-6gqAslDiq0j6NXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan67_zeke2.jpg"                       width="320"                   />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Every time I fart lmao sorry I gotta make this joke I know                   this was a sad episode                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

"So many people ran over (Udo) until they crushed his head" Okay       Gabi that sounds like an idiot to me you can't save yourself let alone       save others dude<br />      <br />      <div>        <blockquote class="tr_bq">          <div style="text-align: center;">            <span               style="background: var(--secondary); border-radius: 5px; padding: 3px 5px; text-align: center;"               ><b>音楽</b></span             >            <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>          </div>        </blockquote>        Well, let's talk about music this week because you know, why not find         more songs to listen on a week that already has a lot of songs releasing         haha. So, <b>Yoru no Honki Dance's new mini-album</b> is quite a meh,         but I did pick the one song they are going to reveal a music video out         of so good I made the right choice lol.         <b>yorushika's new mini-album</b> is I swear I'm just here for the         ending theme for that Anime movie which rocked the country as in Japan,         and then maybe that other song that has a music video too.         <b>Fuchigami Mai's new album</b> and single are... okay at best, so I'm         just giving songs off impression, and looks like only the newer songs         got to me, so basically the topic song from the single, and         <a           href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1354265078623727616?s=20"           target="_blank"           >you can guess</a         >        from         <a           href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1354376944645640193?s=20"           target="_blank"           >the tweets</a         >        I made what I gave for the album haha. Last but not least, I heard this         song, shamed to admit to be honest, a YouTube clip which likes to put         ending songs and this song got me, so I listened to... uh...         <b>sana's collaboration single</b> from 2017? I don't know, they slapped         three names on it and I almost gave two. Haha I didn't, I gave up on the         third track so I just got what I came for eventually.<br />        <br />        In news concerning Twitter and music for maybe or maybe not I can talk         about because Klassic Note has hidden rules all over the place this past         decade, I've been listening to <b>VTubers and them singing songs</b> so         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Y-UnC2HQo" target="_blank"           >whether</a         >        it's         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cqV5BKJHyk" target="_blank"           >original</a         >        or         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAr2lHZLNyU" target="_blank"           >cover</a         >        I'm also not officially giving any of them (I just slap them to my         Favourites playlist only) (And no Nanawo Akari I'm not giving you         another chance... yet), I talked about         <a           href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1355125090560606214?s=20"           target="_blank"           ><b>music recommendations from Anime seiyuus</b></a         >        ie. voice actors/actress alike on their tastes and I guess Kana-chan         suits my tastes the best so I'll be listening to a couple of those next         week likely, Base Ball Bear's new song is not much so I'll see what's up         for them since their album early last year which I rejected too lol,         <b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new music video</b> is touching but not on the         audio part, <b>Yuuki Aoi's new single</b> will be releasing in April for         new season Anime of course (with Waki Azumi doing the ending theme for         the same Anime so what figures),         <b>SHE'S is releasing weekly live recordings</b> in limited time         recording so I will not link the videos but you can follow their YouTube         channel to find out more         <a           href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1355156324980457472?s=20"           target="_blank"           >I saw the one this week</a         >        it was an acoustic live from their 1st full album which I did review,         their new song isn't that great but wins the previous two I mentioned         lol, <b>SCANDAL released a new live video on YouTube</b> so please go         check out that lovely emotional song, and         <b>Uesaka Sumire's upcoming single</b> is surprise surprise, opening         theme to that "Nagatoro-san" Anime next season.&nbsp;<br />        <br />So for next week, if I'm not wrong         <b>Andou Yuuko's new single</b> will be out for Anime "Attack on Titan",         and yes as mentioned above thanks to Kana-chan's recommendation I'll be         giving <b>Yukarisa's album</b> a listen. Let's hope the latter is good         don't expect the former to appear as a Klassic Note Review. Well, I may         have said it too early but hey, remember we gave like King Gnu? Or even         Ueda Reina? Yeah, those were the times haha<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />So, what do you think of this week? I think it was fantastic, and         yes sadly I'm not talking about whatever is above me so far haha. Well,         I've been playing a lot of Red Dead Online learning that it was out as a         standalone game from like a couple of days ago so I've been downloading         and playing that over the weekend completing daily objectives because         that's how you get Gold in the game. I know it's a grind, but I like to         explore the world so far as much as it's tiring because I'm an old man         now (like those in the game), so let's see if I can continue playing the         game for a month since the streak will be over anyways, and then forget         about spending ~4.99USD in March haha. Anyways, thanks for reading, and         cya guys next week, and until then... I really gotta take naps the total         time I spent afternoons sleeping this weekend is zero lol       </div>    </div>    <div><br /></div>    <div>      P.S. Yes, if you got baited to read about the upcoming package instead of       anything else I've mentioned so far, plan is there are two photobooks as       main show I think I mentioned that before Ajuju has an opponent to defeat       even though I'm sure she will win lol, we have Koga Aoi and Ookubo Rumi       for Valentine's Day (cards and bromides) (haha), and Taketatsu Ayana's       upcoming livestream is releasing goods which somehow, contains bromides.       So yeah, kiss goodbye to my wallet would you? Thank goodness I bought a       new photo album to keep these in hehe until then     </div>  </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
