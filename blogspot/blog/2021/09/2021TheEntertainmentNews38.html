I know it has been fast, and I did take work leave on Friday lmao, but hey, when you start working you can never get enough breaks just because. Hey, kids, trust me, you'll miss them so enjoy them when you're still studying without purpose in life. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> <div><br /></div><div>  Well, I'm just typing all this life talk because my life has been rough   this week. Well, sort of. Mostly the second shot kicking in since Friday night and   literally killing me all day on Saturday but at least I know I will be able to   do this post on Sunday, so thank goodness. To quote my sis on this case "which   is why always take Friday leave (for vaccination)" haha thanks sis. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Anyways, we can talk about Anime and music now, so let's get to it! </div><div><br /></div><div>  We are sending off Anime starting this week, and I have been tipped a lot   about next season's Anime I think I know what to watch already lol, but hey,   before that is done, let's clear this bunch, yes?<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TanMoshi11">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tantei wa Mou, Shindeiru.</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "If you don't know how to live life, you can walk in line with someone       else!" Wise words said here, Kimizuka.     </div>  </blockquote>  Hey, that's how Kimizuka started out in the... android hunting mystery solving   business lol. Unwillingly but he learnt a lot from the famous detective   herself, one would say. In this new episode (#TanMoshi11) where I actually   forgot Saikawa is on their side now, so yeah, not even spoiler alert tbh,   Nagisa didn't die for the cause. Well, more like, we don't have to sacrifice   another for the cause. So yeah, story. After a whole lot of talk which   should've wrapped up since last week lol, we finally reached Kimizuka's   decision upon that ship that has Chameleon on it: he is not gonna let Nagisa   die. Yeah of course, she does have Siesta's heart after all. So with   Kimizuka's most impressive gun shot in this series lol, he clips the tail in   half, sending Nagisa down to the ocean below her... to be honest even if it   lands in the sea she should be fine but yeah, Saikawa had to do the more   glorious way, by sending like, those firefighter use landing pads to catch   Nagisa where she landed lol. Anyways, they are safe, the people on the cruise   are probably safe considering help is here, but we're not done yet. To deal   with Chameleon who is like, an android, against this sidekick who can't even   be half competent in fighting, we gotta believe some help is on the way. We   gotta. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And so comes in Charlotte in a helicopter somehow, driven by   Fuubi-san yes the real one haha, in an effort to stop this SPES android from   leaving. It didn't go well if you can believe, sending the heli away leaking   fuel while also using that fuel to conveniently burn the enemy alive mainly   also to reveal his camouflage powers, but the enemy had other plans to deal   with this sidekick one on one. Of course, not a great idea, we do not have any   more plans left unlike if this is Siesta's heist, which brings us to the real   thing. Siesta herself. Remember last time through the flashback where   technically speaking Hel took Siesta's heart literally to her possession?   Yeah, that was probably a bad idea, for Hel. Because if you thought of how Nagisa   mentioned earlier in this series that her actions are dictating what she does   even though she's like a normal high school girl? That wasn't a lie by the   way, because if an enemy were to do this which was apparently according to the   detective's plan, that means Hel just got herself stolen consciousness because   Siesta can now take over her identity going forward. Well, for as long as she can. Surprisingly, until the nicer self resurfaces. Yes, cue a couple of   episodes ago with the flashbacks, we are talking about Alicia. So yeah, Alicia   is the nicer side of Hel, basically. Siesta said it will take some time to kill this woman,   Kimizuka did kind of forget some things like who Alicia was, but he still   remembered that even if it took three years and her conscious was taken to   another body ie. Nagisa-chan here because with context, she has the best   background to be able to blend into Kimizuka's life as a classmate, would   be the best way to join back into his life in their mission to take down SPES.   So yep, in case you didn't realize by now, Nagisa will be taking the final   kill on Chameleon. Well, all in all, I must say at least the storytelling   makes sense, but the story might have dragged on too long, considering   Charlotte was literally there just for show now even Saikawa played a bigger role   in this arc lol, and yeah, they didn't really make this obvious until they had to,   the reveal. But hey, it's good enough for such a series, and it will make more   sense with the subtle hints that you may have missed including Siesta's ribbon   on Nagisa's possession. Yeah but a fistfight with Kimizuka is not going to be   a thing, in case you wonder haha. I must say though, that Siesta's "everything   was planned from the beginning" strategy still holds true even in this arc,   because it has been her plan to stop SPES through Hel,   and letting her disciplines do the rest of the work even if it means   sacrificing herself. So yeah, it was a complete story overall. Let's see who's   gonna start crying next week in the final episode lol ALREADY?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh   well haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; Come on, tell me Siesta <strike>ended up in</strike> chose Nagisa not   because of her circumstances but because she has a similar body figure as   herself haha YES] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-joFM9Thm4PY/YUbiX3826AI/AAAAAAABH-8/fK846ZZvPTc7wyoDLWIMEEcN-j11F2_VQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tanmoshi11_fistfight.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Hey Kimizuka?

The curse that someone spelled on this kid when he was five. The curse   that kills all living beings on contact. The curse that prevents him from   being with Alice for the rest of his life, having s*x with her day and night-   Okay that last bit may not be true but still. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We've got a lot to talk   about, so sit tight. Firstly, Viola-chan doing the rebellious child thing   trying to leave home. Well, the old mansion is technically still her home, but   at least inform your brother about it so he can still go to the dining table   for the day, yes? I know the mom hasn't done evil stuff like ground their kids   because they misbehave, but Viola-chan can we not get to that? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Also,   great sub-plot if Viola were to be a servant in the old mansion but yeah if   season two ever happens(?) make that an Anime original, yes? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on,   Viola did bring her luggage over so she decides to stay a night in protest of   the mom, and Cuff drops by uninvited. Well, pot calling the kettle black so   Alice if you feel the bed is too small for the three of you just like how Cuff   feels when wearing Viola's sleepwear BOOM GOT HER, you can go sleep with   Bocchan at his room. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Next up, we talk about lore. It's here, people,   so spoiler alert if you haven't watched this, for Daleth, technically Zain's   boss and an expert witch herself, asked Zain for a favour. If you thought "to   deliver a message" was it, think again. So turns out, surprise surprise,   Daleth has been lying all along it seems, so good to know the traitor's "among   us" (not video game reference, I'm sorry) but at the least for Zain, he's   trying to be the good friend thing by doing what he is told but not in the   most direct way intended. For context, that means burning away that   servant's log Viola found in the main mansion with Walter and passing it to   Alice for reading because why would anyone not read it first and tell her the   truth lmao, and of course why would Alice not read through it overnight before   it gets stolen by Zain to be burnt... well at least Bocchan got to witness   Zain's evil deed... well it wasn't evil he was threatened anyways so go   figure. (Yes Cuff and her sexy body blah blah we get it) (lol) In protest of course, and we know that will become a problem, Zain chose to not   burn it directly (see before he was found out, red flame vs blue now) but disintegrate it   to pieces using his own magic leaving a fragment as he explains to Bocchan,   can be restored as long as he possess that piece. Which sounds great for   explanation for Daleth who is literally placing CCTV cameras all over the   mansion to monitor these guys for some reason, which yes, is more intentional   than you think. The biggest clue we have so far is from an excerpt Alice read   of the logbook: Her mother has been visited by two nuns privately with Rob not   even noticing. One would question why would you write stuff like this in the   book but hey, no one knew you wouldn't take that to your grave so go figure.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I'll leave the detective level analysis for you for now, but all in   all, with the mom summoning his son (lol context people, context is 100 years   ago) into the main mansion and asking for literal death haha, and looking from   the cliffhanger... I'm excited to see what happens in the final episode. Yeah,   it's the "f**k you mom" situation it seems (Audience: You meant Bocchan's mom   or Alice's mom?) (Yes), because it looks like Alice's mom Sharon might have   been dealing with the witches when she was around. Also, how she passed away   is also a mystery. I guess we will find out in the final episode then. Wow, is   this going to win best ending this season? We shall see how this goes soon   enough. This series has not been so evil until this episode tbh </div><div>  [TL:DR; (SPOILER ALERT) Going from the scars on the Daleth's face... looks   like someone went for plastic surgery after casting a curse on a certain human   boy, you <i>half-witch</i>. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> Haha I like a villain voiced by   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/7263/Youko_Hikasa" target="_blank">Hikasa Youko</a>;&nbsp;It has been a while Yocchan] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RsQtlP1PDPI/YUbkMia8pdI/AAAAAAABH_c/J68n-JHcBbsngfANojWNdHfe3-ieQOC5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan11_stare.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me when I- Okay never mind haha             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EiX155yWXyc/YUbkTsHAN4I/AAAAAAABH_g/bZvvfx1bLfo7BT8bwZvjzA-iClJq4xTcACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/shinigamibocchan11_walter4.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Me when the cashier didn't hear me say two servings and only made               one lol<br />(Hey Walter, I can make as many of these jokes as you               want)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Okay Nagisa-chan you worried about that?? lol     </div>  </blockquote>  Can confirm Naoya is masochist lol look at how many hits he took from   Saki-chan haha since elementary school too?? Well, they are childhood friends   I wouldn't be surprised but still. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this final episode we continue   the talk about Nagisa's story and why it matters (#KanoKano12), I think we   have reached the ideal conclusion for such a controversial series, and I mean   that. And if you think it is Naoya ending up with only ONE girlfriend, just...   leave. Get out. Run away. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, story first before we talk about   everything else that is also screwed up haha. Story goes that we were   listening to Nagisa's story with Saki-chan after she punched Naoya out of the   girls' bath lmao, and what is her with Naoya that made her this way. I won't   talk too much into this because there's literally part two of this, but   thinking back even now hearing what Nagisa had to say, I would say she learnt   from the best of the best... maybe. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Because seriously thinking, Naoya   was the one who told her not to give up. Naoya was the one who gave her life.   Naoya was the one who pushed her to do everything against her will just so   she can pull off a confession to her first love. This determination is so   strong, I think even Naoya is going to lose to her. Since thinking back, we   have noticed that Nagisa has literally been fuelled by one fact from Naoya:   That he has never given up confessing to ambivalent Saki-chan since... well   Naoya knew of love I guess haha, and that everything he does, is all for the   girl he likes. This, I must say Nagisa has learnt well. Too well even. And   since we know she has always been a try-hard from the previous episode,   getting a try-hard to achieve excellence is almost an impossible task,   especially when you know your distance between you and the guy you like. Yet   she did it. She has overcame all this just for an attempt for her feelings to   be returned. This, I can't help but feel bad for Nagisa-chan all this while.   (Also, how lack of determination I had to my first love... <span title="*sigh*">😩</span>) It seems so   futile in life that you try so hard to get what you want but can potentially   never get, and even if so they have to make sacrifices because of your   selfishness... I wished this series didn't exist. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yes, in case you   haven't noticed that no one is behind those two running down the streets yet   they might be taking it on the highway lmao, just like Nagisa-chan when she   started to love him (okay what is with the cinematic pillar box effect haha),   Naoya will NOT give up. That, is a virtue as it's also a problem. I mean, look   at Saki-chan now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So you see, this feeling is mutual. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I   don't know how much to describe this series, but seeing Nagisa-chan open up to   her feelings instead of trying so hard to cover things up and be number two   (okay <a href="#shinigamibocchan11">Walter</a> calm down lol) this has been   quite a ride. Seriously, now that we have even let Shion on this who <span title="*wink*">😉</span>   has something on Naoya too but I don't think my brain can take four-timing   lmao, I'm just glad Saki-chan's mom will never hear of it for now. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in   all... I must say this is the most controversial romance series I've watched   yet. And I've watched Anime for almost 15 years now. Maybe the comedy did make   this a lot light-hearted than it should have been because think of "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/41103/Koi_to_Yobu_ni_wa_Kimochi_Warui" target="_blank">KoiKimo</a>" on age gap this series could've been like that if the mom heard about it,   but it didn't. Instead, the author chose to put this in self-ridicule mode,   and explore what it means to have a controversial relationship in the face of   reality while making sure none of us will dare to do this in our lives.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> No really, please don't try this, not even secretly. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But   yes, it is a lot to absorb in the final episode, but I think it ended up   pretty much as expected. Well, if expected means they still get to be together, the   three of them but now it's war between the girls lol, then so be it. This is Anime world it's   not real life so who cares what happens to any of them down the road lmao.   Deep down in my heart though?   <u>I give this series a thumbs up for comedy AND the guts to talk about     two-timing relationships in the most entertaining and emotional way ever.</u>  This, I'm glad I picked this series up to watch. I may not be falling in love   with Naoya but maybe for the girls at least... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div>  [TL:DR; "I had to date both of them" This series in a nutshell haha you're   welcome] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C0KGHgYVmc4/YUbo5CYSkhI/AAAAAAABH_8/kbHAYltOA-AEjj7TTtqZe5AazVbdoA-QACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano12_milika.jpg" width="320" />            </td>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uIWfUBbzZl4/YUbo5pEQlaI/AAAAAAABIAA/CvQBv07KsAEQm3AE824Ap16s35fVG-pagCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano12_shion5.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">              Okay let's vote on who did it better<br />(Haha I'm sorry               Shion-san I'll kill myself right now)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="2463" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8YBvQGDjzxs/YUbpFInRvAI/AAAAAAABIAE/ybgAw3R4H_QzV14g_8cHRneUOzMxadyuwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/kanokano12_nagishort3.jpg" width="616" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              If you don't zoom in to see the flaws you'll realize how perfect               this is<br />(Audience: Do you mean Nagisa or this patching?)

Alone. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay you guys can leave me now haha but   before that let's talk about this week's episode (#SonnyBoy10), yes? And can   we stop talking about girls who I've not confessed to because they have read   my mind and could not be bothered with me? Man, what is with this series haha.   Anyways, ignoring the reality checks because it's too much even for one   episode lol, we talk about... what's her name? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh well, give me a   minute while I check. *checks website* Okay,   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kossetsu" target="_blank">Kossetsu</a> is   what I got from translating her name so... well just remind yourself her left   arm is still recovering. Always, since this is adrift mode here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> This   feels like another character focus episode and I think they still have the   liberty to talk about that, but we are getting some story too, so hear me out.   And no, we are nowhere close to a romance series question mark? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Firstly, about her powers. This girl which we have not been noticing and is a   friend of Nozomi... she has powers. She lied about her powers clearly when   asked for, because hers is pretty vital in keeping the truths about being in this   world: The truth about everyone's thoughts. Yes, she has mind-reading powers.   Also, thanks to Aki-sensei we now actually know how her relativity power   works, because she can manipulate her world to understand anyone's powers,   despite the lack of realization in the first place. The girl is still right   though: No one knew about her power, but she knows everyone's thoughts. From   the bestie who thinks the same way she acts so no surprises there, to Kaga who   likes her but will never bring up his guts to do so lol literally me, and   Asakaze who she likes despite his crude yet dishonest personality and attitude   specifically towards his crush Nozomi. Yep, I sense a triangle relationship   happening lol I was talking about with Nagara, please. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, with   the reveal of her powers though, it might have brought Nozomi and Asakaze   together for a while, even though it's still not Asakaze being a man to prove   his worth to the girl he likes but just sitting high above his ego thinking   that he's cool he should get laid. Oh well, next time, brother. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Moving on I guess, we   talk about the talk about War. Yes, remember that dude Yamabiko was in contact   with before? Eh... let's think about it this way which might be easier to some   of you I guess: Aki-sensei and Asakaze met Voice who told them to kill War,   who he thinks is creating chaos in this world. Yeah, Nagara met that Voice guy   too, remember? So yeah, take all this with a pinch of salt- I think War is   doing God's deed here. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, surrealism, remember? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And as the   group go to confront what they thought was War in some clay desert down a   major crevice or something he certainly looks different from the last time we   saw him lol, and as Asakaze got rid of him in an instant turning him into a   gun which Voice is holding and shot in response? Yeah, don't worry, I didn't   get it either. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> What I did get is Asakaze failing to catch Nozomi as   she falls into the abyss, LITERALLY standing at the edge of the cliff. Yeah,   that'll happen lol. (Oh yeah she's dead alright;   <a href="https://twitter.com/Madhouse_News/status/1438926327046762496?s=20" target="_blank">Her power</a>  is left on the ledge) And we ended with Mizuho's cats ordering live chicken   haha yeah kinda expected Mizuho hating the killing of living things which is   probably why Sakura will never order anything living. It's okay, Nagara, you   don't have to do a demonstration of that haha. All in all, are we even inching   closer to the truth? I don't know. I feel like the Halo playthroughs I've   watched over the weekend may have reached it by now lol, but not with this   series. Voice can still be on any side he wishes to be or he can be   representative of the <strike>Devil</strike> principal himself, but we can at   least confirm that the world can be changed, starting with this War guy. What   can happen next though? We still have a couple of episodes left, so I can't   imagine what else but outside of our knowledge this series can pull out. Just   don't tell me it's a dream or something or else I'm suing the director lol   okay you can leave now haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; If the best monologue you have heard this episode is not "Aki-sensei's   boobs" you need to stop watching Anime right now lmao] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rl6cIdOL8zE/YUbeM9p-BEI/AAAAAAABH-c/SDgljKaKpXwFiGSIygcNNWWcL7I7EEqkACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/sonnyboy10_magicschoolbus.gif" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Is this literally a               <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MgaXP4HhN9o/YUbrLnT0DYI/AAAAAAABIAg/6E-c7r-BrNsBZWX0K_rnFB0UBkDgJdrFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/series_4.jpg" target="_blank">magic school bus</a>              reference??

How is my dad still on the rock festival   stage but these guys aren't .WHY!!! <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay I'm good for now lol </div><div>  <br />So for next week, I know, me, that we have <i>only</i> (lol)   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%BD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0-single/1582798921?l=en" target="_blank">Porno Graffitti's new single</a></b>  since three years ago and as you can see I'm not exactly hyped they only got   my attention for a couple of years in and out, and   <b>Earphones' new mini-album</b>&nbsp;which is also concept album I guess they   greeted the international population with their Tweets, but since I've been   dabbling all around over the weekend from these Tweets and earlier in this   post, we will be listening to   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%84%9B%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E6%84%9B%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A6-ep/1543671598?l=en" target="_blank">PURPLE HUMPTY's latest single</a></b>  technically from 2020 because I didn't even know they're back and it's their   15th anniversary right now (they...are along the lines of VELTPUNCH, not   popular, but   <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1438873847592222721?s=20" target="_blank">still around</a>) Hololive VTuber   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/chocolove/1583765156?i=1583765158&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Yuzuki Choco-sensei's first song</a></b>  just because I love her voice I'd die for it haha and yes this will be the   last one until I give an actual VTuber artist Hoshimachi Suisei, and the   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/tv-animation-sonny-boy-original-soundtrack/1582740135?l=en" target="_blank">Anime "Sonny Boy" original soundtrack</a></b>  because they have actual songs too but their release dates are... all over the   place and the physical CD release (vinyl was released earlier) is technically   around the corner but I can listen to it on music subscription ie. Apple   Music. So uh, we shall see how those go.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  So yeah, since I took my second shot and can practically do nothing for a day   besides take fever medication and sleep lol, I've been watching a playthrough   of the Halo video game series, if that is familiar to anyone reading this. In   a nutshell it's humans against aliens against bugs but humans had to fight   with aliens to exterminate the bugs which plague the universe which were   intended to be wiped out as a last resort using a series of planet-like rings   called "Halos". That is only for the first three video games so far I've   watched, by the way. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, put me now in 15 years ago and maybe   I'll be interested in this first-person shooter lmao. Cya guys next week then,   the package is well I'm waiting for one more so maybe not coming in by the end   of the month, and until then... well I'm technically vaxxed so I can say this   now: </div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Get vaxxed, people.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hehe bye</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
