<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BAtCF5JHuxo/YHGz4iOb4VI/AAAAAAABDlA/-zoMWSbTDWAGMRCCus_gX0nl6r5YdAZqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo02_ichika8.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Well, the cycling trip is right smack in the middle of the weekend, so I gotta do the Anime thing earlier. <div><br /></div><div>  Which is great too, since there's like, new shows this week so it's fine not to   get into the flow too much, and some can wait. Until then, hey we got two new   shows I intend to watch, so let's see how they fare against Ryo and   Ichika-chan haha I think I'm hooked to the theme songs already</div><div><br /></div><div>  *Watches KoiKimo and HigeHirou* WHY ARE THOSE GUYS ALL YOUNGER THAN ME??!!   Ugh, I feel hurt somehow lol I should thank these shows for making me not that   sad that I'm not yet in a relationship at 28 and that I may someday date someone who is a decade younger than me</div><div><br /></div><div>*silence*</div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, let's talk about Anime and other stuff not about my life, yes? Haha   *sob*<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo02">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I never thought I'd start daydreaming from exhaustion" I think I'm not       working hard enough to deserve this lmao     </div>  </blockquote>  Say the thing, Ichika!!! SAY THE THING!!! Oh well. I was expecting that   "dinner, bath or me" question. *laughs* Oh yeah, not yet huh. In this new   episode (#KoiKimo02) which I'm already dancing to the opening song and crying   to the ending song lol, if you have to ask me about my personality and what I   seek in a relationship, I think I can consider Ryo my mutual friend. *laughs*   Other than that, I don't think my mom will approve of a high schooler to be my   partner considering MY AGE, so Ryo you should think about that too haha. So,   story. You sure this is not the final episode? *laughs* In what seems to be   one, we start off strong with Ichika appearing in an apron (with baking tools)   in front of the door as Ryo(u) steps in (it's too late to fix the romanized   name so we shall stick with "Ryo") HIS place to find out that... he might be   already drunk lol. Interestingly, it was his sister's friends dropping by to   practice to bake for their upcoming school festival. Besides the other two   classmates totally fangirling over Ryo, the more important points (lol) in   focus are more obviously, the sister (Rio, not to be confused with Ryo the   brother, and to avoid me getting confused we be calling the sister "the   sister" instead) talking about her relationship with her brother so far, and   how somehow, Ichika brought them siblings together. Hey, Ichika-chan? You   don't have to shoulder this responsiblity to maintain their relationship. It's   the brother's fault for not refusing getting laid with other girls in the   first place. *laughs* I have a feeling we'll get to that part in this series   at some point. We also found out that the sister is actually a decade younger   than Ryo, which will explain how this series of a romance story can even   happen in the first place. Well, I have an elder sister so I'm screwed in   finding partners through my sister so *laughs* Anyways, age shouldn't be an   issue anyways, but you know, not like my sistser's friend saw anything in me.   (Yep I got me) Moving on, we have another character to introduce other than   the two classmates who are just adding to the Ryo fanclub size lol. It's   Masuda, Ryo's friend since middle school, a freelance photographer, and   somehow got wind of his friend liking a high schooler. *laughs* Okay, he   didn't put it this nice so I guess he's as weird as his friend haha. It is   kind of obvious this is the serious relationship we are talking about her   other than the queue long of women   <strike>Ryo has laid his hands on</strike> who have laid their hands on him   (lol), so yeah, his friend got weirdly excited in the bar he's celebrating it   before we even finish this season. Didn't I say this is last episode-like   already? *laughs* Then, it's the school festival. Ryo takes Masuda to show him   to Ichika-chan after his friend doxxed the heck out of her calling her at 1AM   in the morning (thanks for the insults Ichika lol "I should call her in the   middle of the night more often" haha says Ryo), they are then also here to   look around the festival and of course, first visit the Japanese cafe Ryo's   sister's class is hosting for the festival. The sister paves a perfect path   for the couple to go have some time alone walking around the festivities (poor   Masuda with the cake), the two had some time to play some games which got them   vouchers for the food stalls (shoutout to the one guy who got hit for it   lmao), and wait for it... Ryo saved Ichika's life. Now we're even. *laughs*   Okay, not really. The flight of stairs Ryo was about to fall from considering   his height too is going to be worse than this one. (I speak from experience,   the height part) And as Ryo kindly told Ichika to wait as he gets the food,   she... thought about how well Ryo smells. Well, it's cologne, so it's kind of   dependent on how you view it (my mom just HATES it when I do it for work for   some reason), and we got a smooth transition to the ending. You think the   ending is more smooth or Ryo's flirting with anyone who is not Ichika? Haha   man, this is already a rollercoaster ride I DON'T want to miss hehe so yes I'm   already giving it. I just hope for more emotional moments when it's deemed   important so it can really give the ending song more impact, but other than   that... I can take more sadist and masochist jokes lol because I like that   shit haha not the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/uke" target="_blank">uke</a> and the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/seme" target="_blank">seme</a> just the   jokes only lol Ichika please don't </div><div>  [TL:DR; This series in a nutshell: "Is it true that you are messing around   with a high school girl?" lmao] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IC9GJuLPB3k/YHGzdxcsQGI/AAAAAAABDkw/o9r8twTMRzgMtNgg4Kvl1NfIYc_SbpvDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo02_shove.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week in violence we have(?):<br />Their service is so good               they shove food down your throat lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SmJRbHcz5aY/YHGzeX9D5VI/AAAAAAABDk0/gVllaFEzLF46vhtwkxaYZaMhnyPcerLXgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo02_this.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              "This one is the drink with the drug" lol if you don't get this               don't ask             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

This. This Anime. *laughs*     </div>  </blockquote>  Between this drop and the one in "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/40839/Kanojo_Okarishimasu" target="_blank">KanoKari</a>" with the "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/wakare" target="_blank">wakare</a>yo" drop, I think this one is way better haha ah hey at least this Yoshida   had the guts to ask her out the other one was in heaven and then got dropped   lol. Also, why is it all about high schoolers this season?   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/shikamo" target="_blank">Even worse</a>,   it's about high schoolers and adults. Haha I sense a theme here in the Anime I   watch this season lol. In the first episode of "I'll let you do me if you let   me stay over at your place" lmao (#HigeHirou01) did I warn you about the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a> references   that will be in this Anime over the previous one above? Not yet? Okay you have   been warned. *laughs* So, story. Story is not about sex, thankfully. To start,   there's this guy called Yoshida, and he's about to ask the girl out to his   place, you know, wink wink, and then realized that the woman was already   attached. Welp. Worse case scenario ever. *looks at KanoKari* Anyways, he gets   drunk with his buddy until the late of night and goes home, but on his way   home, he noticed some girl on the streets still outdoors despite the curfew   (In Japan, minors are not allowed to stay outdoors after a certain time, as   dictated by the government; I only learnt of one timing which is high school,   10pm), and asks her to go home like anyone would. (We'll get to the morality   of that later) But instead, the girl who doesn't have a home to go to AND   doesn't have the money to go back home, requested to stay at his place.   Temporarily, of course. Pretty easy for a woman if you think about it   considering she's in a high school uniform, but nice guy Yoshida despite being   drunk and dumped by a woman, is still wide awake and allows her to stay for   the moment, probably because he can't think any further lol. But as soon as   they reach his place, the girl asks to, you know. *silence* Please, girl. He   just finished work for the week, he got dumped by a woman who lied to him, and   you ask him he wants to have sex? I would have turned in too, please. *laughs*   Anyways, as he wakes up the next day and recalls what he did when half drunk,   he then also noticed that this girl is a high schooler all the way from   Hokkaido when they are at Tokyo now (go Google Maps to see where is where),   Sayu here says her parents are better off without her (divorce, maybe?), and   because she only knows how to seduce... guys... to survive here up till now,   she's also a spoilt brat. Because that's all they know how to do. *laughs*   Okay, I'm not going on with the biases here, but you get the idea. The idea is   just, for Yoshida's case, to educate her in the way of life and not let her   life be based on the Kamasutra lol no like, really. *laughs* She may have a   F-cup chest, she may be 17 (*salivates* ah), but that doesn't mean she has to   suffer for whatever the parents may have done to her forcing her to leave the   place where she calls home. Hey, not everyone had to live that life, just look   at me. *laughs* Anyways, Yoshida then also haphazardly decides to allow her to   stay until she can actually get her life together, and not let it be   surrounded by guys hanging out their- Uh oh his friend found out about it.   *laughs* Ignoring all laws in the country including the news he recently saw   of police arresting a guy holding up a minor at his place, Sayu is still   apparently, happily staying at someone else's place. Just that, you know, she   doesn't have to sex for it. *laughs* (Okay I should tone this down, these   jokes) As Yoshida walks home after a day's work thinking if this Sayu has   eaten (I mean, the house has to have something to eat even if it's COCK lol)   (Okay am I going to make these sex jokes for the rest of the season? Haha) he   eventually lets her settle down to not have a mind of worrying how to survive   in the city life because you know, not everyone out there is that nice. No   really, Yoshida did his research. *giggles* To conclude, I think this story   reminds me of "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/38759/Sewayaki_Kitsune_no_Senko-san" target="_blank">Senko-san</a>", but just that Senko-san probably didn't do men to survive for six months.   *laughs* Well she doesn't have to lol she's an immortal. And ignoring the   title of this where it's concerning his shave (titled "(I) shaved. And then   (I) picked up a female high schooler"), it's also wonder how this can be taken   seriously as a series similar to other romance series in the genre and not yet   dive into porno territory because just a reminder this wasn't even a DMM   pictures production so I can't even sh*t on this like "KanoKari" or   "DomeKano", amongst other things. Still, there are still a lot of questions to   answer, and I doubt this will be cleared even when his room is clean every day   and his suit is ironed so much so the girls in his office noticed, but suffice   it to say this might still be interesting to watch. And it's not even a deity   fox too; It's a literal woman. I mean, I can treat this 17-year-old as a   woman, right? Or do I have to be as sad as the guy in   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f22M7P2_Dr0" target="_blank">that Yoru no Honki Dance music video?</a>  Haha I guess we shall see how this works in the next couple of weeks. And yes,   the sort of rated stuff isn't as irritating as most of the other shows I   rejected, so I don't think I have to worry about that. Yet. Haha cya guys next   week. </div><div>  [TL:DR; This guy is not interested in a high schooler who is willing to have   sex with him. We can leave now boys 'cos the rest of this series is going to   be BORING haha if that is <i>really</i> what you think about this series you   can leave now] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7K1DNHlonQ/YHG1rYFd-ZI/AAAAAAABDlM/XnNYM0sjPSwmNt3p_WW_h5WxvP2YtsPdACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehirou01_sayu5.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              What I expected walking into this Anime               <br />(kawaii)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TWsmlPPI1uU/YHG1r0w_xYI/AAAAAAABDlQ/tlmWSxbYbC8zjnZgIHLTuBOqQDamjNcNACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehirou01_sayu6.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              What I got<br />(lol)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;">"I didn't do anything weird to you last night, right?"

'Cos I'm not. *laughs* In this... depends on how you view it   first episode (#NagataroSan01), I... I see myself in it and I'm not happy   about it. *laughs* Let's talk about why. So, story of how this weird couple   will come by. Surprisingly, it's as weird as you will imagine. Senpai, as he   will be referred to in the story, is just a shut-in, maybe introvert, maybe   hates hanging out with people especially with women, has fantasies of great   stories that will be liked by the otaku community... Basically me haha, going   to the library to study alone (okay that's not me I don't story *dabs*) but is   shocked to see a bunch of   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/gyaru" target="_blank">gals</a> hanging out   in the library, eating snacks and talking out loud. In case for those who have   NEVER been to a library before, you are supposed to keep quiet like how the   rest world is doing it now in public transportation other than Japan because   they have always lol. He tries to   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/heijoushin" target="_blank">stay calm</a>&nbsp;but eventually, the two forces come into contact. We at least know that   the senpai is rather talented in art (to draw this well of a manga takes a lot   of practice and creativity), but of course, gets sh*t on by the main girl in   the series, which is of course, one of the girls in the gal group. But instead   of the others who chose to leave because their friend is outside of school,   this girl Nagatoro as we have found out her name by the end of the episode,   chose to mingle with this loner and... wait for it, tease, uh, I mean, bully   the heck out of her senior in school. Well, not like anyone will give a damn   nowadays but she did make him cry, so yay for you, I guess. *sigh* Moving on,   and if this is not obvious of a 4-koma in original series because it's all   shorts here, she visits the art club her senpai goes to, to you know, pose as   a model for him. He does a fantastic job but you know, the insults still has   to happen so I would compare the ecchi level of this to "HigeHirou" above too,   to be honest. Just that, you know, look at her and you lose lol. Again, this   is not even close to "Takagi-san", not even. Even on the way home, ironically   they take the same route lol how have you not been bullied since then, but   despite even being pushed into the nearby canal, he still left her bullying   a** alone. I know, right? Believing in a confession is so not 2021 anymore,   isn't it. *laughs* Anyways, I don't want to sh*t on this guy because as we   have seen from flashbacks, he's not good with people and me too brother we can   be friends, but suffice it to say this is basically how the flow goes. It's   "Takagi-san" but the embarrassment comes from Nagatoro laughing at your sorry   a** ALL. THE TIME. I mean, like even the cast is great with Uesaka Sumire,   Komatsu Mikako, Suzuki Aina... I wish this was like "Hatena Illusion" but   sadly, it's not. So no. No way. I can't watch this for another 12 episodes   just like how the senpai can't stare at these f**ks for any longer. *laughs*   I'll still give the theme songs though, again production level is great with   all the reactions, but crying shouldn't be part of them. Then again, then this   series wouldn't have sold well. You sick f**ks out there lol we're done</div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DTLPEYvFhYo/YHKwhzR0agI/AAAAAAABDmU/Pi5YUlq42O4nEj1MFcUxxTIl44Tx4PLqACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/nagatorosan01_bully.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        The series is so good I want to animate this but so bad I don't want to</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td style="text-align: center;">        <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kGTF-Gcusgg/YHKwi1mIHlI/AAAAAAABDmY/QM-9pLfnNkYYAeIrVSocYAuYamkrrW83wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/nagatorosanOP_sumipe.jpg" width="320" />      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">        Great reference here lol I wouldn't have known this is illegal in school         lmao       </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></div>  </div>  P.S. "Damn, this is better than Two Piece" Shoutout to that popular series in   Japan selling millions lmao GREAT REFERENCE haha </div><div>  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>      <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>    </div>  </blockquote><div>There's quite a lot to talk about this week in music, so let's talk about what I listened. <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/music-wardrobe/1557238100?l=en" target="_blank">FIVE NEW OLD's new album</a></b> was first reviewed and is actually a mistake, because I may have given too many songs from them thus far listening to them, and I think that's good that means they will have a chance on Top 20 this year haha. On the other hand, it's ruining my experience for <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/three/1559496693?l=en" target="_blank">SIX LOUNGE's new album</a></b> which, despite the fact that their style - as I mentioned years ago and now - is very classic which is also less interesting, is still real good and I managed to give a couple more songs I think I will grow to love. I also allowed Anime "KoiKimo" theme song... digital singles to enter my life because despite <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/linaria/1558379659?i=1558379660&amp;l=en" target="_blank">MaRuRi and Ryuga's new song</a></b> and <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/monoqlo-city/1559471662?i=1559471666&amp;l=en" target="_blank">ACE COLLECTION's new song</a></b> sounding real good but of course I prefer the former, they aren't announcing any larger releases related to it and I guess it's a trend like this now so I will not wait any longer to give them in like, a couple more months later where they announce their new album or whatever. *laughs* Oh, didn't I mention to listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/the-temple/1557677244?i=1557677381&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Rie fu's new song</a>(s)</b>? Yeah. That's it. *laughs* Oh also, <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/gudafuwa-everyday-ep/1556000069?l=en" target="_blank">Yuuki Aoi's new single</a></b>. Period. *laughs* Yay to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/spyair-applemusicjp/pl.u-8aAVokVsm68kp4B?l=en" target="_blank">SPYAIR being the new Collection Artist</a></b> with their new album this week by the way!! It has been a while but here you go some Klassic Note recognition</div>  <br />  On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and I just recalled this paragraph's opening unlike last week, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1380085797328547844?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's music video preview</a></b> on YouTube is actually good so I guess I'll be listening to it anyways and if you can't wait I haven't listened to <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1379733688645079040?s=20" target="_blank">the full song</a> so you're welcome, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/toysfactory/status/1380445383239811075?s=20" target="_blank">Komatsu Mikako's preview of her new song</a></b>&nbsp;(they call it "spot CM", as in "commercial", for commercial use) I wouldn't even call a music video preview is even shorter, and I think we might have a Klassic Note Review next month hehe (yes I'm just a fan lol) (of her in person haha), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/vividundress/status/1380687077138821120?s=20" target="_blank">vivid undress' new mini-album is in end of June</a></b> so that's why you wait to listen to their digital singles back in March, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Aimer_and_staff/status/1379421210786721800?s=20" target="_blank">Aimer's new music video</a></b> is fine I guess I'll make the final verdict soon, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/taka8rie/status/1379086425920970754?s=20" target="_blank">Takahashi Rie's solo debut song</a></b>&nbsp;released early along with the drama premier is... uh not what I expected because seriously why you didn't go the usual Anime level route,&nbsp;<br />  <br />  Well, looks like for next week we have to give obligatory Klassic Note artist <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/walpurgis/1546316228?l=en" target="_blank">Aimer's new album</a></b> a listen then. *giggles* It has been a while since I gave her anything since last year, so this will be a good time to get back on her songs, provided if it will even appear in Apple Music in the first place. Well, I haven't seen <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/torches-ep/1538261363?l=en" target="_blank">her newer songs</a> on that music subscription platform I just renewed for the 7th time coming so go figure.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  Well, another week's over again. Feel a week older yet? *laughs* I know, I'm boring. On the other hand, I should be more interested in the things around me, I guess. Or not. Or maybe I always talk too much when people have to ask me something at work. Yeah. Remind myself to keep quiet again when I feel the urge to talk lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... You know how sad I was when I saw those Kayano Ai bromides disappear from my cart (which I haven't clicked on order... yet) on that Suruga-ya site?? Haha yes, I held back already, and have been doing so for like a month already. That's what happens when you want to review a photobook and you have no reason to haha. On other things, Douki-chan got another volume, so we got something to talk about again next month, along with Akarin's fanclub goods and Inorin's fanclub goods. Fanclub goods are the topic then, I guess. Should I respect the rule of three and add like, Rika-sama into the mix? Well, her blog's header images are already my fuel so I'm good. *laughs* Okay bye<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Me, remind yourself to go find out whether nano.RIPE is hyping up their old songs or promoting their new songs which you haven't given a listen to yet and listen to them.</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. Wow, didn't even realise until <a href="https://twitter.com/Ayana_take/status/1381211663244791819?s=20" target="_blank">she showed an image of herself on Twitter</a> (lol) that Taketatsu Ayana has been singing solo for 9 years since 2012! Congrats man. Can't wait to burn my money on your best album next year lol *looks at Kana-chan's 2012 debut*</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
