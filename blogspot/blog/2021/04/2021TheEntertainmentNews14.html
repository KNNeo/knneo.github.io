<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jeYVslaP-8I/YGmsti9dgkI/AAAAAAABDeU/h9geNrwWSZopQauNjzuyWnWlYbe2U66OQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya13_hori2.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>Man, I will say this as many times as I like, four-day work weeks are GREAT haha this is what those big tech companies refer to as the 80-20 work balance lol not like I did much of my own stuff though (oh, lazy me)<div><br /></div><div>  On other things because when you have a long weekend you will have itchy fingers to sign up for more   fanclubs, I signed up for <a href="https://kitoakari-fc.com/" target="_blank">Akarin's</a>. *giggles* I'll do it just for the goods though   to pair up with Inorin because this one just opened for like a month only so I won't expect loads of online content, and this one isn't on a yearly subscription so we'll   be done in four weeks once we get the bromides lol okay maybe six they will gift something for first 3, 6 and recursive 12 months hehe</div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe that's how I'm going to gauge whether to join fanclubs or not. They gotta sell bromides or calendars lmao</div><div><br /></div><div>  New month, new season of Anime, new shows to watch! How can I move on so much   and forget everything behind me- I'm starting to sound like a Miyamura lmao </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo01">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "My brother's hot, he's smart, he's fairly rich... he's a scumbag though"       How I think my sis intro me to her friends lol     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay dude, why you trying to pick up on a JK when you have such a great life banging chicks?   Haha I won't understand. In this initial impression of this romance comedy   series (#KoiKimo01) where Japanese be not flashing their perfect English   because that was actually good so look at the credits for an English name later lmao (uh oh I was wrong!!!), I'm pretty sure this dude Ryo is totally in the wrong.   *laughs* How DARE you force me to side with a schoolgirl lmao. So, story. They   laid it out before they started the opening, so this will be easy to get into. I   mean, it's called "when it's called love it's disgusting" so you know this is   going to be their joke. Think "Blend.S" with Dino and Maika and you'll get the   idea. We start with playboy Ryo who just woke up after sleeping with a woman   whom we will not know the name of because where got time dude, and go straight to   work the next day. Man, is this how   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/riajuu" target="_blank">normies</a> at   that age work nowadays? I can even barely stay awake after work every day you guys can get it on all night lol.   Anyways, he almost fell down a flight of stairs which will give him a week of   hospital leave at least haha not to say ruining his handsome face, if not for nearby high schooler Ichika who   technically saved his life. It's rather cheap to use the "I didn't eat   breakfast" tactic as an excuse, Ichika felt like helping him out so he doesn't end up like this the second time coming, and gave him her   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bento" target="_blank">bento</a> for the   day. Man, I would agree though that if someone did this to me I'll be sending   her flowers every day haha. So, and then they met again at his place because   coincidentally, just, Ichika is also his <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a>'s friend.   Hey, reminds you of a typical porno setting now? *laughs* (Haha where's the part where the guy sees the sister's friend's underwear and then they f-) And then after that   you can explore it yourself as Ryo intrudes very passionately or even to the   extent of rudely into Ichika's life, sending her so many presents to her place so much   so her mother notices, and moreover, coincidentally bumps into her without   much effort so they can interact more maybe thanks to his sister to be honest,   and she is also one of the avenues to Ryo knowing Ichika better in every way   possible. What a gullible girl, this Ichika. *laughs* (Note: She is 17) Hey, what can I say? She   is kind of too-pure-pure-girl, to be honest. Honest, kind, otaku... if you   haven't even watched this episode but just looked at the title image you   would've thought this was <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/35968/Wotaku_ni_Koi_wa_Muzukashii" target="_blank">that other Anime</a>  with a new season lol. Anyways, from Ichika getting Ryo's phone number and asking him to stop sending "one flower" every day (also known as "Ichi-ka"), to going   grocery shopping together, to chatting while "studying" in the   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/famiresu" target="_blank">family restaurant</a>  I suppose... There is so much about Ichika to like, to be frank. But hey, not   that this 30-year-old should be interested though; there's so many of them   women in his office who think he's cool. But just like the sister mentioned,   he's kind of a scumbag, and it couldn't have been described better. He's   irritating, he's a masochist which really makes this Dino but worse lol, he's   relentless which great it's kind of important in pursuing in a relationship so   I guess he wins, and he's a master comedian. Because really, if I were to give   this series, I'll be spending half the time doing   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukkomi" target="_blank">tsukkomi</a> of   all the stuff mentioned every episode including this one. Overall so far, I   would think this series can hold up, if it goes on in the right direction. From the trailers I've seen I can be hopeful. The   animation is subpar at best, the premise and relationships between the main   couple of kinda weaker than the one in "Blend.S" which is a bummer, but I can   still see its potential so I will give this the three-episode rule. Also,   Ichika <i>is</i> cute. Good enough reason to give chance. *laughs* Okay Ichika don't shit on me please   <div>    <div>      [TL:DR; Hey yo <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/47814/Yurie_Kozakai" target="_blank">the voice behind Yoshikawa Yuki</a> from "Horimiya" I see you have moved up to       main girl role now haha <i>nice</i>]</div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9Cam1nVG_pQ/YGmpZyw9yxI/AAAAAAABDd0/Qw9N9mw5xAcTy-BWmqEOn-uBdIq8lA_EQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo01_smirk.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Find yourself friends who can help you get laid<br />(lol)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HMZs_V-Jdmk/YGmpaVSj9mI/AAAAAAABDd4/BgBRw2hIrcw83PCRv-W-22uvFSaSmN3_gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo01_ichika4.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            Find yourself a partner who is not as smart as you are haha<br />(Sorry             Ichika)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>      P.S.

"He's so cool!" *whispers* <i>HE'S INTO HIGH SCHOOLERS!!!</i> Haha     </div>    <div>      <br />      <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Horimiya13">        <div style="text-align: center;">          <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Horimiya</span>        </div>      </blockquote>      <blockquote class="tr_bq">        <div style="text-align: center;">          "She eats a lot, moves a lot, and sleeps a lot. Hori-san is           interesting" Haha that's what I say of all women lol (Hey loner me we           have to talk)         </div>      </blockquote>      I can't believe we have to salute to Iura for his bravery in going against       Hori-san haha he doesn't even know. So many have done it before him and he decides to do it now. So, so brave. *laughs* In this final       episode of this lovely series (#Horimiya13) we do graduation because why       not? Not like we're getting another season of this... oh well. *laughs*       So, story? I don't think this is it, but you know, if you need canon       material go read the manga series. The original, when it was still called       "Hori-san to Miyamura-kun", no joke. So firstly, about graduation. About       how everyone had to bring their stuff back bit by bit so you wouldn't be       like an idiot and drag everything back on the last day they tell you to...       sadly Hori and Iura thought they could get away with hands-free but you       know, they have idiot friends around so *laughs* Sengoku and Yanagi and       the others thought about going on a graduation trip (well it started from Remi-chan) with the lot of them       potentially once Yanagi can get his driving license (and Remi thought       having a license is like a breakup?), Miyamura sneezed during Sengoku's       graduation speech for the students (I will just run out of the hall tbh       lol PANDEMIC JOKE), why is Kyousuke here lmao, and Motoko probably took a       while to find out peppy Iura is his <a href="https://jisho.org/search/oniichan" target="_blank">onii-chan</a>'s       image in school. Too late, girl; It's over. *laughs* Then, we have to       solve Miyamura's identity crisis. Well, mainly because him today is so       different even compared to him in the first episode, let alone say him in middle       school. Hey, remember this just like, happened on the final year of his       high school life so he has effectively lived two years just as you have       seen in the imagination: Alone. He would have still been a loner and a       freak, don't know why Sengoku wouldn't be with Remi-chan but I guess, the       triangle relationship starring Sakura-chan would not have happened (which       might be better for her tbh), and HoriMiya would not have existed. (Title drop) And lastly,       we talk about the main couple. Miyamura then recalls if not for the one       coincidence of him actually having to accompany Souta to his place and the       brother insisting that this cool brother be accompanying him more often...       all these wouldn't have happened. I know, right? If not for MVP Souta...       *laughs* Man, we have come so far into this series I can't even. And as       Miyamura recalls what Hori is in person, I really had wished I had such a       coincidence living into my life thus far, that I had my life changed to       such an extent, even if it had a bad ending. *sob* All in all, I don't       have much to say about this final episode to be honest, just that it's a       decent round-up of what is about Miyamura's complex, and the relationships       in this series in general. It was a ride, and it was a good one. I have no       complaints. For a series which got a new image moving out of the original       and finally getting an Anime adaptation, this could not have been a better       reward than anything else. Probably also why this is the most popular       romance Anime for the season (Winter 2021 season) for its rollercoaster of       emotions in simplicity, if you need a summary. I enjoyed this series, no       joke. Maybe it's just those character rides that kinda suck especially       Miyamura which just reminds me of "Sangatsu no Lion" but hey, not as heavy       and it's necessary anyways, so just like my life I went through with it. *dabs* For this series though, I think it has left an impression to some extent,       it reminds me of romance Anime I have watched, and that is actually a good       thing. I could use more of these shows tbh especially masochist Hori-san       haha okay we're done</div><div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1030" data-original-width="1174" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ywCTt6aelvc/YGmsTPFKI8I/AAAAAAABDeI/rIm_7Q3zBTMZMx4GRwGIY2x7IkWEzLozQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya13_baggage.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            LONG SHOTS TO END THE SERIES!!<br />(When you have more emotional             baggage watching this series compared to these guys lol)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="text-align: center;">            <img border="0" data-original-height="1186" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D9g1VmocRvc/YGmsTIFZ5sI/AAAAAAABDeE/rS-pEf1PTK4aqIZypgZutmuTQ0Wf3NO5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya13_sleep.jpg" width="320" />          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">            LONG SHOTS TO END THE SERIES!!<br />(#RelationshipGoals)           </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table></div>      </div>      P.S.

What did disappoint was still <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/magical-mode/1558994756?i=1558994757&amp;l=en" target="_blank"><b>Hanazawa Kana's new song</b></a> because they think I was a fan of Anime Monogatari series character song "Renai Circulation" because it's totally that so it's sort of rapping which is a no-go for me for sure. I didn't forget about <b>Kana-chan's music library available on streaming services</b> with the same date as this new song though, so <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/hanazawakana-applemusicjp/pl.u-oZylMVWFqAzVk58?l=en" target="_blank">I got that covered</a>. <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/who/1554411339?l=en" target="_blank"><b>Ikimonogakari's new album</b></a> is a meh, maybe because I really got bored of their songs, or that I didn't hear any of those songs I can relate to, say, in terms of their usual style. So yeah, just the topic songs I suppose. <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/unite/1556622311?l=en" target="_blank"><b>SPYAIR's new album</b></a> is winner this week which will no doubt land them as the newest Klassic Note Collection Artist, with topic songs to remember on their usual Rock style which probably already stole the limelight of what is about to happen with SIX LOUNGE next week but hey, I can take more Rock songs because man, have I given A LOT of Pops this year alone. Still haven't decided how many songs from SPYAIR I can give though; It all feels the same I'm trying to choose distinct melodies and/or styles.</div><div>      <br />From news around Twitter regarding music and if you wonder why this post is always late because I wait for news to happen, this is hot off the press so <b><a href="https://twitter.com/inoriminase/status/1378711588903866370?s=20" target="_blank">Minase Inori's new single</a></b> is for Anime and it's out on July so yay more stuff for the fanclub which I am a member of hehe, I really should listen to <b><a href="https://twitter.com/TuneCoreJapan/status/1377949727614935041?s=20" target="_blank">Rie fu's new song(s)</a></b> considering they aren't under her English artist name, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cramer_pr/status/1377928063187443714?s=20" target="_blank">Komatsu Mikako is back with a new single</a></b> for Anime due in May which is exciting for me to be honest (following Taketatsu Ayana and Hanazawa Kana this week), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/uesaka_official/status/1377908664938328065?s=20" target="_blank">Uesaka Sumire's new music video</a></b> is not something to make you nosebleed but it will make you want to date high schooler her and f**k maid her (lmao okay me), <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1377837608756125703?s=20" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES released a live video on YouTube</a></b> commemorating 100 million views for the music video of "Kyouran Hey Kids!!" which is AWESOME, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1377974498138316802?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff is now on bandcamp</a></b> which allows for free streaming of music just that it does not feature the songs from their major label, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/shionnu10/status/1376864814320873475?s=20" target="_blank">Tsuji Shion's new song</a></b> is for a commercial so I expect in full soon, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1376821504688541700?s=20" target="_blank">SHE's new song is for another drama</a></b> again but man are they popular in the drama industry for theme songs, and this is still related but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/alterna_girls/status/1376489312959619078?s=20" target="_blank">mobile game "Alternative Girls" new character song</a></b> for Uesaka Sumire voiced Kiiragi Tsumugi (yes) has more <a href="https://jisho.org/search/nyan" target="_blank">nyan</a> in the preview than any average cat has spoken in their lifetime haha<br />      <br />      So next week, finally, FINALLY!!! *laughs* We have the strongest showdown in Klassic Note for the year: It's <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/music-wardrobe/1557238100?l=en" target="_blank">FIVE NEW OLD's new album</a></b> versus <b>SIX LOUNGE's new album</b>!

Yeah. Twitter in Japan but still. Obviously not because of her Anime roles, nor is it an announcement (of her marriage) or sorts, but she did declare <a href="https://twitter.com/Lynn_0601_/status/1378600675249033222?s=20" target="_blank">she won an actual bet</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/netkeiba/status/1378599320937660416?s=20" target="_blank">a horse match</a> so yeah. *laughs* I don't think her win of ~1mil yen will set her for retirement lol but I did try to understand what it was she won, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Tantalus_uma/status/1378619346205872129?s=20" target="_blank">someone kindly did the calculations</a>. She betted on three horses in one ticket (Note the numbers 1, 7 and 8 on the previous Tweets) in which unsorted is base 1000yen and sorted in rank 6000yen, and she betted the former. The overall winnings were about 1060x her actual bet so... now you know why she was in Trending lmao. If you want to get hold of the money now is the time to court her lol. Cya guys next week then, and until next time... I'm so glad my <a href="https://twitter.com/yoasobi_ABEMA/status/1378345266303037442?s=20" target="_blank">Wednesday night fuel is back</a> again with the duo plus I don't know if I would call myself a fan of married voice actress <a href="https://twitter.com/tokui_sorangley" target="_blank">Tokui Sora</a>, but she is lovely and I've yet to experience her in front of the camera, so let's see how much chaos she can bring into this lot haha. Hey, only chaos, Sora-san. We don't accept compromises here lmao bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. <a href="https://twitter.com/dengekionline/status/1378554435396272132?s=20" target="_blank">Another "Venus"</a> (is what they call the girls) in DOAXVV?? Man, are they just dishing out new girls with the same 3D model lol well they are trying though. TIL also that the Steam version had separate livestream reveals of the same events from the past from the DMM Games version, but in addition, having separate new outfits. Yeah.
