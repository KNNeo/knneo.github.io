Next week you'll have to watch FIVE shows in one Sunday haha maybe I will spread it throughout next week and not on Mondays I need to sleep after work lmao <div><br /></div><div>*sigh*</div><div><br /></div><div>  That's the problem with work now, huh. Me dealing with emails and WhatsApp   group messages on Saturdays? Okay too real let's talk about Anime and Klassic   Note haha ugh </div><div><br /></div><div>  What did I do this weekend so far? Not sleeping? *laughs* Okay apart from   that, probably just playing around with code as if I've not gotten enough at   work *OOF* Let's REALLY not talk about work now haha let's do this and go take   a nap </div><div><br /></div><div>  (Edit: I took a nap just now so Sunday night Anime!! Well it is happening for   the new shows this season but they air at like, half past midnight here so   nope. *laughs*)<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="SonnyBoy12">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Sonny Boy</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "Did our going adrift ever really happen?" </div>  </blockquote>  Wait, graduation? I thought we- Oh. OH!!! *laughs* In this final episode of if   you can figure this series out you can study for PhD lol (#SonnyBoy12), this   series makes you think. How far should we do so though I'll touch on that   later as I summarize this series, but let's talk about the story. Last week,   Nagara and Mizuho attempted the impossible by leaving Hateno Island and that   weird world they were adrift in, and I'll not drop you the details, but   apparently they managed to do it, with the help of the compass. They were   slightly stopped by Asakaze though, who also provided more context on what   happened within the worlds in this universe. Everyone else chose to not leave for they accepted the fate of them and their copies, if you would recall, and   within these parallels to not ruin what is of the present and future, so to   say. However, Mizuho and specifically Nagara believed in Nozomi's wish in   leaving this universe using her powers, and I would say they were just here to   fulfil it, as much as it is also another one of those chances in a gamble they   have been taking to leave this place since Episode 1. But they did it though. Don't let the   cutscenes think that Mizuho and Nagara returned to their respective real life   worlds; The story was laid out not in chronological order. Nagara and Mizuho   got updated on their lives as of graduation day it seems: Nagara was living alone   working on part-time jobs to go by, and Mizuho... let's just say the   grandmother passed away along with the cats. So yeah, real life did progress   without them. Too real, even. Nagara and/or Mizuho thought when they met each   other at the school gate, that they probably are not in the same world, but   thanks to a code they shared with each other before they returned here,   they know they have done it. No really, Mizuho thought she was alone after she   left that world. She&nbsp;looked through everything in school. The curtains   which were supposed foldovers, the toilet which can bring them through worlds...   she checked everything. And yet, it seems that nothing called out to her. This   is as sad as you can think of, especially when looking at Nagara, Nozomi   barely even knew him and only as schoolmates in middle school, and, which is   worse in my opinion, she is hanging out with Asakaze who also do not know of   him. Yep. You feeling sad now? *laughs* (People and animals dying? Me not   hanging out with anyone after school? My girl hanging out with another dude?   Bruh, too real) (Haha) It's as if nothing happened, and it was as if the two went through   like, a joyride of sorts sitting down in a lab chair controlled by the   principal or whoever is the cause of this or maybe they had too much weed or   something. *laughs* So, sorry to be abrupt like what this might actually be about,   let's talk about what this whole series is instead. As I mentioned a couple of times throughout the   series, I think this series really is about growing up, as Nagara said,   letting you think about changing the world. Of course it's not as easy as it   seems since we don't have superpowers here to duplicate anything using cats or travel to Japan to meet some AV idols so I can f**k them in this universe...   *laughs* But yeah, you get the idea. It just makes you think. Think about what   you would have done in a different situation where you can be in control.   Mizuho and Nagara both have walked out of their comfort zones because they   knew of their powers and think they can change the world. It obviously seems   more bleak with societal rules and a limited lifespan lol, but suffice it to   say <b>this series is meant to make you think</b>. And I'll not take that   freedom away from me. Ever. And I think that is good enough for this series in which producer and director Natsume Shingo is trying to convey. He is going to   have an event soon which will explain the overall lore of this series, but I   think I don't have to know about that. Being a surreal series in itself, some   things are better understood if you think about it yourself, and that's where   it matters. I would say it's not for the average joe because someone would've   banged their head against the wall to check if they are adrift lol, but yeah,   this series is hard to digest, and in a very specific way. Whether I would   think this will win all the other shows I watch at the end of this season? I   doubt so. What it will do though, is make you think. And for that, I'm glad I   took on this wild journey of overestimated production budget and total lack of   common sense in storytelling. </div><div>  [TL:DR; To quote from Mizuho which will still make you think: "As long as you   have some memories of that world, you will be fine."] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JZJNthZ8md0/YVmzgBcSunI/AAAAAAABIOo/OaM-SdVwKDYtYWa376QrLdy_xcZkQFCeACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/sonnyboy12_love.gif" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Moments that made me think<br />(OOF this is just sad to watch   it's literally me as Nagara)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-es6HazOVGks/YVm0maiyJzI/AAAAAAABIOw/i-cQV-G7SIUN8s4x6ivZoxTrcFPlmCsVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sonnyboy12_couple1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Moments that made me think<br />(Hey, glad to see Yamabiko and Kodama were   friends irl)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OThUGTV3_Ys/YVm0naF0l0I/AAAAAAABIO0/u18PWAXUwoARx0HkW3HyrPE0_1HAB_iBwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sonnyboy12_voice2.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      Moments that made me think<br />(Is this a euphemism for parents   unable to convince kids to not do otherwise?)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

You know   they put such a strong backing on this just because they want you to THINK   (get it?) how you imagine this series as... right? *taps brain meme* Mine is   that one where   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/let-there-be-light-again/1582740135?i=1582740142&amp;l=en" target="_blank">they travelled worlds using Nagara</a>  after I heard how bad the one where   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/summer-storm/1582740135?i=1582740139&amp;l=en" target="_blank">they released the curtains</a>  was] </div><div>  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>音楽</b></span>  <span style="font-size: large;">This Week on Klassic Note</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  This week we have some releases to talk about because my hands got itchy and   went to find new songs so *laughs* Anyways, let's start with actual stuff   released this week.   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/moonlight-magic-ep/1583734597?l=en" target="_blank">Hanazawa Kana's new single</a></b>  since her marriage and her moving music labels isn't exactly impressive, with   technically two songs because the other two were Chinese versions (yep) so I   will never consider them in Klassic Note anyways, did not do very well either   just because the songs aren't that great either.   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/still-still-stellar/1585332601?l=en" target="_blank">Hoshimachi Suisei's 1st album</a></b>  definitely did better though, as I continue to give her songs despite the very   style which will deter me if you ask me five years ago, and I'm just giving   them here and there. Definitely trying to avoid the overly pop styles though,   really trying there. Because of my itchy hand hitting on YouTube videos   because I kinda want more and avoiding those I have heard of them, I ended up   giving   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/boring-thing-ep/1445989932?l=en" target="_blank"><b>No Buses' 1st EP</b></a>  from 2018 a chance with their two songs with music videos in my list now   because I can't stop dancing to poorly sung English songs lol. Thanks to Gotch   recommending stuff on Twitter again, I took in some hardcore Rock music with   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/capy-love-massacre-single/1570587180?l=en" target="_blank">Sister In The Velvet's single from July</a></b>  which really isn't that bad, and made me remember how much I rather give this   than Kana-chan and Sui-chan. *laughs* Problem is I did give the whole single,   but there's only a vinyl release apart from digital. So... yeah. No CD?   *giggles* Thanks to one Kohara Konomi's suggestion for songs through her   Instagram stories, I gave   <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/jukebox-driver/1583690240?i=1583690241&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Penthouse's new song</a></b>  a chance (and I'll link to their Twitter because they are hard to search   online because of their name) which is like R&amp;B and very like Awesome City   Club so chances of me giving anything else other than this is very slim. Great   recommendation though, Koko-chan, considering these guys are rather new to the   industry. </div><div>  <br />  On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and soon I may not have to   translate the posts since they just keep doing it themselves,   <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi_info/status/1443863259774439435?s=20" target="_blank"><b>yanaginagi is asking for your favourite song</b></a>  for her 10th anniversary of solo music career and yes   <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1443892062420537346?s=20" target="_blank">I did Tweet about it</a>  even though I know that'll never hit the polls that'll be made in the near   future, there's   <a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1443531075561697287?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Natsukawa Shiina's live video</b></a>  on YouTube of her recent live,   <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1443395655280443399?s=20" target="_blank"><b>Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song</b></a>  is for a car commercial,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1443201607143878662?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari sang their new song in THE FIRST TAKE</a></b>  and yes it is a new song since their buddy left the two to take on music   alone,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/nanoripe_info/status/1442084663124639744?s=20" target="_blank">nano.RIPE is releasing a digital single in November</a></b>  following the announcement of their 11th anniversary in their special acoustic   live on YouTube which I did miss but I did listen I only know of one song   anyways, and last but not least because this is 2021 and I'm not joking   anymore,   <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1443912188654096387?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail's members have their solo music Twitter accounts now</a></b>  with the vague promise of their Tweets once in a while so we shall see. So   that is   <a href="https://twitter.com/Amamiyastaff/status/1443880668849573888?s=20" target="_blank">Amamiya Sora's Twitter account</a>  which got transformed from that account which started last year if you can   remember,   <a href="https://twitter.com/Asakura_Staff/status/1443878364725628940?s=20" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's Twitter</a>  account along with   <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1443878606112018473?s=20" target="_blank">Natsukawa Shiina's Twitter account</a>  which are both newly added. Instagram when, MusicRay'n? *giggles* I followed   all of them btw just so you know.<br />  <br />So for next week, and really finally I must say I've been waiting for   these for a while, <b>SHE'S new album</b> is going to be a treat out of all   these really, really boring pop styles haha, and let's see if I can give   anything from <b>Game "Alternative Girls" Memorial Collection</b> Album- Am I   really saying all this? *sob* Oh well, might as well enjoy this and the game   until it stops end of the month.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  You have no idea how much I want that package right now. I have waited too   long for it, I'm so burnt out from work, I spent so much money just earlier this   week on especially Ookubo Rumi bromides which goddamn you only see those once   in a decade so I'm glad I got it hehe, but yes, even the ones mentioned weeks   ago have yet to leave Japan. Yeah, so that's a problem. Let's hope I can send   it out within next week or I may have to pay more shipping to ship them   separately haha. Cya guys next time then, and until then... man, I need to   take work leave at some point. *laughs* Work sucks. *laughs* Haha I better   start applying lest it be rejected due to "obligations" lol bye<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>P.S.
