Probably also because passive work ripples just surface after Friday is over? Ugh, maybe it's time haha <div><br /></div><div>  I said to do this separately on another day probably yesterday, but looks like   we're going for the binge and watching all the shows today, so yay there goes   my Sunday afternoon lol. Then again, I spent a lot of money yesterday thanks   to mom wanting a new laptop so this is a good way to forget about the big hole   on my digital wallet lol </div><div><br /></div><div>  Life update over, let's talk about animation and music instead! New season,   new line-up of shows, problem is I CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE ALL FIVE!!! <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   Uh... we shall see about that haha if you need an initial prediction I might   only be giving 3 of the ones I'll be testing out this week. Let's see if that   is true. </div><div>  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="MierukoChan01">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;">        <a href="https://jisho.org/search/mieru" target="_blank">Mieru</a>ko-chan</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span style="text-align: left;">"How did you know it was me (Hana)?" It's... pretty... distinctive haha         I like how Miko-chan here says "bounciness" lol not wrong it's a         one-of-a-kind experience</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  Man, what is with the intro anyways. They just spook you with a spook story which is likely just a circuit breaker fallout? And then the door opens- HAHA HOW DID I   PREDICT THAT lol. Anyways, in this series where if you got spooked you need to   stop right now haha (#MierukoChan01), it isn't as bad as I thought. In the   preview a couple of weeks ago I talked about how this series will deter me if   it's scary or boring, and surprisingly it's neither of them. Well, there is   still some element of both though, I'm thinking on how to proceed ahead, so   let me talk it out. For starters, it's not scary. It's maybe spooky like how   you just hear people talk about a shitty horror story in that Halloween   stayover, but otherwise due to the fact that the ghosts appear rather subtle   and not like giving you jump scares that will probably freak the girls in the   series more than us so, I'm glad it's not that extent. Still, they are leaving   that element of suspense in though, so don't expect real-life explanations of   such paranormal stuff compared to our world right here. What I'm more   concerned for now, is the story. I thought we'll jump right in with how   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/miko" target="_blank">Miko</a>-chan our dear   main girl here will not be scared of ghosts right from the bat (her name is literally the bane of existence for ghosts dude), so then it'll   just be a slice-of-life, but yeah that doesn't sound great without much   context on how it started, so here's Mieruko-chan the origin story I guess. We explore her   discovery of ghosts probably due to interactions of ghosts or attempts of   them, on unknowing people. People like the one in the intro will be most of   their reactions, but for Miko-chan here... she chooses to ignore them. Still   freaked out though to the extent of quivering <span title="*wink*">üòâ</span>, but yeah, that'll   probably get more of the bros around her so bad choice, girl. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> What   this series will compensate for the obscure genres here though, is fanservice.   The episode itself is just littered with reminders that Miko-chan has a friend   with a huge rack and a big appetite so think of the ghost that appeared out of   the fridge in the intro lmao, and someone else who they bumped into which will   no doubt be another of those people who can see ghosts, but we'll leave that   for the lore in the future should we get into this. But yeah, from Miko-chan lifting   up(?) and squeezing rainwater off her skirt, to obvious panty lines when she   bends over, to her friend's squishy boobs... that's every other&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/ecchi" target="_blank">ecchi</a>  reference they can put into a high school setting right and locked. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   Which... hmm I don't know if that'll do this series any good, but I must say   though, if I'm that depraved (and I am though? so) (haha ah-) I can watch this   and then get spooked every week lmao. All in all, I must say this series   piques me. And I must say that would be enough for me to watch this every   week. I fear not for the ghosts though, but more for the lore behind, as I   didn't know much when I saw the preview, and I still don't know anything even till now. "Hanako-kun" had a pretty bad run talking about whatever alternate world   bullsh*t, and I don't think this will reach that level anytime soon, but I   don't want it to be when I realized it's too late. So I'll think on it. <span title="*silence*">üòê</span> Three   episode rule again. And if I can still give straight out Miko-chan freaking   out over a rather stale storytelling... and you see the thing is she'll get   used to it, so that will only get more boring over time. Which is why I say haha so   yeah we shall see how this goes </div><div>  [TL:DR; I'll quote this from the next episode preview: "Even if you're   thinking 'I do not want to watch this' I hope you will watch next episode"   Haha NO <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEir8cRyLtruV776tjyOw0QM2lo7IwlZAUa5_ckmQfrfcTPxmKhNCs-9-UFFWaf46spUQD5swSryCwCoE3pGN_mbsw_47nfC3iJWeL-GMf-IfIL4wWyKyfADhiFuEGT-7ZHAHACYHc9Nl5hqtqZ0g8RAFtVBIYJ5I_wuD-HIbcvwTFHT1oRxBXK69kP4=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I like how this is how girls react when we meet for the first time               haha<br />(No, really)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjBkB9ry84CeITdLYFZPhm4pnulLaW4k6bdBfvHWww8-zVWAhfbqRUBY92W2pK9ok8DyvQnH2sk5wr7sOtQ0-5UB6W2E_4jHAPgmIJiyMvh3ztHtW8rZ5KhxlEHufMnPq9OKxSOPDrAPtQ_8DtMdJN4sH5OQeUvukHdqIKGmue36QhRzqSC2YU3hY0p=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I like how this is how girls react when I'm just clouding over               them lol<br />(Did you even see her quiver?

Well, Ten-chan mainly so you're welcome. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (Yes, this is enough haha) (I'm starting to feel bad for her now ah hey I didn't do this to her but I did bookmark that Tweet lmao)]</div><div>  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="TeslaNote01">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>„Ç¢„Éã„É°</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Tesla Note</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. -Albert Einstein" Yeah       with the ghosts I saw in that Anime just now? I'm sweating out of my crotch       man lmao     </div>  </blockquote>  Haha okay Botan-chan you don't have to tell us that you have no friends, we   know. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> In this action series where we literally just talk about   portals in case you don't know what those were (#TeslaNote01), I'm glad I   didn't get a Science degree to like this lore because everything else BESIDES   the lore is disappointing me so far. For context, that is because I knew of   the main girl's voice behind ie. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/43279/Konomi_Kohara" target="_blank">Kohara Konomi</a> tweeting about this series and   me having read a chapter of the manga which is basically this episode alone,   and even not thinking about what lies ahead, I'm already not feeling it. Let's   talk about what is good about it though. Firstly, character development. With   the main guy having to doubt and quibble over the newbie girl who has trained   all her life so far to be a ninja, the two have to work as secret agents under   a private organization to do the Tesla thing which I will not bore you about,   but suffice it to say this kind of throwing of insults is a good combination   for any action series, and you cannot ask for more, see every other action series haha. Add in a humble boss and a   nerd hacker at the back, and you can see how much this team will take off in   various situations. Then, the soundtrack. With Lantis on the helm for theme   songs I'm hardly ever worried about the songs, but you know, pretty much what   I will be b*tching about next is that the genres don't stick with me, and I think the   opening song is something I might actually check out in my own free time haha.   Pace of storytelling and cliff hangers are alright I can't really talk about   much since it really depends on adaptation, but as stated at the front there's   just one thing that'll bug me throughout if I ever pick this up: the   animation. To keep things simple, I've seen RWBY which is purely made from   like, Adobe animation software and it's not known to be awesome in early seasons but this is   literally that. So, as you may have not known, 3DCG is known to lack in   emotive expression with the compensation of fluidity in animation and   supposedly, reduced development of animated drawings. That, is a problem in   itself. What really makes this bad though, is it being an action series which   I mentioned when I talked about "Shinigami Bocchan" last season, but also, the   mix of this with actual animated drawings. This is where the deal breaker is.   I can forgive fluidity in animation but you cannot give me this blend. This is   not coffee and milk you can't just do this. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all, I think I've made   my point, I worry about my sanity if I have to keep up with this animation for   my eyes for three months, so like how a portal is suddenly appearing in front   of me, I'm bailing out. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also, recovering crystal fragments isn't   exactly fun when   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/46471/Tantei_wa_Mou_Shindeiru" target="_blank">taking down an android organization</a>  had a better plot which I also hesitated to give last season so...   Thanks Botan-chan, I'll miss you being cute, your smile and you being wet.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjClwkcUNhr6Q33ECPFJ4DSauTTQT1WerzjStBJ7OLuhBab2kW1nyJ5XscFvaCd822LwWchilxoj8UZl3THUDF0KR7eJU6XfohEgs0CCSIf6121N4_znUlGOr3FHelaZdkMFVKth_vgx6JieW71QQJ4OHk_jTcLnS-0jB9ZLsA0t06b8tTfTP0HcBj7=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I think this is a good sample size to show how bad the animation               blend is<br />(The frame rates on the left and right are slightly               different and it irks me)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh4MgBs3GbCLRT5Qw47jANf--e9LGxZ4hxMuRF_brR4Yrgbq8iiLz_LKjsfS8btPn2d6KxkXxHfm1ZEbLXSpcfFmDqq-MHSNjYRlf3p_HPYoiO_OQR3Y4ovjD-LZ-GWZHNoRydGowVncH-o218rEHMUzB2irnQ4IE5MACE5TpBAXf5kitz10IJf3JcN=s320" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              I think this is a good sample size to show how bad the animation               blend is<br />(They rendered the minor character in 2D <span title="*pukes*">ü§Æ</span>)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Well she can, she will have a beautiful voice just like the appearance   she has, just that, she can't communicate for sh*t. To put this into   perspective, Komi-san being able to speak a proper sentence even if it's "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/hai" target="_blank">yes</a>" is still lesser than how far I can pull down my foreskin- Okay bad analogy.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> See, this is what is with main guy Hitohito (lol the name) who just   screws up his words in life without getting friends let alone getting laid   which is pretty much my life just that I'm not as bad as him tbh so who is   going to save me now. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Still, Hitohito here goes along his life   smoothly, or as smoothly as it gets, until he realized just how lucky and/or   inferior is his life compared to Komi-san, which besides stating that this is   a prestigious school and this dude got in with my level of luck which is the only   thing I have now haha, is probably a zircon compared to this shining gem in   class. Everyone is mesmerized by the girl, and the extent of admiration from   the class even including the teachers is very borderline illegal lol what is   with the camera view. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> But somehow, somehow, everything also works   well for Komi-san. Because if she was in <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31646/3-gatsu_no_Lion" target="_blank">another Anime world</a> she would've been   sh*t on by a lot of b*tch classmates or schoolmates for being high ego and   stuff, so she should consider herself real lucky. However, this is where the   combination is formed. Hitohito is also the only guy in the room who noticed   that Komi-san has that   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/komyusho" target="_blank">communication bug</a>  going on for her. It's so bad we have to watch a blackboard of text (yep,   Japan still uses that) of them conversing instead of just opening your goddamn   mouths- Just exchange LINE numbers already. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> I know this can lead to   misunderstanding and possibly get Hitohito into trouble with the local   gangsters lmao, but at least you don't have to use half the box of chalks to   explain your backstory lol. The production did nail it with heart warming   music which I didn't expect I'll need but yeah, they did everything right in   this series. The author literally just had to shut the girl's mouth up.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> (Okay misogynist me when will you leave) All in all, this series will be as sad as it's going to be awesome   because man if this was real life someone is already going to see a   psychiatrist and none of this would've happened. So yep, be glad this is   Anime. Also, it's adapted in drama already and it's airing earlier than this, so you can   see how this is taking off already, the adaptations for this. (It's not any better, the silence goes on longer in drama lol why) We are, however,   given more into the story to make sure this goal of Komi-san's won't be done   in like, next episode because remember what I mentioned about a prestigious   school? Yeah, they take character in school VERY SERIOUSLY. Hitohito wouldn't   mind since it's a joke to him and it's likely he'll just get shit on   throughout his high school life. Komi-san though... with her main goal in   mind... this is going to be rough. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And that's enough for me to like   this series already. Adding on titular comedic timing moments (eg. Komi-san's   introduction in class lmao, the ending where the teacher just tells the class   to read silently), great theme songs to follow which I have never worried of   the opening with Cider Girl on hand they make great romance songs (Edit:   Leading up to 4th album? Oh they got me real good here haha), and everything   else about it is falling into place quite well. Great animation, by the way,   really reminds me of Dragonball times lol and I don't even watch those haha </div><div>  [TL:DR;   <strike>You think Komi-san should start a blog like me? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And heck, I can     open my mouth and talk lol yeah it'll be about cats <span title="*giggles*">ü§≠</span></strike>&nbsp;OH BOY, CAN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY KOMI-SAN STARTS TO SPEAK IN COMPLETE   SENTENCES lol if you're here for that I'm afraid to disappoint you but unless   we do three seasons of this? <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Also someone please get Komi-san a social media account, please] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjJJRtR3x3F8AGuR27CS4-9mjHaB1ojKBEoMFs1tpj32vY9TGXAaTfp5eD6UoU9UXDcVmjnJMdE5ROOhQKJT2uyovCgIF5ogMEuCK59GZzA57VanUVZZfmXjzZ9hATIpHbDEPZFxRSkY43GCThCxMWjOUDKanumvyZzjvTMjXcbAPIUhiNIg6hRPM2-" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              How I imagine girls react when I talk to them lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhv16N9KL1-a7H41E3Hzrjf6iIeq4-a2ELWMkWujuYlHTwl0_0XOdASDNbqkGHin1c8CBo3bAsa6hDS2GshAyXz4uYgTohAhyeMSPQ-bSBiBl4r7NQvOIyQIve26w4B2zB3bCAK6ebaj7XHzutRuBsOWVH3RCpJ3ZoNWiJXgaXsu8fZUNHEgQgCw-xG" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              It's so, so bright<br />(Haha)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

And we know especially in the   Anime world, that you DO NOT say no to opportunities like this haha let's talk   about why. Firstly, about the dude. Since we're unlikely to refer to that   family of jerks lol, Tamahiko here is technically an abandoned rich kid in the   Taishou Era, a time where royalty and societal hierarchy are still a thing, and   we can still sell your daughter as a bride to the rich guy because you landed   in debt. That, be glad Tamahiko is here to be the receiver of this, because   despite all the stuff that he experienced in an accident losing his mother and   his right arm's use (it's still there but disabled) and being utterly   discriminated by the whole family lol even the servants spit on him I bet, he is REAL   lucky to have, in front of his eyes, a bride of the best kind given to him.   Yes, and I meant in the Anime context no one wants a cute wife in real life.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Of course, initially it's awkward because apart from the production   having to explain how much of a&nbsp;<a href="https://jisho.org/search/peshimisuto" target="_blank">pessimist</a> this dude is here (lol English is a thing in   the 1920s?) (well they had school so I suppose so) (God my Japan history   knowledge is pathetic haha), they also refrained from talking about   bride-to-be Yuzuki's side of the story. Because if you thought Tamahiko is the   guy to pity here, Yuzuki had to leave her house probably due to useless   parents who either can't make a living enough to support themselves OR likely   gambling problems leaving the daughter with no choice but to be used as trade.   <span title="*sigh*">üò©</span> Anyways, Tamahiko is right, why send such a perfect wife to him who is   waiting to die by the day- Happy New Year anyways looking forward to a great   1922 lol (really reminds you about life a century later, huh) (welp) (haha),   but as time passes, we learnt a lot about how Yuzuki feels about having to   deal with a dude for the rest of her life considering she never gets control   over her life in the first place. And yeah, instead of being a pessimist, she   chose to be optimistic. Doing her best is her specialty, and she's just happy   that she didn't end up with for example, a rapist or someone who will torture her to no end, and that he's actually a nice guy. Well, in formalities is more   than enough though, I have that too lol. But still, that is actually good   enough reason to be together. This sounds like a lot of deja vu because yes, it's   once again two people in unforeseen circumstances coming together and helping   out each other in life. As I said, basically that Anime I watched last season   haha. All in all... I wonder if this series will touch on more lore than I   think, because if it does and it's real dark it'll only make this series real   bad in my opinion, especially if things aren't going as rosy as what we have   seen this episode which I must say, is already real nice considering the dad's   a literal jerk haha. I really can't imagine what will be ahead of us,   for if it's not great and they talk about their pasts especially on Tamahiko's side   things might get real sad, and I don't want that. "Shinigami Bocchan" didn't   do that much so it's fine but I don't want this to be worse. For now, I'll definitely give   this a thumbs up, congrats&nbsp;GARNiDELiA for joining Klassic Note sorry for   rejecting your song for TrySail lmao they are in charge of the opening song,   and I wonder what Yuzuki's 2nd worry is. I guess we'll stay around to find   out. There's nowhere else to go already there's only two of us in the   mountains tbh MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA haha okay cya guys next week </div><div>  [TL:DR; I like how this series is as simple as "Shinigami Bocchan", for   Tamahiko is the same: All he needs is love. He lost that along with the   mother, and now he's going to get it back.] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEinctX5dT135bZIXVaYWRsMNCyMORrmu6lsEaxJXHiOIPtR4su5fDkKJGMkClYIeM2rmpf3a5UNdKj62mcKPbG22ZTlah5W7aEzlA73VwLLXJs5oxyouaejTf2OlPYxoA1nfs5osyoIPtdvPkh35IkHEeD15LrUJKJ3rHjKCNTKzMJcYm5uMFhHRiY0" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Wait OMG I actually want this someone disable my right hand and               buy me a bride please<br />(Haha)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgJvLbzhH7A3fiB1YLEonP3Bcdp3Lggo4EVjA0h4TuaB0T2Ae7SV2tWsddTNB_x7Q_6f26w9n9vj6RDQCgWahV97i2ZHjRI4GpQz4P46xdcYAXtHoH0snch-jhEm9d2qi6M1i9AhF94aAkie_XRbYFw-TUIoVku1HWrPJrr8of2omjEV5_5QqvDPxIz" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Cringe GIF incoming lol<br />(<span title="*sigh*">üò©</span>)             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Yep shoutout to all dudes out   there, this is one thing you'll learn to do when you have a girlfriend haha in   this new series about work but we know that's not the focus <span title="*wink*">üòâ</span>   (#SenpaiGaUzai01) we shall learn what it means to be childish as an adult. Or   what society thinks of you as a grown-up who still likes stuff kids want, like   VTubers. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> So, as you may have seen, this series is basically a work   life slice-of-life romance maybe comedy series surrounding salesperson Futaba   who, despite having some work experience in the company where she works, is   still being treated as a kid by her senior Takeda. That is not wrong though,   as we can see from Futaba's room, to her taste in toys lol and pretending to like coffee... Well,   it also fits Futaba to a tee too so yeah Takeda wins every time by the way   just so you know. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> And it's probably also this that Takeda treats her   this way, as like his kid or something and not like he's married I don't   think, but it makes you wonder. Haha moving on, and that's where it really   starts. We are given an everyday scenario of their work life, doing   presentations haha cringe (if you win this contract Futaba you'll get all the   head pettings that you want- Ah. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>), screwing stuff up due to a rushed   schedule which is just typical in any work life to be honest, and then making   things up at the end. Of course, with Takeda's experience and help even if it   means grinding work overnight but hey, as my current boss also said during any   crisis: There is no point in dwelling on mistakes; They have to be fixed   anyways. So yeah, if you worked enough like me you'll understand this, and let   this be a good reminder to all the newbies out there, just in case. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   And that might just be it all around for the first episode. We know of Sakurai who maybe likes   Kazama who likes to prank the heck out of Futaba lol, and Tsukishiro who   drinks alcohol in the morning. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> We should expect more characters   incoming, but as we can see, slice-of-life Anime typically require a cast of   characters each with their own unique traits *looks at Komi-san* so that we   can have some spicy drama going on between them, and I'll look forward to   that. We are also hinted a bit of romance from Futaba I guess, so... sorry I'm   not a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/lolicon" target="_blank">lolicon</a>.   <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> All in all... honestly speaking, I don't know what MORE to expect of   this series. They got everything right already, from story to production   behind... they did it better than how Futaba did in her presentation. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span>   But this is also the most worrying part if I were to give this series, because   apart from being too real it makes me cry lol, this potentially has a lot more   lore similar to say, the "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6956/Working" target="_blank">WORKING!!</a>" series in terms of relationships and slice-of-life stuff that is to look   forward to, but somehow, I don't think that's enough. Maybe it's my lack of   enthusiasm for the main couple, but I don't know. I guess I'll watch a couple   of episodes after all, to see what else is in store besides Sakurai and   Kazama. Then maybe, maybe then, I'll sign the contract.

I don't know, I'm still feeling burnt out but you know, I'll still try to give a couple of songs here and there. I did listen to <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/howl-at-the-moon-single/1587268634?l=en" target="_blank">yorushika's new song</a></b> but I didn't care so I'll not comment more on that. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/alternative-girls-best-memorial-collection/1587300708?l=en" target="_blank">Mobile game "Alternative Girls" memorial best album</a></b> is nothing short of surprises, as I give new songs I didn't expect to do good and vice versa, so yeah, there have been a lot of hesitation going on for the latter part to be honest. Still, I have talked about it at length in <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1445761980099219459?s=20" target="_blank">the Twitter moment I created</a> so be sure to check out how much time I spent at work to do this. *sshh* But of course, we know <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/amulet/1582553731?l=en" target="_blank">SHE'S new album</a></b> is the highlight, so apart from the topic song for the album which ended up disappointing compared to the other new songs in the release, I realized I ended up giving more or less the same stuff compared to their previous albums: The topic song with a music video, something not in their usual style, and a familiar melody, to date. Yeah, I'm totally into their styles now and might as well because they also got their place in <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/shes-applemusicjp/pl.u-GgA52mmsxkNM50J?l=en" target="_blank">Klassic Note Collections</a> so congrats too I don't know if there is any significance for you guys but it will for me. <span title="*thumbs up*">üëç</span></div><br />On news concerning music and it's on Twitter and if you want to know everything you can check out <a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/likes" target="_blank">my liked Tweets</a>, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/scandal_band/status/1445403884902658053?s=20" target="_blank">SCANDAL's new music video</a></b> is still not my thing even if I listened to it again, we finally have confirmation of <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lantis_staff/status/1445720492279689221?s=20" target="_blank">ChouCho's best album</a></b> which will include new songs so I'll listen to them when it's out in December, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/The_FirstTake/status/1446083027373682693?s=20" target="_blank">SPYAIR was on THE FIRST TAKE</a></b> now but not featuring a song I like so we know there will be a second time so I'll wait for that, we know <b><a href="https://twitter.com/kusoiinkai/status/1446357044362027012?s=20" target="_blank">Kuso Iinkai's new album recording</a></b> is going well so here's hoping it's actually good, this is the best news yet because <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1446445323350462466?s=20" target="_blank">cinema staff's new album will be out in November</a></b> which is soon and I can't wait to listen to it considering <a href="https://twitter.com/cinemastaff_/status/1446450559733538816?s=20" target="_blank">the album trailer</a> is DOPE, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1446445772002586626?s=20" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES will premiere their new music video</a></b> next week so stay tuned I guess, I totally missed <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1446716228874096643?s=20" target="_blank">SHE'S livestream yesterday on YouTube</a></b> even though they have given us a head start by revealing music video and documentaries to remind us that there's an <a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1446819470559756300?s=20" target="_blank">acoustic live</a> to wrap the evening but I guess I rather watch something else lol, and last but not least since I am likely giving Anime "Komi-san" its opening theme credit <b><a href="https://twitter.com/cidergirl_info/status/1443863556240273412?s=20" target="_blank">Cider Girl's new album will be out in December</a></b> and since I only missed their 2nd album and this is their 4th... why not. Why not, right? I'll be able to give something good in it I literally got jebaited into it because of Anime anyways so <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yoroshikuonegaishimasu" target="_blank">pleased to meet your acquaintance</a> again guys haha</div><div><br />So next week, besides confirming the songs from that "Alternative Girls" memorial... album haha, I'll also be reviewing and man did I screw up that delay weeks ago, <b>Yogee New Waves' new album</b> in a while but at the least I'm not expecting what they came up with for the previous album so let's see if this will get me to give more songs.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /></div><div>On the bright side this week haha everything above does not come close to this, the upcoming package that I've talking about for weeks is finally on its way!! When will it come I'm not sure but it's definitely some time next week where I'm just tired of work, so tired I may not have any energy left to do a long post because we do have a lot of stuff to cover, so if that's so the new Klassic Note Review will be done on another date just because. <span title="*laughs*">üòÜ</span> Cya guys next week then, and until next time... ask me again if I rather watch new Anime or open packages because something tells me paying for stuff especially for them to ship over is waaaaay more gratifying haha bye</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S. Is it just me or is <a href="https://twitter.com/wedding_ainaka/status/1446717562537103360?s=20" target="_blank">Kido Ibuki in a wedding dress</a> so beautiful and perfect I already want to marry her? She's 23 btw but I think I can be with her for the rest of my life haha okay me</div><div><br /></div><div>P.P.S. And it seems like my dear <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> (I mean Ibuki-chan also counts but) <a href="https://twitter.com/Natsukawa_Staff/status/1447154945288019970?s=20" target="_blank">Natsukawa Shiina's YouTube channel turned music channel is coming back</a> with a regular Monday schedule of clips so... 2nd album preparation maybe?
