<h2>The Entertainment News 2021 Edition Issue #23</h2>
<div id="news-thumbnail" style="display: none;">  <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sAb4xZL2ddI/YLxoCoxwd4I/AAAAAAABFB8/jyolLe2EIG0oGmFMM9t6jzKtZT9i10iHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro09_hug.jpg" /></div><div id="hashtags" style="color: #bbbbbb; font-size: 0.8em;"></div>And just like that, another week passes. <div><br /></div><div>  Hey, I would like to talk more about the stuff that will be shipped to my   place, but somehow it's not there yet. Hopefully by the end of the month haha   like really that's all the time I have for consolidating them. </div><div><br /></div><div>*sigh*</div><div><br /></div><div>  It's this boring now, huh. Haha I need to remind myself to write something   more interesting for the opening just because. Anyways, as I listen to the   songs from   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHLdoq-T-mA" target="_blank">VTuber Tsunomaki Watame's birthday livestream</a>  (happy birthday by the way), I think it's just me not doing much about it, I   guess. Waiting for time to pass? Is that a problem? Is that what happens when you work from home Hey, it's worth the wait   though. Work sucks haha hey great way to start talking about the weekend and Anime I guess </div><div><br /></div><div>  I do have plans to watch critique controversial Netflix original "Eden" but not   this week, maybe next week or end of the month before the next season of Anime   take over. But first, let's continue this season!<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KoiKimo10">    <div style="text-align: center;">  <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">  "A year ago, I would've accepted Matsushima's confession..." Haha I know   right?? And he met Ichika-chan and that's it lol you were ONE YEAR TOO   LATE haha </div>  </blockquote>  Just saying though, if you didn't enjoy the front part with Kana-chan going   all squealing and stuff you don't like Anime. *laughs* In this new episode   (#KoiKimo10) where as much as I love the Matsushima part you can say I'm   totally biased towards <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187178/Arie_Matsushima" target="_blank">the voice behind the character</a> lmao, hey the dad's   finally coming back. Well, gotta happen sometime, huh. *laughs* So, story.   Story goes we continue on Matsushima's confession. Hey, it's not over yet. It   was just a good cliffhanger haha hey Anime production I get it. *laughs*   Anyways, Matsushima once again reminds Ryou of the decisions he has to make at   this point of his life, and it's not as easy as rejecting this wonderful woman   in front of him which if he doesn't want the friend Masuda might take lmao,   but nonetheless as we mentioned last week, this is a good time for Ryou to   think about it now, whether it be making the decisions without giving thought   to others. I mean, love is all but selfish, but until then you gotta take care   of the hundreds of women who were giving you flowers on Valentine's Day, bro.   *laughs* Then, the dad issue. Well, if you would recall Ryou did move out of   his family abode to live alone, so he has an apartment for himself on standby   just in case shit like this happens, so yeah, he pussied out real quick haha.   To avoid his father even further, he even brought his buddy in for drinks and   movie binging, instead of, you know, Matsushima or something. *laughs*   Anyways, Masuda says the same thing to his bro's face surprisingly, so yeah,   that just sinks him even further into the... love mistakes abyss? Haha I don't   know. Even if you give me a crush that is a decade younger than me I wouldn't   have imagined whether I will take her over anything to be honest. Well, I   probably would, but I can't imagine my traditional thinking parents would.   *silence* Moving on, finally Ryou decided on the White Day event, which was just a sweets buffet with the girl because why not girls love sweets. Girls   may love him but Ichika doesn't. *laughs* Or maybe she does, going on how   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a> she   is sounding right now anyways. Someday, bro, someday. Someday you will be able   to justify all your adult actions towards this high schooler lmao. And   surprisingly, Ryou's colleagues appeared out of nowhere. (OOF) It's a birthday   for one of them, and you know, girls love sweets. *laughs* They saw   these two together and thought... maybe that black haired who looks nothing   like Ryou must be his sister...? Haha nice joke, ladies. *laughs* But you   know, Ichika's way IS right "just fake it" because seriously, as much as he wants to get out of girls fawning over him, Ryou still can   keep his reputation at work haha. Also, Ryou, THIS is how you be thoughtful of   others. I mean, I know Ryou really wants to crush (as in physically) all their   hopes of getting laid with him using this   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/JK" target="_blank">JK</a>, but they are   only going to think this is JK as in joking because dude. *laughs* And as they   walk around the city after a satisfying meal because buffet- Wait, we   going to the sea now? WHAT EPISODE IS THIS?? *laughs* I mean, DO WE EVEN HAVE   ANYTHING TO SEE?? *laughs* Oh okay nvm it's just the cityscape thing. And   yeah, Ryou is flexing his manly advances on Ichika again, this jerk. *laughs*   Interestingly, this time around he has some awareness of it, knowing that this   still made his girl mad. Again, it's not about awareness you just gotta stop haha.   Last but not least, the reply. Yes, to Matsushima, from Ryou. Of course you   would have expected it because Ryou is not a two-timer anyways he doesn't have   the balls to, but he was giving the clear message for Matsushima to give up on   him, to any extent I guess. The girl knew of course, because frankly, she   already lost going into this because as she said, she liked Ryou because   Ryou changed because of that very person he liked. ("It's not about winning or   losing" Haha Ryou you don't even know how women think) So yeah, that already   sucks haha. But then yeah, people are then going to assume you are confronting   this age difference thing head on, which, for better or for worse, we shall   see. Yeah, Ryou, you need more than resolve to resolve this situation with   Ichika haha you may have to get rid of your dad lol let's hope it doesn't get   to that. All in all, man is this still the best show I am watching this   season. The drops are anticipated (if you didn't expect Matsushima to cry you   need to watch more romance Anime), the story is basically on track, and we   might not even hit the climax of this series yet. This can go either way depending on whether we actually see the father or not my guess is if they   want to make impact is we will see Ryou get slapped by the dad lol, but   otherwise man, if this series isn't talking seriously about not just age   difference, but the power of love in this case, then don't call this Anime,   because no one out there is going to write controversial love stories like   this every day. So yeah, we shall see how it goes. This hype train can go   anywhere right now and if it means emotional breakdown I'm down for it haha   when's the last time you saw a happy ending on any recent episode haha last   week was hype though hehe </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o5FO3-gauYQ/YLxm8iRLFUI/AAAAAAABFBg/woyRhXVQHEMdDxNVb7NKggHZA3H5T0mWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo10_reflection.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      "Self-reflection time" Literally me after work every day haha  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P1KDLTEjK-4/YLxm9CYgeaI/AAAAAAABFBk/q6BhMFjbpSsw2ATUS_sFXRoDNNj2z2rJwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/koikimo10_matsushima9.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      I felt that Matsushima didn't cry enough so here you go  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Sayu   threw her smartphone away, you see... *laughs* </div>  </blockquote>  Hey bro what do you mean "people with bad intentions took her in" like as if   anyone would have sex with her just so she can survive in Tokyo?? Totally   preposterous. *laughs* In this new episode where I haven't broke character lol   (#HigeHiro09), we have to prove how much of a saint Yoshida is now? Tsk, this   Anime is no fun. *laughs* Hey, morals are questionable, whichever stage or   state you are as a human, trust me. Yes, talking about the brother haha GOT   HIM *laughs* So, story. We stopped literally at the doorstep at Yoshida's   apartment because guess what, Sayu's brother got to her. Took him a while with   the limo and bodyguards, but yeah. *laughs* Not going to question the   potential power he might have or Sayu's family background for now though,   let's just talk about what happened. So, seeing as how the brother is down for   a talk and not just forcing his way out of this situation, I'm sorry for your   work leave Yoshida I bet the other girls are missing you at work. *laughs* And   as his brother puts down his farce painting the nice image on his family and   telling Sayu to go home, he then reveals the truth behind, and as we will also   learn soon enough, it seems like the mother is not concerned of her if she   left home, because if it wasn't the teacher from school who asked about her   whereabouts thinking the mom is keeping her kid in, she might not have even bothered. Worse off, she then told a lie   to the teacher that she's just been cooped up at home and has never left the   place even though she was like, kilometres away from it already lol. Which also   led the school to believe that it might be a family abuse case here instead,   which is probably what prompted the brother to want to resolve this issue as   soon as possible, seeing how extreme this went already in the past couple of   months. Wow, sounds like the mom's a b*tch. *laughs* But yeah that's the   point: the brother also knows the mom is what she is, as he talks to Sayu-chan   alone. Hey, it's not a family problem until everyone in the family agree with   each other haha. And as they have some sibling talk, again I may have to   reference the flashback from Sayu later at this point to be honest, it's not   that simple because besides whatever middle finger Sayu may have dropped on   her own mother by leaving home, it has gotten the worse on her, probably from   the pressure from the school or whatnot, but you get the idea. We kind of have   to save the mother, as much as she's a jerk herself. I don't know man; It's   just logical adult opinion anyways but WE KNOW, this is not going to happen   that easily. And so, the brother gives her another week to make a decision.   Well, that's enough time to say goodbye to her friends and people who have   raped her so far haha hey Yaguchi. *laughs* And then, the flashback. (I just   want to hear about the sex parts, please? Haha just joking) So, I hope you are   ready for a rollercoaster ride, but here goes. Flashback goes that Sayu had   bad relations with her mother, and it only got worse going into high school,   where she doesn't hit the mark in life unlike what her brother is today, as   you can see. She did have a friend to hang out with though, someone called   Yuuko, so I would say she is still blessed. And that's why they say you only   need one or two friends, whichever part of the class or school you might end   up in. Because man, seeing how things are at home? Sayu I wish you didn't have   to go back and face that monstrosity haha ah hey. Problem is, things happened   in school, and as a result Yuuko got bullied because they can't bully Sayu-chan which by the   way is an actual thing in Japanese schools- If you don't believe me believe the   author at least.&nbsp;Well, I'm glad I didn't go through that phase because I   only hang out with dudes who won't get laid and/or don't look any more better   than I am. *dabs* (I'm sorry ma bros but you get the idea haha) But yeah,   instead of like, going to the teacher for assistance which may be for better   or for worse because look at "Sangatsu no Lion" lol okay that one was worse   anyways, the two decided to keep suffering in silence. We know this won't last   long, and one day, it happened. I know suicide isn't really a thing that   should be mentioned, but I'm just glad this isn't a "Ranpo Kitan" scenario   where we see... the... body. Man, didn't expect to use this word after like,   "MajoTabi" but I think we need to let this word shine again... this is very,   VERY "<a href="https://jisho.org/search/minikui" target="_blank">minikui</a>".   *silence* Don't puke; go see the doctor if you need consolation on this   episode lol.&nbsp;Also, Yuuko's explanation will NEVER make sense coming in   from someone who wants to die because she wants to protect that friend of hers   who is infinitely cooler than she is because that's not how this works girl,   she left quite a big crater in her alive friend's life as Sayu struggles to   keep herself together over her friend's death, and also, because someone   dropped down from the rooftop with only her up there, it has gotten quite a   lot of attention. Which again, in case you need a reminder, the mother wasn't   fond of. And that's probably what led to Sayu wanting to leave house. I mean,   you gotta give the author credit for thinking about something like this: your   mom thinking that you killed your bestie is good enough reason to leave house.   I mean, I would. Like Yoshida said, even adults wouldn't deal with this   nonsense. And so, since she got spotted by the brother, and unlike we have   known about this dude since two episodes ago, he assists in her escape, gave   her some money to live for a couple of weeks, and settled in to deal in with   the mother's nonsense, and probably everything happening just in Hokkaido   itself. So yes Sayu, that's why he didn't have the time to contact you, or   even give you more allowance because the mother is probably doubting him on   whether he helped you escape too. Think about it. *taps brain* Anyways, she   got fucked for six months because the first man who approached her wasn't   Yoshida haha too bad, but there you go. Now we know everything. (Well not   everything we need to know every single time she had to stay in for sex-) All   in all, I wonder what will be the solution to this predicament Sayu landed   herself in. Stay here and never go back? I doubt the brother will let that   happen even ignoring the parents. Go back and get screwed in by the mother? I   don't think Sayu will do that either, even if she's totally matured because   considering how things went back there... you get the idea it's going to suck   if she goes back and goes along with the mother's story. Also FUCK YOU MOM!!!   Ah, #FeelsGreatMan there you go Sayu-chan you deserved this rant from me.   *laughs* And seeing how next episode with the Asami drop on Yoshida, I wonder   what Yoshida might do at this point seeing that his matured self also told him   that it's none of his business even though we know the mother's at fault and   at some point the "family" may not even support her too... Yes, ladies and   gentlemen. It's not morality in place anymore. We're going full on selfish   mode here already, I tell you. And boy, if that happens, I'll be darned to see   this till the end.&nbsp; </div><div>  [Since I wrote such a long paragraph here's more: Why didn't the brother tell   Sayu to live her life sustainably even as a student? Well, if she's pampered   or unmotivated then how can you accept to have sex instead? Right? I don't   know man he is such a terrible brother...] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sAb4xZL2ddI/YLxoCoxwd4I/AAAAAAABFB8/jyolLe2EIG0oGmFMM9t6jzKtZT9i10iHwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro09_hug.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      All I want in life right now<br />(Hugs, I just want one)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UQye07BerLc/YLxoEUtgtaI/AAAAAAABFCA/0K2PsFYgdX8rrA34pkslenuMtGFTaQAEQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/higehiro09_sayu2.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      All I wish life is right now<br />(lol)  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Thanks   bro haha </div>  </blockquote>  I mean, WE KNOW shit is going to go down even without Kuroha, just... Sueharu   you gotta live till then bro *laughs* Anyways, in this new episode at the   beach where we now know Shirokusa loves (to cook) fried chicken haha what a coincidence   I know of a female colleague who loves that too we ate those for her birthday   (#OsaMake08), we getting into this new Cooking Arc, huh. *laughs* Hey, don't   tell me not to label these competition stuff this series forced me to see it   that way. But again, the arc labelling days are over, and we did see a lot of   development between the characters themselves so far into this vacation that   they forced themselves to be in because of a music video in the making I   guess. Ignoring all of that because I'm definitely not going to talk about gay   dancing here lol, let's talk about also not the cooking competition. Because   seriously, this is a beach episode: You can't NOT see nothing but women   showing off their swimwear. *laughs* And so Tetsuhiko tells his sister   Rena-chan to not film all this since they can't and go out to play- And she takes it off immediately to show off her   rack haha. "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai" target="_blank">Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai</a>" *laughs* (Thanks, me)   I guess I'll talk about the dialogues running through all of their minds one   in a while, but remember, this is NOT going to be the focus of this episode   haha what. *laughs* In a nutshell though, the guys stop by to buy ingredients   for the cooking showdown which we know who's the winner but who cares, they   arrive at the villa Shirokusa somehow managed to get, and someone gets the VIP   seat for watching Shirokusa show off her banging body SHE SAT ON HIM TOO!!???   *laughs* (That dude's DEFINITELY got a boner right then and there haha) Yeah, I guess you   could call this "appealing to your prey" haha hey you see that hidden smirk on   Shirokusa's face? *laughs* Haha that's what I call a win. Well, I   guess since Maria-chan had no rack anyways she still had to pad it- Ah. *laughs*   Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the fanservice this episode; I personally loved   Kuroha screaming at home thinking about the others enjoying themselves in   Okinawa lmao. Next up, the competition or not at this point. Seeing as   how Shirokusa can't even do hotpot (Haha I mean ask   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/169840/Nasa_Yuzaki" target="_blank">Nasa-kun</a>  man; He'll teach you how to make the healthiest and blandest hotpot in your   life lmao) (But yes basically just boil stuff, seasonings not required haha) and is just   sulking in a corner just because (I also like to think <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/187166/Shirokusa_Kachi" target="_blank">the voice behind the character</a>&nbsp;can't whip up a hotpot too lol), Sueharu ditched helping Maria out and as if   this is not obvious enough who he likes more, he does the manly thing to   console his... childhood... friend haha PSYCHE *laughs* And yes I agree with   Sueharu, it's Shirokusa not trying to be herself. It may be hard on her to be   honest, but that is what even her buddy can see through her after knowing her   for long enough. And... we don't want to talk about whether they kissed or not   lol that one quote came in at the right moment haha. So keeping this short   because you got more to see than I can describe here hehe, all in all, didn't   I say last week that it's one episode of not Kuroha and then another with just   Kuroha- Don't second guess me now. *laughs* Well, I can at least say it's all   going well now, whether it's character realization or enlightenment or   whatever Maria-chan is losing to or something haha, but you get the idea. They can't   ALL be winners. Not like Sueharu haha okay I think Tetsuhiko's the winner here   tbh lmao cya guys next week I just want more Inorin haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; Shirokusa's bikini view is so zoomed in I can't even get a full image   to screenshot so excuse me while I go back and see it agian haha   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/11622/Ayane_Sakura" target="_blank">Sakura Ayane</a>  WISHED she had this body lmao I wonder what's up for next week lol] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9xSfzEy2-pk/YLxr2RnngXI/AAAAAAABFCc/HYRwBJrCG_UoD1MOFA0WqZuPGy6fWjWiQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/osamake08_sisters1.jpg" width="320" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      She's wearing a shirt that writes "LOVE"    <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bakabakashi" target="_blank">that's so stupid</a>      haha  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">  <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <tbody>   <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">   <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t8YYOrkQ7kQ/YLxsA5jngfI/AAAAAAABFCg/b1W7Tr909hw78ttZe0n_zfhnsRrwBBSwQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/osamake08_oh.gif" /> </td>   </tr>   <tr> <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">      How you know Sueharu got a boner haha  </td>   </tr> </tbody>  </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Specifically <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%99%BD%E5%A4%9C-%E6%A5%B5%E5%A4%9C-e-p/1567542664?l=en" target="_blank">cinema staff's new EP</a></b> is something a long time coming, and man I know I may not be into this that much considering it's hard to get back to their quirky style anyways, but I did give a song. Yeah, I know, just one. Hey, more songs please. *laughs* What did have a lot of songs though considering she has reached her 15th anniversary as a singer, is <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/highlights-from-simple-is-best/1567530284?l=en" target="_blank">Teshima Aoi's best album</a></b> and besides being real irritating because older songs were live versions and remasters only happen on recent songs so then why remaster them (no really even the one in February this year?), but suffice it to say those live ones might still be better than the one song which I decided to listen back to her 2007 album and... man it wasn't as good as the one in the best album haha. Anyways, so yeah, logistical issue, the songs were given regardless, and man is Teshima Aoi great to listen in like, a quiet room in the highest quality- SHE should be the reason you buy hi-res audio lol</div><div><br />  On news concerning music and is on Twitter and trust me I want to talk about not music here so bad but I won't, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/3_phantasia/status/1399723191472476171?s=20" target="_blank">Sangatsu no Phantasia's new single is going to be a theme song for Anime</a></b> next season so yay finally not digital singles and/or for her literary works in case you didn't notice, I finally found <b><a href="https://twitter.com/primary_yuiko/status/1399735150578061317?s=20" target="_blank">Primary's music library on music subscription services</a></b> because yuiko the vocalist parked them under her name so I don't know if that is a good thing or not but whatever I found it haha and you bet I'll be listening the heck out of them, interestingly <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1400029431985541120?s=20" target="_blank">Touyama Nao's new music video is released in full</a></b> after it has been revealed on the livestream which is not archived I believe but hey it's always good news when that happens, don't ask me why <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sphere_PS/status/1400406918703849473?s=20" target="_blank">Toyosaki Aki's new album cover</a></b> has a camel in it lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/staff_azumi/status/1400014325226614784?s=20" target="_blank">Waki Azumi's new lyric video</a></b> is a sad yet real nice one so yeah something to listen in her upcoming single lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1400471182395142148?s=20" target="_blank">Ryokuoushoku Shakai's new song is out</a></b> on subscription services and so is <a href="https://twitter.com/ryokushaka/status/1400833960607768578?s=20" target="_blank">their live video for that new song</a> on YouTube, SACRA-chan leaked something off <b><a href="https://twitter.com/sacramusic_jp/status/1400667050494754827?s=20" target="_blank">TrySail's new music video</a></b> haha whatever you can read it yourself, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1400784489333157892?s=20" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES is releasing a new song</a></b> end of the month and as they mentioned themselves <a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1400784726307213316?s=20" target="_blank">it's been more than a year already</a>, I must say&nbsp;<b><a href="https://twitter.com/SHE_S_official_/status/1400409246978633729?s=20" target="_blank">SHE's new music video</a></b> which already had a digital release back in April is something you should watch yourself, and this one I'll already be listening to it later but <b><a href="https://twitter.com/SPE_INFO/status/1401509191181733894?s=20" target="_blank">SPECIAL OTHERS is releasing a new song for their 15th anniversary</a></b> which is technically a retake of their classic tune "IDOL". Well, they just learnt this blog by slapping a "The" in front of it lol okay I swear that was a coincidence, but yeah. I guess I'll be tuning into that before anyone reads this haha<br />  <br />  There isn't much going on for next week (Audience: TrySail?) so I guess I can take a break for now. Or maybe dig through the songs I heard from Watame's livestream as mentioned in the intro of this post. We shall see. Someone will be kind enough to list ALL the songs performed lol yes this is how much VTubers have infiltrated YouTube btw (Chara-san? Not you again I can't give your weird songs stop sounding so good)<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />Maybe, just maybe, I am just burnt out. Because seriously, as I look back on my posts even from two years ago where I started to revamp this site with my knowledge from work ie. the power of JavaScript lol, I spent so much effort even talking about the smallest stuff in life, and now it's like only this weekly post and when those packages arrive. What was I to do if nothing arrives at my place, and I have no Anime to watch? Haha that'll be the day. But until then(?) I guess take care then I'm already feeling kinda quirky just working from home and going to the office every other way. Or was it that caffeine overdose yesterday that didn't subside? Hey, told you to stop drinking too much coffee already, me. *laughs* Cya guys soon.</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
