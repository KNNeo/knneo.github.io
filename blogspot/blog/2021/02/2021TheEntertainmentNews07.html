The holidays from like, Thursday because   I took time off since the boss not giving it for Chinese New Year and honestly   how many houses can you visit in this time? So yeah, it's just a time for me   to chill and drink up a whole large cup of iced salted caramel coffee HAHAHAHA   and that one screwed me real hard for the rest of yesterday tbh </div><div><br /></div><div>  On other news before we proceed, the package is coming together. Got scammed   by Animate because they asked for one authorization for TWO purchases though   remember I mentioned how I could've waited a week and got both in one order?   Oh well. *laughs* NOW we can talk about Anime haha<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogsWan05">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "It's the perfect time to read sophisticated books I can't get" lol is       this how you look cool Dazai? Hahah     </div>  </blockquote>  Okay don't look up what is a sty it's... not great haha in this new episode   (#BungouStrayDogsWan05) I guess we're doing school life already ok where were   we again? *laughs* Oh yeah,   <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p1UwUrJylEM/X98OD7sLliI/AAAAAAABAaY/h9WCcVJFNhMwY7oqhXcDn8WFcIOC-nEAwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/jyoshimuda02_yamamoto2.jpg" target="_blank">Yamamoto</a>  from Anime "JoshiMuda". *laughs* Also, is pudding the solution to kids? Memo   memo haha. So, we're talking about a lot of Dazai and I guess specifically   Chuuya, it looks like. Because yeah despite totally ignoring   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/196/Kishou_Taniyama" target="_blank">who voiced this dude</a>, man is it getting creepy when he has to voice all these... I don't know.   Unique situations? *laughs* Of character, I guess, but yeah, it's getting   creepy, I'm with Dazai haha. Firstly, middle school? Well, they gotta slot   that in somewhere, so might as well haha. So, the two were just fighting over   how cool they were even though they think they each are, and if you didn't   watch "JoshiMuda" and think this is not lame, good on you because my glasses   would've shattered at some point if not for Mori Ougai and that... other guy   which I don't remember from the main series like really I forgot lol. And   yeah, pudding me the solution to everything I guess. Next up, shopping habits   of Chuuya and Dazai in comparison. Obviously, they despise and probably not   understand why the other will buy such stuff (more on Dazai probably haha I've   only got bandages ONCE in my life so far lol), so yeah, so much for   understanding I guess. But seriously, even if they did sat down and shared   what cool shit or sale they participated in, the other probably wouldn't even   want to give chance to listen to them. Quite similar to a married couple   relationship gone sour imo haha. Lastly, about dogs. There is the one before   in the shopping trip where they saw the same poster on raising a pack of dogs   and they would've helped clear all 10 of them though separately lol, this one   came from a musical that Chuuya watched. Yeah, start pondering about his life   choices haha hey at least he'll get laid because I watch shit like this series   lol. Anyways, as hinted by Dazai, Chuuya wants to pick up an innocent   abandoned dog on the streets so bad until... he saw Dazai being one. Yes,   being a dog. *laughs* Please, laugh at those "you're the dog" jokes from   Dazai, because apparently he thinks Chuuya whatever whatever lol, but yeah,   Chuuya may want to raise a dog, and probably can't even raise it close enough   to Kunikida's level for cats haha, but suffice it to say Dazai's dog dreams   aren't going to come true lol what. All in all, kudos for Akutagawa's   appearance (twice) in this episode lol he's the MVP this week haha, and man,   it might be getting rather dull because we know Chuuya is boring lmao, but   hey, still waiting on that Gin or Naomi episode lol okay me </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OLVPP546g40/YCjALQANSpI/AAAAAAABB0I/bYQPLEqY_Y8inPqZ_k1w5gZmhyDhrrYNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan05_tie.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              You think those guys working at the post office are this               passionate at wrapping your packages? lmao             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9qCj7_Kvt10/YCjALdwC0_I/AAAAAAABB0M/oCsKdlEmwxc6GnM3ziR9gRvZ6dH-f3uBACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan05_snoopy.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Definitely not a Sn**py reference lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Wow that is the most reluctant       question for a father EVER lol that's how much they hate you?     </div>  </blockquote>  "It's cold sweat" Yeah that's how much they don't want Kyousuke to be around   lmao I mean look at the mother who rather sit on the floor than the sofa.   *laughs* In this new episode (#Horimiya06) of "why can't I just have a ding   dong with your daughter in your property" lmao... yeah the father's getting a   little irritating- Maybe he wants to bond with his future son-in-law? *laughs*   Okay, maybe, we don't know, So, story. Well, it's the above, the father being   a nuisance in a nutshell lol, but also, probably is his way to finding a way   through this son-in-law candidate because you know, all fathers be protective   of their daughters, especially this daughter. *laughs* Hey, like father, like   daughter, they say. But seriously though, we don't need a "<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37722/Uchi_no_Maid_ga_Uzasugiru" target="_blank">UzaMaid</a>" ripoff haha "UzaDad" lol. So yeah, in the opportunity that the dad gets to   make Miyaura sleep in the same room with him (lol not   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/BL" target="_blank">BL</a> I promise you) he   then asked very indirectly like how every other dad will lol, about his   daughter. Hey, gotta hit that question someday. For Miyamura though, he hit   the point so well, I think the dad was satisfied with the answer. Hey, judging   a book by its cover is a real Achilles' heel to many, by the way. That's me   with idolism lmao I'm so screwed already tbh. Also, you see, dad, the pros of   dating this guy is no one else will fight for him, says not Hori haha   should've asked the daughter for her opinion too while they are at it. But   really, give them some couple space, would you, dad? *laughs* And then,   Miyamura really screwed up his new image in school. Well, not that he can't   get a haircut in summer, but man, you forgot about your piercings and tattoos?   *laughs* Then again, it did clear up the weird tension and image the school   has so far about the main couple though, saying things equivalent to like some   yankee took the beautiful girl in school and stuff haha. Okay, you jealous   freaks, so hump a wall or something. *laughs* (*looks at self and cries*) So   yeah, got the girls interested in Miyamura for some reason but we know they   are going to freak out once they see the tattoos, but not unless you can get   around Hori's stares in the distance which instantly lowers the temperature of   the classroom lol Hori didn't know you're a   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/yukionna" target="_blank">snow woman</a>.   Next up, we have some Shindou action because why not. His girl won't get any   though so whatever haha but she did just take all the good stuff. By that, we   meant his newly won bag of sweets of course. But come on, Shindou, we know   your bag of (shitty flavour) candies is not as <u>sweet</u> as Miyamura's   kiss- Happy Valentine's Day everybody. *laughs* Yeah, gonna do this a   <u>couple</u> more times- Happy Valentine's Day. *laughs* Also, this is how   you treat your close friends? You give the good ones to your classmates first?   Don't call me your bro anymore, bro. *laughs* Anyways, who gives a damn about   the guy eating a cheese candy, because a clay one will taste infinitely better   HAHAHAHAHA moving on. *laughs* We got a stalker on our hands. *laughs* Okay,   joke talk, but it's something like that, so let's talk about the new character   Sawada. As expected this new girl, this is the aggressive one. Hey, we haven't   really seen any action in this series so far you think we can call this a   romance Anime? *laughs* Sadly, her aggression is because of... dear girl   Honoka you know this is not an all-girls school right? *laughs* So yeah, a lot   of things in her past we don't know, but I think with this episode we should   have a good idea to be honest. Firstly, her likely admiration for Hori maybe   even sexually but we don't want to know who's wearing the strap-on. *laughs*   (Sorry, lesbian porno joke) Interestingly, Miyamura doesn't want to like, let   this happen? I don't know. Hori is into women? *laughs* Anyways, it's likely a   story that'll never end which is nice because we got something to fall behind   to, because now that we have fell down to Sawada's level and we be talking   about her... dead brother who looks <i>exactly</i> like Miyamura... bro you be   glad your hair will grow back in a few months and she'll stop clinging on to   you like she's your imouto lmao. Hey, both are all in the name of love, what   gives, right? And Miyamura is being nice to her too (I was totally expecting   he'll climb the balcony to open the door to her place though lol, instead of   inviting her into his place... Hori-san?), probably to spare himself the   trouble to having this b*tch go hot on heels over Hori who technically has   been taken at this point. *laughs* But man, did the story get real dark at   some point. Moving on from this like for real, we got the weekly "Hori starts   to question the lack of Miyamura's moves on her" thing for the episode lol. I   mean, because your dad's in the way, man. And that Sawada b*tch too? So you   see, it's not that easy. *laughs* He got that kiss though, I will say that   much, he nailed that thing real well haha. But you know, Hori, you gotta give   this more time. Not like we're rushing to prove to Sawada or the dad that they   are a thing... or are we? *giggles* All in all, you know what, Miyamura? I'll   be a bro and date this Honoka girl for you- Oh wait. *laughs* Then again,   these two might be together in the end, who knows? Now THIS is what I want out   of this series haha. Okay, whatever, Anime, you do you. Then again, you can   come up with as many people to play around as you like. It's romance Anime   man, and unless   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/41389/Tonikaku_Kawaii" target="_blank">you're married from Episode 1</a>  *wink* you can do whatever you want haha ok I'm done </div><div>  [TL:DR; If you laughed at when the one schoolmate talked about Miyamura   two-timing Hori with Sawada... hahaha it's too real though that girl is right   to assume that with all the rumours going around] </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kDojogeyrN0/YCkTceWgzUI/AAAAAAABB0k/t0vrrUChi18RZ4X419R6c8kl7vefbB34ACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya06_choke1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week on violence we have:<br />Can't wait to choke the heck               out of my girlfriend lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RH_4No2JCm8/YCkTcfJPHuI/AAAAAAABB0o/z20qVGmb9DEtUY2RQTBJTxMPEx2n-ZUZACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya06_kick.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week on violence we have:<br />You think the dad needs               counselling or he's like               <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/95629/Shirosaki" target="_blank">Shiro</a>              from "Kawaisou"? lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>   P.S.

Not much this week. But I am preparing for next week, which is now,     even more padded with new releases because I went for a dig for artists I     know and thanks to also YouTube, I get to see it all. So yeah, remember     above when I said I had a break? Haha I was thinking of how to clean up     Klassic Note and that database I thought would make this management thing     easier lol <i>it's not</i><br />    <br />    On news concerning music and not love but it's on Twitter, didn't notice     <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lounge666/status/1346743468589260800?s=20" target="_blank">SIX LOUNGE is releasing an album in April</a></b>    so I listened to both their new music videos and man am I hyped already,     Ryokuoushoku Shakai's "Mela" music video reached 20 million views     considering it's the best song of Klassic Note 2020 (I know, international     ones reach tenfold of these but this is Japan level awesome), I was touched     by     <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KlassicNote/status/1359843864522072068?s=20" target="_blank">Cocco's new music video</a></b>    so I'm reviewing her album which comes out next week (yep) unlike     <b>Teshima Aoi's new single</b> so that's that, and if you watched Naobou's     Valentine's Day livestream on YouTube which isn't archived by the way,<b>      <a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1360921740436639752?s=20" target="_blank">Touyama Nao is releasing a concept mini-album</a></b>    in May, with the theme of relaxation and soft singing. I mean, she is hardly     that kind of person, and unless you reach the levels of Tomatsu Haruka (back     then) or Ueda Reina (right now) I doubt it'll make an impression. Heck, I'll     still listen to them though. *laughs*<br />    <br />So, since I'm giving some Cocco-san since like, 5 years ago, besides     <b>Cocco's new album</b> we have a lot more including     <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/oikaze-ep/1548426061?l=en" target="_blank">SHE'S new single</a></b>    which I'm not hopeful for but I'll give mainstream as many chances as they     need, <b>ClariS' new single</b> for Anime "Hataraku Saibou", and     <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/cho-kakumei-teki-koi-suru-nichijou/1547563250?l=en" target="_blank">Waki Azumi's 1st full album</a></b>    which if you need a reminder does not have old songs ie. all 10 of them are     new. Which one I'm looking forward to the most? I mean, you want to look at     what's my wallpaper now? *laughs* I bought her photobook already what more     do you want? Good songs, hopefully; Fingers crossed.<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    Well, I'm done for the week. This week has been great. I mean, half the week     of work leave and holidays? You're welcome, life. *laughs* But there's much     work ready for me to see to starting tomorrow, so I guess I gotta go back so     I can actually enjoy my birthday leave again for this year which is, yes,     upcoming Friday. Those two photobooks won't come by by then, but I'll be     glad to see it happen across the Internet. You know, notifications and     stuff. And things like they didn't prompt me they were charging twice in     succession, damn Animate, ending up using my... not so advantageous card for     payment. *sigh* Oh well, Ajuju, I sure hope it was worth it. So please,     don't spoil them I beg you all, so I can actually... actually... I'm going     to dream about her tonight haha. Cya guys next week then, and until next     time... uh... uh... go hug your partner and say you love them right now,     thank me later. Okay gotta go I need some water real quick since the start     of this final paragraph haha bye<br />  </div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>    P.S. Because I'm going to explode if I don't talk about it, Red Dead Online     so far has been a blast. Well, coming in from buying the online version only     of course, got enough to purchase the Bounty Hunter license (thought a lot     between this and Trader specialist) to now screw with people so that I can     catch people in the name of the law. Well, catching unfaithful people     killing their significant other is just coincidental for today haha ah hey I     haven't experienced that so I don't know   </div></div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><br><h5 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2020 Klassic Note Web Reports</h5><br></div>
