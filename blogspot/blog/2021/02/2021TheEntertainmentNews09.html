I could have easily blamed those Taketatsu Ayana bromides which I   could have not purchased (because she hit the quota in my collection already)   which actually delayed shipping for a couple of days which would have made all   the difference AND considering the next package is just in one week a couple   of days after I sent the former in which is a future Klassic Note Review   (<span title="*wink*">😉</span> Marinka <span title="*wink*">😉</span>) so I could have let that wait for this one anyways.... </div><div><br /></div><div>  Next up, I'm not feeling too well. As I'm writing this I'm probably already   waiting to go to see the doctor tomorrow because... who opens on Sundays?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, that'll probably get me a week's worth of MC considering   that pandemic out there, so I guess I'll have a lot of time to do up the   unboxing and many posts that will come up next week once I feel like, better   better. I just wanted to settle those two photobooks by this month man... </div><div><br /></div><div>  Let's just hope the bad news stop here. *cough* Ugh, I really hope that is all   haha let's talk Anime while I still can then! No promises on Titan though, but   I'll try to watch that soon after it airs tonight<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="BungouStrayDogsWan07">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Bungou Stray Dogs Wan!</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "Bungou Stray Dogs Preschool!" Ooo boy haha     </div>  </blockquote>  Yeah, I saw those spoilers on their official Twitter. They had to introduce   "new characters" which are just kid them lol why is Dazai the teacher?   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode (#BungouStrayDogs07) I mean come on we know Kenji   is the only one living the most accurate lifestyle as a three-year-old.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I mean, what'cha gonna do besides eat and sleep? Right? Haha hey,   what do I know. That's a lot of content with just a different setting, so   let's talk about them. Firstly, the roles. Apparently, Dazai is a teacher   along with Yosano and... that other one lol, Chuuya's the not bad guy but   senior somehow (lol why are you in the same group they never split classes by year?), I   assume the President is the Principal too haha, and the rest are kids.   Yes, including the detective and that bomb guy who will appear later. So, the   kids do what kids normally do in preschool: play around, make friends (Chuuya   doesn't have any is the joke lol), do craftwork (Kyouka may suck at cutting   but she be good at folding so   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/origami" target="_blank">origami</a>),   someone shit on Chuuya for being short again as usual (lmao especially when   the age is this young and he's still shorter) and it's just like everyday even   without the preschool context lol. Then, it's storytime. Sadly, it's Dazai, so   you only read his works ie. all the suicidal ones, and kudos for them to   reference all the original works from their respective named authors (In case   you know nothing about this series the author did not come up with names but   instead envisioned special powers from literary masters from the past two centuries in   Japan, and everything is based on that, where in this case their Ability is based off their books), so yeah in case you haven't read them   yet... well I haven't even read Hyouka so I won't tell you to anyways. Then   again those aren't for kids and since them kids rather read them picture books   you lost bro. Then, Chuuya wants to challenge the lemon bomb guy to rugby.   Trust me, that ball won't be coming back as a ball, I tell you. *hears   explosion* What did I tell you. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Oh don't worry, they put that person   in there so they can make all those <strike>terrorism</strike> bomb jokes when   they have to lol. Ranpo has a problem making friends because he's too smart   but is surprisingly good at finding stuff... So since we're all together, we   have to talk about what's popular on TV,   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/144971/Sakunosuke_Oda" target="_blank">Odasaku</a>-Man. I'm so sorry if you forgot about this reference, but you should link   this to Dazai IMMEDIATELY because if he doesn't like his buddy on TV I don't   know what will. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> But you know, Chuuya had to show his ultimate in   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsundere" target="_blank">tsundere</a>-ism   by saying this is for kids despite being one, and only just slightly senior   than everyone else on the floor, literally. (Not cute by the way I'm not into   dudes lol) All in all, Dazai is not popular as a teacher anyways since he'll   die before those kids graduate lol, and trust me when I say that Naomi part is   the best lmao haha I want an   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/imouto" target="_blank">imouto</a> to cling   on to me so bad I can't even </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LwSK9ioO6ns/YDuHEyYsr3I/AAAAAAABCDE/fsyL5nOTMKo1Ha9NP4TPK141d4iPre7RwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan07_beds.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              Clearly there's something wrong with this image lol Tanizawa you               don't know how lucky you were to be have a younger sister             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lT_n62zFtdA/YDuHE-G8pMI/AAAAAAABCDA/zj5StHB6LFc3YnkqmvdkET6OBp02YmnYQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/straydogswan07_kids2.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              #DadGoals Wait, what?

"I WILL"   Haha Akutagawa in a nutshell ladies and gentlemen </div><div>  P.P.S. I know it's also because the character is such, but man is everyone   else (still) shitting on Chuuya (and possibly the voice actor in the process)   while they doing this series lol I wonder what it's like in the studio   disrespecting your elders haha (No really, Miyano Mamoru may be a veteran like   Kana-chan at this point but that doesn't mean you can shit on the real   veterans, geez)<br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="Horimiya08">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Horimiya</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span style="text-align: left;">"You'll find someone who will cry for you, get mad at you, scold you         when you need to..." Oh you meant my mom? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span></span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <span style="text-align: center;">"Can I just die?" Oh boy hold on for a moment haha you see if you die you     won't see the day you'll get laid. <span title="*silence*">😐</span>&nbsp;</span>In this new episode (#Horimiya08) I guess we can talk a little more about   Remi-chan, yes? I mean, if she's supposed to be the cute icon in this   series... well we shall see her true form this week lol. So firstly, about   Remi. Well, about Remi, on Sengoku. Because really, we have heard of his story   before, so why would anyone, ANYONE this cowardly? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Okay, talking from   Hori's perspective here, I'm one of them too so whatever he already wins being   Student Council President. So yeah, in summary, it's how Remi is actually good   at observing people. And basically how she knows all his weaknesses, and his   courage to take on them all. Including Hori, yes. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Again, if that is   how Sengoku managed to convince Hori to not sh*t on him being a childhood   friend... and letting Remi do no work for the Council, oh well he has come a   long way I guess. Still, ignoring that part, we can talk about how this   relationship came about. It was about the time where the school's "Beauty and   the Beast" were still a thing, yes referring to Sakura and Remi goddamn, but   instead of talking about Sakura we talk about the Beast. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, to each   its own, yes? Anyways, Remi spotted Sengoku reading other books in class, and   then in came the "can I borrow your books to read" kind of portable library   book classmate/friend thing. You know, if you haven't had those before, where   you can spend breaks reading those stuff that your teacher keeps preventing   you from bringing into school just because but you know are waaaay more   interesting than textbooks? Yeah, those. For me it was manga haha thanks   BLEACH. It's also those kind of friends that you know where sometimes you   wonder how that dude has so many books, you want to go to his place to see- Ah   yep. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So, if you need a love story intro, start keeping books in your   place. Eh, mine's all CDs which no one else listens to but me so... YUI,   anyone? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> The two particularly referenced on a book talking about the   last day of Earth, and what one would do before it ends. I mean, Remi with the   "because I can die fat" analogy lol LAME haha, and later as she asked Sengoku,   he replied he will confess to the girl in the same room as him. Hey, I thought   he'd only say that before the world ends so... the world's ending tomorrow?   Hey, IS THE WORLD ENDING TOMORROW- Okay me haha. Also, sweet transition into a   pick-up line though. *memo memo* He's totally embarrassed about that though   haha. This is just many of Sengoku's own character which many won't see but   Remi does, and likes him for it. Really makes me ask myself: Do I have those   hidden attributes that no one has seen yet? I don't know, you tell me.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And then, we have violent Miyamura. Yes, the reign of violent Hori is   over, my lads. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Well, it's more like Hori thinks that why is his boy   so nice to her, but not to his other friends just because. But then again,   don't you want to lovey-dovey and not shit on each other when you are dating   anyways? Those are exclusively reserved for <i>after</i> marriage lmao. Also   also, sadist Miyamura looks like Hori's dad?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Hey, they do say your   preferences are easily influenced by things around your life so... Haha let's   move on. Lastly, Yuki-chan gets a confession from someone else. Yep, I heard   her name so many times I don't have to refer to her as Yoshikawa anymore lol.   Okay, just a head's up, it's really someone entirely new, and he did confess   to her (without getting it wrong, we'll get to that later) and it has been a   couple of days already so... as with all confessions you gotta send back a   reply. In this case, the guys decide to let Ishikawa do the manly job of... I   mean she kind of wants to be with him for more than a day so...? Haha. Turns   out, this Yanagi dude, real   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/ikemen" target="_blank">ikemen</a>, is only   interesting because why wouldn't be wearing glasses I don't even know. I mean,   if you are kind of short-sighted I have to wonder how bad your eyes can't   discern colour. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> 'Cos man, this series be a colourful mess and you   can't recognise by that? I'll only be confused by you and Sengoku, man.   <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, the dude got the hint with Ishikawa standing by her, so   yeah. But we all agree Yanagi would be a great dude to date, right? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   Man, Yoshikawa, you could've dated him, flunked him and then get your love   consultation from Ishikawa and THEN date him- I'm going the long route here by   the way haha. Also, you see, if you say no to someone also really means you   like someone. Yeah? Hey, what do I know no one came for me yet. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All   in all, nice episode to talk about main and sub and not leave them aside for   too long, so that's already a good balance in terms of drama and progression.   Can't wait for Ishikawa and Yoshikawa to go steady and then break up and   Yanagi can come in with the kill lol bye </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZAnVbFy5VIA/YDuMvXZsV3I/AAAAAAABCDY/IAEzoLYb2rsJhh8FSlRX3aJEvQbn5Y3HACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya08_hori3.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This week on violence: Wait, the target is Hori? lol             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyhsXHVeW5U/YDuMvYBqv9I/AAAAAAABCDU/Eqi9mdKcReMbS8UKje-5tXceh7ZgJz_bQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/horimiya08_yanagi.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              MFW I see any guy who looks cooler than me which is everybody haha               <span title="*sob*">😢</span>             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

Sometimes, you gotta mix a little       truth into it" Well said, Pyxis. Well said.     </div>  </blockquote>  Really, Anime? Is that a molestation joke? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, let's talk about   not Armin didn't miss him at all lol. In this new episode (#AttackOnTitan71)   wow we have a shitload of development going, getting me all pumped up (ok   chill, body, you not be that fit yet) so let's talk about them, shall we?   Firstly, the intent of Eren himself. Remember since like, the past few   episode, we have seen the citizens of Paradis support Eren's release because   the military have yet to explain the detaining of Eren, let alone know about   it, so that should get you suspicious. Adding on, this episode we know from   Yelena's confession that <strike>he</strike> she did have a conversation with   Eren, which likely shows how this might have incited Eren to work   independently, to infiltrate the Marley kingdom and eventually, wipe out like   half its forces from down up. Problem is, these so-called "supporters" have   been going into action more recently. With the bombing of the Premier in the   headquarters right after Mikasa and Armin left his room which puts them in   high suspicion since then, but makes you wonder how the three Scouts who   entered ended up bombing the leader of the military with ease, thus then   strengthening the supporters and their support for Eren and his release. And   surprise surprise, not long after, Eren was released. I mean, probably by   himself, but also with the help of many prisoners underground, which will   explain now that he does have some sort of backing. I would argue though?   Until here, we might not be too involved with what is up next with Zeke,   mainly because we shouldn't be assuming that Eren is supporting Zeke in any   way, even though we know at this point everyone believes that his plan is   likely the only plan that will save the <strike>island</strike> race from the   rest of the world maybe. So, at this point, let's assume Eren is by his own,   but has gained enough of a following to be able to fight against the military   on his own. Because remember when he was arrested after the fight in Marley   that the military still mentioned he still needs them? Well, not anymore. Next   up, what the current Paradis military has to do to catch up. Considering the   useless Premier is dead good time, Pyxis becomes the likely top leader to take   over, and thus, besides the direct order for everyone to cut ties with the   Levi squad holding Zeke hostage such that Eren's team can't get to them before   we all find out what is the ultimate plan anyways, but suffice it to say Pyxis   also mentioned something important that everyone has to swallow including   their top leader's death: infighting will be the ultimate demise of the   military. For he is so right in realising that the military is now filled with   traitors who will at any point turn against them and help Eren achieve what he   wants, so now is to ensure... well everyone will converge at some point so   what gives? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> We'll try to keep as many alive as possible, Commander,   no joke. But yeah, it's pretty obvious what happened this week. Yeah, the cat   got let out of the bag real good here. It's interesting to think that we have   no idea what Eren wants, but now just because he has backing, he is able to do   whatever he wants, without people in his way because basically the last thing   in his way now is the military. Well, before last week's episode anyways. And   as for next episode, we have two things right up our alley. Firstly, a peek at   Pieck-san apparently, blending into the streets of Paradis. Wait, what? Haha   yep. Then, I guess we're going back to Gabi and Falco working at a restaurant   now, which will probably get them killed considering the ones they be relying   on their leader just showed her ties with the most dangerous guy on the   island... well I think those two kids can take care of themselves haha cya   guys then </div><div>  <div class="thumbnail">    <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AMm2V5QVLYE/YD4qY8PxpcI/AAAAAAABCFY/fZRUM6Q7ZCoiIiKQdLXbY7e6ZRZB7PBPQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan71_eren3.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              It's so cool, you almost forgot Eren's the bad guy now             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>    <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">      <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">        <tbody>          <tr>            <td style="text-align: center;">              <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R4mBQY08vPM/YD4qY2o2mhI/AAAAAAABCFc/beMpxK13kkcx6z8IyNd44UHbqzUMzQgMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/attackontitan71_pyxis1.jpg" width="320" />            </td>          </tr>          <tr>            <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">              This guy is cooler haha no really it's when everyone's dead that               he gets to shine just like me             </td>          </tr>        </tbody>      </table>    </div>  </div>  P.S.

(FYI   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E6%84%9B%E6%98%A7%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%82%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86/1545243186?i=1545243188&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Watame</a>  because she has a nice singing voice so Klassic Note requirements met, and   <a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/say-%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AC/1538909248?i=1538909249&amp;l=en" target="_blank">Fubuki</a>  because we could use a   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJSH0McCpwI" target="_blank">Senko-san</a>  sequel haha what) (Also, someone who wants a matured voice but got the kawaii   one instead; Poor thing, we see those people A LOT) I gave   <b>sphere's new single</b> which I'm still thinking of whether it would count   to give the physical release considering the rest are self covers (and it is a   set with goods so no way haha) so I probably wouldn't be buying those in the   first place. So, this week's new songs. <b>Kouno Marika's new single</b> did   grow in me eventually so I just gave it anyways which means it'll start this   year's Reviews, unlike <b>Teshima Aoi's new single</b> which I only ended up   liking the topic song which is great I could use more emotional songs as I   said, and <b>Ikimonogakari's new single</b> for Anime series "Boruto" because   I know the upcoming album will cover this too. Last but not least, since they   sang it in their acoustic live on the day of release, I also gave   <b>LuckLife's new song</b> which is on digital platforms, which isn't bad   actually I wanted better so maybe it's me putting my expectations too high. I   mean, their releases since they went independent did not disappoint I didn't   want this to break the streak to be honest. Oh well. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> </div><div><br /></div><div>  On news concerning music or not as and when I choose to pad the Twitter news   in this paragraph, apparently   <b>Friend's new single will have a Tomatsu Haruka version</b> of the song (who   voices Hori-san) which will be nice is this the resurgence of her solo music   career because I doubt so lol (remember her kid?), Anime series "Kaguya-sama"   announced a third season which is nice and very expected it's just when only,   Anime series "KanoKari" confirmed their second season in 2022 which is likely   delayed due to the world still on fire already,   <b>ORESKABAND's new music video</b> is... very ska I guess lol where's the new   release, I did not participate in any capacity because I really did not bother   with <b>YUI's self cover album memorial fill-ins</b> where they ask people to   use a certain format of an image and fill in with what songs they thought were   great and their comments (FYI mine is none of them it's "My Generation"   probably, and I think I mentioned it back in 2012 so), and happy birthday   <b>Takahashi Rie and her solo music debut announcement</b> because who here   has waited years for Rieri here to get original songs for herself? And as I   saw the announcement (I'm talking about the last one more) yesterday night   wondering who's the music label associated with her (eg. Marinka's is Columbia   Japan, who also hosts Yuuki Aoi, Tomiya Miyu and Waki Azumi) and found out   that it might be under a new Anime-based label from A-Sketch. THE ORAL   CIGARETTES and flumpool are there so... maybe we get songs produced by them   soon?? Haha, so many questions really, and from the teaser trailer it just   feels like she's going to be one of those power singers, so I wouldn't bother   to get too excited already lol<br />  <br />So, for next week and hopefully I can be in a state to listen to them.   well it's only SCANDAL's new single which I've heard nothing of so far, so for   now maybe I'll just listen to this when I have the time. Or probably more when   I really have the time we shall see<br />  <br />  <br />  <br /><br />  In anticipation of the upcoming package(s) (yes) for next week and me probably   lying on bed for the next couple of days soon or not, if you see the lack of   effort for the post above, I'm sorry because I tried. Because really? The plan   was to watch Anime yesterday with the expectation that the package will arrive   so I can spend the rest of today doing it but... as you can see, this plan did   not go well. So yeah, don't expect too much here, just like how I am about   work right now lol probably woke up to such a dream actually. Really bad one   but I forgot most of it anyways. Cya guys next week then, and until next   time... take care of yourselves, people. You wonder what happened to me? Let's   see... Thursday there was a co-worker farewell lunch, Friday was a... Friday   lunch so don't expect cheap stuff lol and probably that one milk tea is when   my body said stop. Yep, didn't even finish the drink and it got me to this.   Sorry, my body, I don't know how to take care of you.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span title="*silence*">😐</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Bye.
