They can't die in that world... or can   they? Also, monkeys be dead already so</div><div><br /></div><div>  Okay, Anime time I guess! And new songs... well this week was kinda lacklustre   but next week though!! I like how all I remember is Asakura Momo hehe but yea   there is more happening next week but let's end this week first, yes?<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq anime" id="KanoKano07">    <div style="text-align: center;">      <span class="head-prefix"><b>アニメ</b></span><span style="font-size: large;"> Kanojo mo Kanojo</span>    </div>  </blockquote>  <blockquote class="tr_bq">    <div style="text-align: center;">      "I wouldn't have thought Milika-san would fall in love with Naoya-kun" I       mean, is that surprising though? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>     </div>  </blockquote>  You see, the best part about getting more girls into liking Naoya is these two   will be on more cosplay somehow lol why though? Seriously, why are we letting this man get away with all of this? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new episode   (#KanoKano07) where we hope cuteness is all it needs to get a man to stick   himself inside of you lmao okay I'll cut this out, looks like we still have a   lingering Milika fear in our hands. But before that, let's get some   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/kosupure" target="_blank">cosplay</a> going   shall we? And in case you have no idea about this costume party, let us talk   about it briefly since Naoya has to stick in his experience on it anyways lol.   Firstly, Saki-chan thought about how it would be possible to make sure Naoya   doesn't three-time on her this time around with whatever happened last week   with Milika which we are definitely sure Naoya just got himself another target   though he's technically refraining from accepting her just because (he already   has two girlfriends), and turns out in her trips back home since it's just   next door, the mother (who doesn't know of the number of people in Naoya's   house right now) suggested dressing up to show off I guess, her slim body and   cute smile and stuff I forgot because I'm not her boyfriend lol. Anyways, I   guess Saki-chan is going for the "I'll have him for dinner" approach, so- What   is that outfit anyways?? <span title="*laughs*">😆</span>   <a href="https://jisho.org/search/bani-ga-ru" target="_blank">Bunny girl</a>,   we call those, as they are typically represented in casinos, but yeah,   definitely got Naoya salivating and also everything else that is cute about   Saki-chan haha I get it, you can watch it for yourself but yeah, Saki-chan got   real happy the next day because of this. Boob grabbing, I mean. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Man,   imagine a world without Nagisa, these two would have such a wonderful time   together. <span title="*sigh*">😩</span> Haha anyways,&nbsp;Nagisa wondered what happened but she   won't be far in finding out the truth, because clearly just like how one would   clean up after their mess <span title="*wink*">😉</span>, Saki-chan just left her costume in the   laundry which isn't done by her so welp. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> And for round two, we have   Nagisa in... don't ask me why she brought with her a maid outfit because she can   use it someday? Really, how did you even start to buy these- Hey I thought she   would consider wearing that "used" bunny girl outfit but I guess not the chest   part since it probably wouldn't fit her HAHAHAHAHA, but yeah, it looks like Nagisa is   trying to get Naoya to praise her more, is the point. She did get it though,   with Naoya demanding she wear such an outfit once a week lol well you gotta   make sure the other girlfriend is out for a stroll and only considering of how she did it   with Naoya the night before then... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, such wonderful times I   thought this was the series until Milika showed up, but yeah, as they will   have found out about each other's appeals to the guy individually, no doubt   this will cause more ruckus when they have to compare their relationship to the   guy again, I assume. Last but not least though, we talk about Milika after the   protect. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Long story short, the trio did not know she is called Rika in   school lol almost gave her MeTube identity away, and   <strike>Milika</strike> Rika-chan here just wanted to thank Naoya for saving   her sub career which might just end up being her actual career because if you   have not heard of the life stories of content creators clinging onto shit ad   revenue and millions of views with their dear lives go search it online someone   will tell you the way. Just... think twice if you want to do so though, just   saying. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span> And Naoya just can't stop praising her which I must say is   waaaaaay too much considering his objective, like other normal guys, is just   to reject the girl "and please go find someone else better" type of situation, is not   stopping at the compliments, only making girls fall for him more. <span title="*silence*">😐</span> Is that   how you get girls to fall in love with you? Well too late, me, should've done   that in high school. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> All in all, fantastic episode as usual, maybe   too much on the cooch if you understand what I meant *looks at bunny girl   Saki-chan* but yeah, haha, I like some wholesomeness when two are alone,   that's for sure. And Nagisa don't you DARE wear a bunny girl ears plus maid   dress in front of your boy I will bleed so bad I will have to ask   <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/186042/Nagisa_Minase" target="_blank">Waki Azumi</a>  to do it haha <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv1WUM3HOln/?utm_medium=share_sheet" target="_blank">Ajuju~</a> Cya guys next week haha </div><div>  [TL:DR; I wished they put on a poll on their official Twitter to decide   whether Saki-chan or Nagisa wins this cosplay competition lmao (Personally I'm   pure so Nagisa also she has more chest haha Saki-chan no-)]   <div>    <div>      <div class="thumbnail">        <div class="thumbnail-initial hover-hidden">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDpWGggc2hQ/YRkaXiViCxI/AAAAAAABHRg/2HTFO5t6uREF63yCgFj1LwDgeOFqFdFtACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano07_couple2.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  This week on violence we have:<br />When your girl lets you                   sexually violate her but still get beat up for it lol                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="180" data-original-width="320" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N3a2LG4UGNU/YRkaZBVdrZI/AAAAAAABHRk/0GZYLcsEBpkOPE9UeRn85p8cz8DfXHNNQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/kanokano07_flying.gif" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  I think the next time I will be blown away to this extent I                   can date that girl haha                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>        <div class="thumbnail-initial thumbnail-pop hover-visible">          <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">            <tbody>              <tr>                <td style="text-align: center;">                  <img border="0" data-original-height="1697" data-original-width="1280" height="424" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XxmfY5K69MM/YRkbCXPhwjI/AAAAAAABHRw/TwbXlTgJSvY8SAS0PHOru6tyaLJszIsygCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/kanokano07_rika1.jpg" width="320" />                </td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">                  Blow me away, Rika-chan<br />(Haha)                 </td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>        </div>      </div>      P.S.

Haha, I mean, assuming no one lost their memory and the           perpetrator is evil... yeah Nagara isn't it. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> In this new           episode (#SonnyBoy05) where I finally believe that I've gotten it           right this time around in taking sides, that yes, the sensei is           totally wrong. So yeah, let her brainwash you for now, because she           doesn't know much like the rest of them anyways. Or maybe she does.           Let's talk about what happened. So, Aki-sensei appeared on the island,           and on the flashback as the student body sit to think about it           afterwards, she mentioned a couple of things that will make you doubt           otherwise. Firstly, they can't leave the world. Okay, nice joke, and           if that is so we might as well end this series now lol. Second, she           infers that it cannot be a coincidence in this happening, pointing out           that someone already has those superpowers to land them in this           alternate world in the first place, namely we have heard statements           from Mizuho and the Student Council apparently, but we aren't sure if           those were true. Lastly, she claims that Nagara was the cause of           everything, in an attempt to leave the real world, and implicating           everyone else in it. So yes, this is the bullshit part which, as           Nagara himself has no defence for it, will be the best way to divert           everyone's attention because every time he talks he can never win           against anyone, not even just any innocent classmate who can't do           anything but believe in the nonsense right now haha. It's like the           thing with Mizuho; it's not that he's not telling the truth, it's that           everyone doesn't trust him. Too bad, guys, game over for all of you.           But yes, just like how I like to make you think it's over, there is           salvation. God is salvation- Okay free thinker me, you can't say that.           <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, let's start doubting. Doubting as to why, Aki-sensei           here and apparently along with Asakaze, are the bad guys in this case.           I won't say they are the culprits here, but for now in this smaller           scope, yes. So firstly, Aki-sensei's words along with what we know so           far, even coming in from a doubtful student body including Bill Nye           right here haha. So don't trust me also because I'm also           second-guessing (remember where we are in the first place, watching an           original Anime series) (haha) but suffice it to say that why would           anyone trust some bimbo (hey Nozomi haha) who just walked into their           world and told them they were wrong without explaining how she           appeared in here? That, is still probably, the biggest mystery in           itself. Well, at least for this episode or from the previous one. Just this is already a pit hole for lies, if that isn't a good enough           hint. Everything else she does though, if you can believe, are traps           meant to point down on Nagara and his supposed powers to likely distract everyone in this. So yeah, trust her, I guess. Idiots. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Next           up, is what we know of Nagara himself. In Nagara and his pep talk with           Nozomi because we know they are a couple now hehe, Nozomi talks about           how he gives up easily, and where she gets all her courage to move           forward from. Inherent? Maybe. Absolute? Probably not. But yeah, she           isn't exactly wrong, but that's the problem in itself too: Some people           lack the willpower to find meaning in their lives for themselves. Read           up my terribly written novel series "A Pack of Life" for more           information about saving society. I'm not the saviour, Nagara is.           <span title="*wink*">😉</span> Moving on, which should be the biggest thing here so far, is           again, the lack of understanding we have of the rules of this world,           and also, the powers they possess. It's like how (sorry for obscure           reference but) one can           <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/3911/Yumichika_Ayasegawa" target="_blank">hide their zanpakuto identity</a>&nbsp;to deceive others about their true powers lol I'm sorry I           promise I won't do this again, in this case since we have mentioned           it's a growing up story just like how I mentioned many times here, is           that we have once again misunderstood Nagara's powers once more. He           doesn't have the ability to teleport between worlds, because it seems           like he can never teleport back to the previous ones as evidenced           before. Since his power is named "Escape", he can only escape, guess           what, to a new world. Which is probably what will lead us to the           ending for this episode, as we see Asakaze teaming up with Aki-sensei           to attempt to, you guessed it, get out of his hell scape. Think of           this as, if Bill Nye is correct lol, that they probably also cannot           reach anywhere since the one who can move to the supposed exit as           pointed out by Nozomi, is Nagara right here. So yeah, it's more like           they are closer than ever before... but not because of Asakaze. I           guess it did come back full circle, huh. Not that I know what this           means though. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I know right, what is with this long write-up.           Well, we shall see what those two have up their sleeve, maybe we will           really see Nagara in trouble or pain even, but that we shall see how           it goes. May not be good news for the lot of them, to say the least.

I still don't know what to make of this series, to be honest.           Lies are all around to prevent you from believing in the truth, and I           still think that Hoshi is like, the devil here making sure no one           leaves this game of torture.

Oh, how I ended up with           <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/gift-rocks-ep/1574861755?l=en" target="_blank">a flood of circle's 15th anniversary album</a></b> is also because of a           YouTube video haha. Ah hey. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Anyways, that EP-like release of           songs written by other artists for them plus an acoustic cover of them           covering other people's songs... I only listened to the former and           threw away all the good songs so I gave a couple of songs which I did           not intend to give, once again, because they sound better overall.           Also, UNISON SQUARE GARDEN, I'm that bored of your style already, I           rather listen to that vocalist who created his own band XIIX since it           has more vibes than whatever you've come up with here lol. Hey, it's a           bit touchy but doesn't mean people won't like it. Just, I don't.           <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Other than that I did listen to           <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/best-of-the-best/1577381273?l=en" target="_blank">SPYAIR's complete best album</a></b> worth of 30+ songs at work but did           not record of anything notable, probably because I'm not sitting there           doing it attentively. <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> So yeah, next time, guys. And I'm not           going to mention all the songs newbie voice actress (and my new love           question mark?) Kanno Mai's recommendations through her Instagram           stories just because.<br />          <br />On news concerning music that is on Twitter and of course on my           feed or if I saw it otherwise,           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/oral_official/status/1426831789230751744?s=20" target="_blank">THE ORAL CIGARETTES is doing a livestream on next Wednesday</a></b>          this is literally a translated Tweet haha, I don't think I will be           listening to           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1426747687886462976?s=20" target="_blank">Ishihara Kaori's new single with yanaginagi on the lyrics</a></b> but           hey the latter did tell me about it so I guess I'll just mention here           lol, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/lucklife_info/status/1426735074897055748?s=20" target="_blank">LuckLife's new song is releasing end of the month</a></b> and I           swear a formal release is coming soon, if you have watched Naobou's           summer vacation livestream with 2 other guests I think I know them           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/naobou_official/status/1426513942898216961?s=20" target="_blank">Touyama Nao's new single is for Anime due November</a></b>,           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/trysail_staff/status/1426469895823310848?s=20" target="_blank">Asakura Momo's new song preview</a></b> is for her upcoming single and           I'll talk about it next week anyways so not here,           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Yogees_band/status/1425110509418946563?s=20" target="_blank">Yogee New Waves' new music video</a></b> is for their upcoming album           and though it's short but it got me in the middle of summer I just say           (the end of the chorus is literally good bye in FOUR languages FYI),           and finally there are           <b>digest videos of <a href="https://twitter.com/AyanaTake_Music/status/1425745620870963202?s=20" target="_blank">Taketatsu Ayana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/yanaginagi/status/1424954261708886017?s=20" target="_blank">yanaginagi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IKIMONOofficial/status/1424901972105175043?s=20" target="_blank">Ikimonogakari's             recent lives</a> on YouTub</b>e. Yes, the last one was Ikimonogakari before it became a two-piece           band... Hey remember FINLANDS is now one-piece so <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> I'm just           glad they are still around man...<br />          <br />So for next week, we have a couple of release coming up           hopefully making this month something to remember, long time coming           <b><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/album/%E7%A5%9E%E7%84%A1-kanna-ep/1574302173?l=en" target="_blank">miwa's new single</a></b> so I hope it's good lol recent ones have not           been impressive as in it's overly impressive imo,           <b>Asakura Momo's new single</b> because yes I watch Anime "Kanojo mo           Kanojo", and I think I will need some time to listen to           <b>Ueda Reina's new album</b> if I really want to give her chance.           Hey, I'm giving more chances to albums in recent years and I pride           myself on it instead of simping on topic songs, so I hope topic songs           in the future can continue to entice me to listen and credit songs in           future releases. That's the whole point man, we can't just live with           the one song. Well, most of you guys are so Klassic Note remains the           right to keep silent. <span title="*giggles*">🤭</span>         </div>        <div>          <br />          <br />          <br />          <br />This is all, I guess. News that were on Twitter and I can't put           in the music part is... we have one good news and one bad one. I guess           bad one first huh. Bad news is more on me, the mobile game and my           first Japanese one I've played for 5 years which they recently           haphazardly celebrated ie.           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/alterna_girls/status/1425338412324691972?s=20" target="_blank">Alternative Girls is declaring its end by October</a></b> which only made me           sadder because (1) fans have noted its impending end especially with the development studio picking up on IDOLY PRIDE's video game two months ago (which I am ironically playing) (ugh I hate myself haha) and (2) I shared my experience with ma bro on how I'm simping on           Futon-chan now... <span title="*laughs*">😆</span> Good news is, ironically for a doujin manga           (depending on how you look at it) but I guess it's ranking tops every           time it releases a new volume,           <b><a href="https://twitter.com/y_o_m_y_o_m/status/1426362954174271491?s=20" target="_blank">"Ganbare Douki-chan" is getting an Anime adaptation!!</a></b> Didn't           expect this honestly, but I did support it by buying FOUR volumes so           far and probably will be getting the fifth, so that'll make the author           real happy haha. Hey, easy come easy go, I guess. I just... don't feel           like being sad.         </div>        <div><br /></div>        <div>Like injecting a vaccine into my weak body.<br /></div>      </div>    </div>  </div></div><div><br /></div><div>Cya guys next week haha</div><hr><h4>#The Entertainment News</h4><h6 style="text-align: center;">Copyright (c) 2014-2023 Klassic Note Web Reports</h6><br><br><br><br></div>
